Fukuyama draws from Hegel to argue that humans inherently seek recognition, which is satisfied by liberal democracy.
This assumes that all societies value individualism and democratic participation in the same way (Mouffe, 2000).

"can you help me to rewrite the introduction to answer the question ""Class conflict remains the main threat to democracy in rich countries.’ Discuss. "" ""Class conflict has always been a threat and a need for democracy to exist. However, as Moore (1966) argued “no bourgeoisie, no democracy”. Historically, elites, especially the bourgeoisie, have played a key role in fostering democratic institutions, ensuring stability, and providing governance expertise. Lower and middle classes are as relevant as the higher classes, but have they ever been considered as such?  This essay will argue that while class conflict is relevant in the stability of democracies in rich countries, it might not be what threatens democracy but elite domination. Elites are the ones dominating democracies (in economic terms), however, with the rise of the extreme right-wing, this economic support is threatened as they are starting to see democracy as a threat to their elite status. Elites have helped create democracies, as Barrington Moore argues, but if they hold too much power, they can weaken democracy. A stable democracy needs strong checks to keep them accountable while allowing broad participation. For this, it will first explore how elites contributed to democracy, then examine the risks of elite dominance, and finally argue for a balanced approach where democracy constrains but does not exclude elites.",Light Offloading,Light Offloading
"based on these notes, give me a detailed essay plan for this essay: What impact might populism have on state bureaucracies?
INTRO
Thesis: Populism leverage media outlets that increase polarization and undermine democratic stability 
Essay plan: 

ARGUMENT: 
 Traditionally, political parties were the primary conduits through which information reached voters, using newspapers and other conventional media channels to present their issues, programs, and campaigns. However, the advent of new media, particularly television and online news outlets, as highlighted by Norris (2005) and Barisone (2009), has empowered voters with direct access to a wider and less nuanced range of political opinions and perspectives. This has fundamentally altered the dynamics of political communication, allowing individuals to independently assess their options outside the lens of party-centric perspectives. (Grazia et al., 2020) This increased autonomy in information consumption has contributed to the declining significance of traditional political institutions like political parties and interest groups. Voters are no longer bound by the narrow information provided by party platforms; instead, they can form opinions based on a more diverse option of sources. As a consequence, the traditional party loyalty that characterised earlier decades crumbled, giving rise to a more fluid and unpredictable political landscape (Grazia et al., 2020).
 → Mass media, particularly television and social media, has reduced the influence of traditional party structures and encouraged voters to focus on individual leaders rather than party ideologies.
Shift in voting patterns towards single, charismatic leaders who act as spokespersons for personal issues and ideals, regardless of the party to which they belong (McAllister and Quinlan, 2019). The last four decades have witnessed the emergence of populist leaders who leverage social media platforms to directly engage with voters. This personalised and individualistic approach to politics has diminished the importance of mainstream parties, as voters increasingly identify with leaders rather than party ideologies (Barison, 2009). As a result, political preferences started being influenced by prime leaders’ characteristics and likability, as opposed to broader policy considerations. This trend contributes to a more fragmented political landscape, where voters prioritise individualistic and often emotional connections with leaders over traditional party affiliations (Grazia et al., 2020).
→ media-driven personalization of politics has led to a situation in which voters prioritize the image, rhetoric, and media presence of individual politicians over party ideologies (Barisone, 2009). Unlike traditional parties that relied on policy platforms and organizational structures, populist leaders leverage media environments to cultivate personal brands that transcend party affiliations.

Rather than fostering a pluralistic public sphere, the contemporary digital landscape isolates voters into ideological echo chambers, where exposure to opposing viewpoints is systematically reduced (Tucker et al., 2018). In such an environment, party-based affiliations are weakened, as voters become more emotionally and personally connected to individual leaders rather than party platforms. As Bail et al. (2018) found, when individuals encounter political messages from ideological opponents, they frequently react defensively, further entrenching their beliefs rather than reconsidering them. This phenomenon—often referred to as the backfire effect—benefits populist leaders who frame themselves as political outsiders fighting against the establishment, reinforcing their direct connection with voters while eroding the influence of traditional parties

COUNTERARGUMENT: why is bad for democracy 
1.  when confronted with anti-democratic behaviour by their preferred party, most voters are unwilling to penalise it if it benefits the opposing party 
2. citizens become more susceptible to disinformation → undermining institutional trust
3.  exposure to ideological diversity now depends less on the inherent social 
Media is creating Tribalism (political affiliation is not about policy disagreements but structural, identity-based phenomenon - relational → tinder ex. Mccoy) 
Brexit → same “us vs. them” dynamic, cultural issue ( leave vs remain identity) Carter, 2024 

EVALUATION: 
News Media Literacy (provide citizens with the tools to recognise bias, evaluate credibility, and navigate media environments) + active engagement. 
!! Important !!: reforms to be designed in ways that uphold democratic principles while minimising the risk of political weaponisation
Why just exposing ourselves to different perspectives isn’t enough? 
1. Reactance bias: reject information that contradicts their beliefs → individuals prioritise attitude-consistent content over credibility (post-truth era) 
2. Backfire effect: Defensive reaction when individuals are confronted with political messages from ideological opponents, reinforcing their pre-existing beliefs",Heavy Offloading,Heavy Offloading

"I need to answer this question: ""bureaucracy makes foreign policies, not leaders. Discuss.""; does this structure make sense to answer the question: Focus on intra-nation factors such as how governmental actions result from bargaining among players within the government who hold diverse interests → It is a realistic framework for analyzing FP decisions rather than assuming rationality
Strengths 
Explain inconsistencies in foreign policy better than rational choice
Accounts for bureaucratic competition and internal power  
It helps to analyze failures and inconsistencies in government decision-making 
The better explanation 
What drives Foreign Policy
Competition, bargaining or negotiation 
It can be national interest or the agency’s goals → multiplayer analysis is needed 
Key players 
President as a formal authority 
Cabinet officials as agency’s interests 
Military and intelligence officials shape perception of threat 
Congress, public opinion, and interest groups 
Where you stand depends on where you sit → subjectivity and bias 
Allison et al, 1972 
Bureaucratic bargaining → Government decisions are made through bargaining and compromise among the different players 
Organizational interests → Governments seek to protect and expand their influence, budgets and missions 
Three decision-making models 
Rational action model (RAM) 
States behave as unitary, rational actors pursuing strategic objectives, weighing costs and benefits to maximize national costs 
BUT → ignores psychological factors and bureaucratic constraints 
Rejection of unitary actor → Governments are composed of multiple players with diverse objectives 
Example → U.S. deciding to blockade Cuba in 1962
Organizational Process Model (OPM) 
Governments consist of large bureaucratic organizations following Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) 
Foreign Policy is shaped by what bureaucratic can do, not just what leaders want to do
Example → US military response in Vietnam followed SOPs rather than grand strategies 
Bureaucratic Politics Model (BPM) 
Government decisions emerge from bargaining among political and bureaucratic actors 
Foreign policy is shaped by competition between bureaucracy intents, political rivalry and institutional constraints. 
Example → Pentagon vs State Department disputes in Cold War diplomacy approach.  


Krasner, 1972 → Critiques 
Refutes BPM as misleading, analytically weak and politically problematic because: 
Undermines democratic accountability because as bureaucratic dictate policy, leaders are prisoners of bureaucracy and elections are “meaningless” 
Fails to expain radical and major policy cganges, which require strong executive leaderships 
It is deterministic, neglecting human agency, leadership vision and values. 
LEADERSHIP ROLE 
Leadership as a multifaceted process that involves shaping national strategy, managing crises, and integrating diverse perspectives from within and outside the government. 
Strategic Vision and Crisis Management
Leaders set the strategic vision that defines a nation’s interest on the global stage. 
Their personal worldviews and historical insights often determine how national interests are defined and pursued.
Henry Kissinger (1994) → how leaders draw on historical context and strategic calculation to navigate complex international landscapes;  underscores the importance of balancing power politics with diplomatic engagement.
In moments of international tension, strong leadership is crucial.
 The ability to quickly assess threats, coordinate responses, and maintain composure under pressure distinguishes effective foreign policy leadership.
Graham Allison(1972) → decisions are not solely the outcome of rational calculations but also of bureaucratic politics and the personal dispositions of leaders. 
Individual leadership styles can shape how crises are managed, often determining whether a situation escalates or is contained.
Effective foreign policy requires the integration of insights from military, diplomatic, economic, and intelligence communities. 
Leaders must synthesize these often divergent views into a coherent strategy.
Robert Putnam (1988)  “two-level game” theory → leaders simultaneously negotiate with domestic stakeholders and international counterparts. 
This dual-level engagement means that successful foreign policy hinges on a leader’s ability to balance internal political constraints with external diplomatic demands.
Leadership in foreign policy is not only about military might or economic leverage but also about shaping global perceptions.
Nye (1990) → soft power highlights how cultural influence, diplomatic engagement, and the projection of national values can be pivotal in achieving foreign policy goals. Leaders who effectively harness soft power can foster goodwill and create a more favorable international environment for their country’s interests.",Heavy Offloading,Heavy Offloading

ELECTORAL SYSTEMS 
3 main electoral systems : 
Majoritarian systems - where a country is divided into several single-member districts 
SMP single member plurality system (UK)
Two-round system (France)
Alternative voting system (Australia)
Proportional systems - a country is divided into one or more multi-party districts 
Closed-list PR (Spain)
Open-list PR (Denmark)
Single-transferable vote (Ireland)
Mixed system - both single-member district and multi-member district 
Mixed-member proportional (Germany)
Mixed-member majoritarian (Japan)
MAJORITARIAN SYSTEMS: 
Single-Member District system: a country is divided in as many districts as seats in the parliament, each district has an equal number of voters. Each party presents one candidate in each district, or individual politicians stand as independent candidates. Each voter votes for one candidate, the one with most votes gets elected 
First-past-the-post: single round of voting, the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins the election, regardless of whether they achieve an absolute majority (more than 50% of the votes).
Two-round system: Country divided into districts, 1 candidate / district. Election is held over 2 rounds 14 days apart. In the first round elections are held as the SMP, if a candidate wins more than 50% in the district they’re elected immediately. However, if no one reaches the 50%+1, a second round of voting is held between the two top candidates 
Alternative vote: A country is divided into as many districts as there are seats in the parliament, each district elects one member of parliament, and (usually) each party presents only one candidate in each district (or individuals stand as independents). Citizens ‘rank’ the candidates in their preferred order. If no candidate wins at least 50 per cent of all first preferences votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is then eliminated and their ‘second preferences’ are re-allocated to the remaining candidate. This process continues until someone wins at least 50 per cent of the votes 
Features:
Simple Voting Process: In FPTP, each constituency elects one representative. Voters cast a single vote for their preferred candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins, regardless of whether they achieve a majority.
Candidate-Centric: Although party affiliations play a significant role, the electoral system formally focuses on individual candidates, allowing for the possibility, albeit rare, of independents winning seats based on personal merit or local issues.
Consequences: 
Disproportionality: Both systems can result in a significant mismatch between the percentage of the national vote a party receives and its share of seats in the legislature. This often benefits larger parties or those with geographically concentrated support.
Government Stability: These systems tend to favor the formation of single-party governments with clear majorities, enhancing stability and decisiveness but potentially at the cost of broader representativeness.
Two-Party Dominance: Especially under FPTP, the electoral system encourages a two-party system due to the difficulty for smaller parties to win seats unless they have substantial regional support.
Strategic Voting: Voters may vote not for their first choice but for a less preferred option that has a better chance of winning, to prevent a least desired outcome.
Limited Representation of Minorities: Both systems are generally less capable of ensuring representation for smaller parties and minority groups unless those groups are regionally concentrated.
ALTERNATIVE VOTING and TWO-PARTY are firmly tied to the advent of technology 
PROPORTIONAL SYSTEMS: 
characterized by their use of multi-member constituencies, where several representatives are elected per district. These systems aim to allocate seats in proportion to the votes received, aiming for a more accurate reflection of voter preferences across a political spectrum
CL-PRS: Each party then presents a list of candidates in each district. The candidates on each party list are presented in a particular order, which determines which candidates are elected if a party wins a particular number of seats. Citizens then vote for one and only one party list. Once all the votes are cast, seats are allocated to parties in each district in proportion to the votes they received in that district. 
No incentive for personal campaign
High party cohesion
Low individual accountability for politicians
OP-PRS: each party presents a list of candidates in each district. Again, the candidates on each party list are usually presented in a particular order. However, rather than the party having full control over the order in which candidates are elected, under OLPR, citizens can use their votes in the election to change the order of the candidates on the lists, and so overturn the order proposed by a party. citizens can usually either vote for a party list (a ‘party vote’) or can vote for an individual candidate ‘personal vote’). Seats are then allocated to parties in proportion to the total votes they receive in a district (their party votes plus the personal votes to the party’s candidates). And, seats are allocated to candidates within parties according to the number of personal votes each candidate receives. 
Incentive for personal campaign
Low party cohesion
High individual accountability for politicians
STV: voters ‘rank’ the candidates in their preferred order. Once the polling stations are closed the first preferences for each candidate in a district are counted. If any candidate reaches a ‘quota’ of votes, they are elected. The quota in a district is the minimum number of votes a candidate must get to be elected. As soon as any candidate reaches the quota they are elected. If a candidate receives more than the quota, the surplus votes are transferred to the remaining candidates in proportion to the voters’ next available preference. 
Features:
Multi-Member Constituencies
Electoral Thresholds: Some PR systems include a threshold that parties must exceed to gain representation, which prevents very small parties from entering the legislature.
Consequences: 
Greater Proportionality: PR systems are designed to reduce the discrepancies between the percentage of votes received and the percentage of seats awarded to parties, leading to legislatures that more accurately reflect the electorate's preferences.
Increased Party Diversity: Due to the proportional nature of seat allocation, PR systems often result in a greater number of political parties being represented in the parliament compared to majoritarian systems.
Coalition Governments: As no single party typically wins an outright majority, PR systems often lead to the formation of coalition governments. This requires parties to negotiate and collaborate, potentially leading to more consensus-based governance.
Voter and minority Representation: Voters might feel more represented as smaller parties and minority interests can gain seats more proportionally aligned with their electoral support.
MIXED ELECTORAL SYSTEM: Mixed electoral systems combine elements of both majoritarian and proportional representation systems, aiming to capitalize on the benefits of each while mitigating their drawbacks. In mixed systems like MMP and MMM, voters typically have two votes: one for a candidate in a single-member district using a majoritarian method and another for a party list in a larger multi-member region, which may be proportional (MMP) or not linked to district results (MMM). These systems allow for both direct territorial representation through district-elected MPs and broader, more proportional representation through party lists. This ensures that both local concerns and broader national or regional party strengths are represented.
MMP: the party-list seats are allocated to compensate those parties who have not won enough single- member seats given their overall vote share in an election. In each region, parties win seats in proportion to the number of party-list votes they receive in a region, irrespective of how many votes they won in the single-member districts. 
MMM: the party-list seats are allocated in proportion to the votes received by parties in the multi-member party-list constituencies, independently from the votes in the single-member districts.The multi-member party-list seats are then allocated in proportion to the share of second votes each party received in each regional district. 
Consequences: 
Enhanced Voter Choice: Voters can support a local candidate from one party and a different party for the list vote, allowing for greater expression of voter preferences.
Increased Proportionality (MMP): By adjusting list seats to compensate for the disproportionality of single-member district results, MMP can lead to a legislature that closely mirrors the overall party preference of the electorate.
Potential for Overhang Seats (MMP): If a party wins more district seats than its proportional share, additional seats (overhang seats) may be added, which can increase the size of the legislature.
No Compensation for Disproportionality (MMM): Since MMM does not link the list vote to the district results, it can result in a less proportional representation compared to MMP. This system can favor larger parties, similar to majoritarian systems.
Complexity and Voter Understanding: The dual nature of these systems can confuse voters, particularly in understanding how their votes influence legislative outcomes.
Coalition Governments (MMP): MMP often leads to coalition governments, especially when no single party can command a majority alone, promoting broader consensus in policy-making.
Electoral Engineering (MMM): Without compensatory mechanisms, MMM can allow for strategic manipulation by parties, such as concentrating campaign resources in winnable single-member districts while neglecting broader representation.
Diverse Legislative Representation: Both systems encourage a mix of party-focused and individually focused politics, where some members focus on constituency issues and others on national party agendas.
PR systems maximise representation, they produce parliaments which are microcosm of society 
They tend to produce multi-party coalition governments, which are less accountable than single-party 
Less clarity of responsibility 
MAJ systems lead to big shift in seats, prioritise big parties 
Duverger’s law: majoritarian systems tend to produce two-party systems and single party governments, which are more accountable and clarity of responsibility, but can be highly unrepresentative. PR tend to produce multi-party systems. 
In electoral systems where voters cast a single vote for one candidate in a single-member district, such as those found in the United States and the United Kingdom, Duverger observed a tendency toward a two-party system. This is because voters are incentivized to strategically vote for one of the two leading parties to prevent ""wasting"" their votes on a candidate with little chance of winning. In contrast, electoral systems based on proportional representation, such as those used in many European countries, allocate seats in proportion to the share of votes received by each party. This encourages the representation of a wider range of political parties, as smaller parties have a greater chance of winning seats even if they do not achieve a plurality of votes in any single district. This have to do with: 
Duverger (1951) mechanical effect: how electoral rules turns vote into seats, some systems are inherently biased as they are built in a way that contribute to the concentration of political power among larger parties and the marginalization of smaller parties - FPTP systems allocates a disproportionate share of the legislative seats to large parties. 
Duverger (1951) psychological effect: the electoral system shape voters expectation of the outcome. Suggests that voters tend to perceive that only two parties have a realistic chance of winning elections in plurality systems, which influences their voting decisions and contributes to the consolidation of a two-party system. The perception of limited electoral options can lead voters to engage in strategic voting, where they strategically support one of the two dominant parties to prevent the election of their least preferred candidate. Strategic voting is driven by the belief that voting for a smaller party is futile or may inadvertently help the candidate or party they least prefer to win. This strategic behavior further reinforces the dominance of the two-party system.
Cox (1997): According to Duverger's logic, electoral systems with single-member districts and majoritarian voting tend to lead to a two-party system, where voters strategically align themselves with the top two parties in each constituency. However, Cox argues that while this logic may apply at the constituency level, it does not necessarily hold true at the national level. He suggests that voters should strategically coordinate around parties with a realistic chance of winning in each electoral district. In single-member districts, this would typically involve focusing on the battle between the top two parties. However, Cox highlights that the top two parties may vary across different districts within a country, particularly in geographically heterogeneous societies like Canada and the UK. In such cases, even though the electoral system is designed to produce a two-party system, the diversity and regional variations in voter preferences can result in a multi-party system, often leading to coalition governments rather than single-party governments.
At the constituency level Duverger’s law (1951) works : e.g. Scotland —> it doesn’t work at national level (if geographical concentration of preferences is different, even if there’s a two-party system at contituency level, when you put all the constituencies together you’ll end up with a multi-party parliament) 
If Duverger doesn’t work. 
1 TRADE-OFF: The trade-off between a representative parliament and an accountable government. Should a parliament fairly represent citizens’ vote choices in elections, or should a country have a stable and identifiable single- party government? 
CAREY AND HIX (2011): THE ELECTORAL SWEET SPOT 
—> choosing an electoral system comes with a trade-off: you have to choose between representation and accountable government
1. REPRESENTATION 
PR systems turn votes into seats —> inclusive parliament / close mapping between the median member of parliament and median member of electorate on a left-right ideology scale 
Majoritarian electoral systems tend to produce less inclusive parliaments (no majority without 50%+1 of votes)
Modified systems: A legal threshold—say, 5% of national votes—can reduce party system fragmentation considerably by denying any representation to parties with vote shares below the threshold. It might also encourage voter coordination, provided that voters can accurately assess which parties are likely to fall above and below the mark, and that those voters who prefer below- threshold contestants are willing to cast their ballots for less-preferred-but-viable parties. 
2. ACCOUNTABILITY
PR systems produce skepticism: can produce broad coalitions, and coalition governments tend to be less able to change existing policies (tsebelis, 2002) —> policy conflicts inside coalition gov. Are resolved by accommodating the public spending priorities of all involved parties, leading to higher spending and higher deficits (persson and tabellini, 2003) 
Voters may not know a priori how their votes will determine which party or parties govern and which policies will then result 
Moreover: Cognitive psychology has long posited that humans are capable of distinguishing clearly among a limited set of choices along a single dimension, but that this capacity drops off sharply once the number of options rises to seven or above (Miller 1956) 
The electoral sweet spot is an attempt to, without using mixed election systems, have a compromise between government accountability and parliament representation trade-off; the best way to do it is to have a multimember district of moderate magnitude of around 4-8 representatives.
POSSIBLE SOLUTION: practitioners who seek to design an electoral system that maximizes these competing objectives are best served by choosing multimember districts of moderate magnitude (how many people are elected for each district - ideally 4-8). SMD systems tend to produce a small number of parties and simpler government coalitions, but also a relatively unrepresentative parliament. On the other side, large multimember districts have highly representative parliaments, but also a high fragmented party system and unwieldy multiparty coalition governments. 
—> small multimember districts (median number of 4/8 seats) tend to have highly representative parliaments and a moderate number of parties in parliaments and in government 
(Number of members of parliament elected for each circle - how many members of parliament are elected for electoral size circle (e.g. regions): the sweet spot is district magnitude should be between 4-8)
Only works for a ideal country (not taking into account historian regions, social heterogeneity) 
Carey (2009) describes a trend in electoral reform towards systems that allow voters to cast preference for individual candidates —> voters exercise their option when given —> party cohesion problem 
Low magnitude (limited number of options) make it possible to combine candidate preference votes and individual accountability with proportionality and partisan inclusiveness 
—>  allows for the combination of individual preferences with accountability, ensuring proportionality in representation and inclusiveness of different political parties. 
CRITICS: 
parties define electoral system, and they are hard to change 
We can’t have a perfect electoral system because it needs to be context base : society is not homogeneous (in of cleavages, etc..)
2 TRADE-OFF: The trade-off between cohesive parties and accountable politicians. Should parties be centralised and cohesive, so they can deliver on their electoral promises, or should citizens be able to choose between politicians from the same political party (which increases individual accountability)? 
Do we prefer a system where parties can deliver coherent policies at the potential expense of individual responsiveness, or do we value politicians who are highly responsive to their constituents but may act in ways that undermine party unity and policy coherence? Each system presents a different balance of these values, influencing how effectively a democracy can respond to the will of its people versus how effectively it can implement coherent policies.
Party cohesion 
Easier policy implementation : are more likely to work together to pass legislation and effectively execute the party's platform —> makes also the whole government more stable 
People often base their ideology on left or right scale, and it’s easier to recognise themselves in parties. When politicians maintain party cohesion, they reinforce this identification
(Carey and Shugart, 1995)
Closed-List Proportional Representation (CLPR) Systems
High Party Cohesion: In CLPR systems, party leaders control the candidate lists and their order. This top-down structure ensures that party policies are paramount, leading to cohesive party actions in the legislature.
Low Individual Accountability: Since voters cannot choose among individual candidates within a party, politicians have less incentive to be responsive to specific voter needs. Their political survival depends more on their party's overall success and internal dynamics rather than direct voter feedback.
Preferential Voting Systems (OLPR and STV)
High Individual Accountability: These systems allow voters to select between multiple candidates from the same party, thus fostering direct accountability. Politicians must appeal to voters on the basis of their individual merits and distinctiveness from their party colleagues.
Low Party Cohesion: The independence afforded to candidates can lead to less unified parties. Leaders have less control over party ranks, and party discipline in legislative actions may be weaker, as candidates focus on personal voter relationships over party strategy.
Single-Member District Systems (SMP, TRS, AV)
Individual Politician Focus: These systems encourage candidates to differentiate themselves based on personal policies and performance. Politicians may develop a personal appeal to gain electoral support independent of their party's platform.
Constrained Voter Choice: Like in mixed systems, voters cannot choose between multiple candidates from the same party, which might force them to choose between party loyalty and candidate preference.
Mixed Electoral Systems (MMP and MMM)
Moderate Individual Accountability and Cohesion: These systems provide a balance by combining elements from both single-member district systems and proportional representation. Candidates in single-member districts can cultivate a personal voter base, promoting individual accountability. However, party cohesion is still maintained through party-controlled list placements in the proportional component.
Voter Choice Limitation: In single-member districts within these systems, voters still face a lack of choice between candidates from the same party, which can limit direct accountability.
Is there a best of both worlds? 
MODIFIED PR SYSTEM : These systems, often involving small multi-member districts with modifications like electoral thresholds and winner's bonuses, aim to foster both party cohesion and electoral competition. They allow for a certain degree of party cohesion by giving seat boosts to larger parties, thereby facilitating easier coalition formation and stable government. At the same time, they maintain a competitive electoral environment where medium-sized and geographically concentrated parties can still gain representation, ensuring that these parties remain accountable to specific electorates.
small multi-member districts, which provide a seat-boost for larger parties yet allow medium-sized parties or geographically concentrated parties to win some seats (as in Denmark, Spain, Portugal or the Czech Republic) 
a high electoral threshold, such as a 5 per cent minimum to win a seat, which prevents very small parties from winning seats and so makes coalition formation easier (as in Germany, Sweden, Hungary and Turkey) 
a ‘winner’s bonus’, which provides extra seats to the largest party or parties in the election, to provide incentives for voters to coordinate on the largest parties and for parties to try to win a majority of seats and so form a single-party government (as in Greece and Italy, since 2006) 
MMM systems, which provide a significant boost for large parties, who can win many of the single-member district seats, while allowing smaller parties to win some seats from the multi-member party-list tier (as in Japan, South Korea or Taiwan).
Carey, J.M. and M. Shugart (1995) ‘Incentives to Cultivate a Personal Vote’ (2 trade-off) 
Seat allocation formulas affect candidates' incentives to campaign on a personal rather than party reputation. Variables that enhance personal vote- seeking include: (1) lack of party leadership control over access to and rank on ballots, (2) degree to which candidates are elected on individual votes independent of co-partisans, and (3) whether voters cast a single intra-party vote instead of multiple votes or a party-level vote. 
If a party has more candidates than the number of seats it wins, then the electoral formula must specify a means for determining which candidates take the party's seats. The model is based on just four variables common to all electoral systems: 
ballot control: measures the degree of control party leaders exercise over access to their party's label, and control over ballot rank in electoral list systems. When leaders exercise strong ballot control, the incentive for a politician to cultivate a personal reputation is minimized; but when ballot control is weak, personal reputation is more valuable. 
vote pooling: measures whether votes cast in the general election are pooled across entire parties, or among factions or candidates, or are not pooled at all. VOTES variable distinguishes among systems in which voters are allowed to cast only a single vote for a party, multiple votes, or a single vote for a candidate. The value to legislative candidates of personal reputation is lowest in the first case, moderate in the second, and highest in the last.   
types of votes: measures the number and types of votes cast; 
district magnitude. 
In open list personal reputation is more valuable to legislative candidates than in closed list systems. But there is no systematic, universal model to account for the value of personal reputation under the broad range of electoral rules according to which legislators around the world are elected) 
Lijphart (2012) Patterns of democracy: government forms and performance in 36 countries - CH 8
Electoral systems play a fundamental role in shaping democratic governance. They determine how votes are translated into seats, thereby affecting representation, party systems, government stability, and overall democratic legitimacy. Electoral system design is one of the most consequential decisions for a democracy, as it shapes political competition, influences voter behavior, and determines how power is distributed within society. In comparative politics, Arend Lijphart offers a seminal analysis of electoral systems, emphasizing the differences between majority/plurality systems and proportional representation (PR) systems, which are often linked to broader models of democracy—majoritarian and consensus models.
At the heart of any electoral system is the method by which votes are converted into seats. This process can be categorized into two broad approaches: plurality/majority systems and proportional representation systems (PR). These systems differ in their objectives, operational logic, and political consequences.
Plurality and Majority Systems: Plurality and majority systems operate on the principle of ""winner-takes-all,"" where only the candidate or party with the most votes wins the seat. While plurality systems require only a simple plurality (the most votes) to win, majority systems require an absolute majority (more than 50% of the vote). These systems prioritize decisiveness and government stability over proportional representation. There are several variants of this system:
First Past the Post (FPTP): Used in countries like the United Kingdom, the United States, and India, where the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins. It requires no absolute majority, only the largest share of votes.
Two-Round System (TRS): Employed in presidential elections in France, where a second round of voting is held if no candidate wins an outright majority in the first round.
Alternative Vote (AV): Used in Australia, where voters rank candidates in order of preference, and votes are redistributed until one candidate receives an absolute majority.
Proportional Representation (PR) Systems: Unlike plurality/majority systems, PR seeks to ensure that political representation corresponds as closely as possible to the proportion of votes received by each party. PR systems emphasize fairness in representation and inclusivity in governance, enabling smaller parties and minority groups to gain parliamentary representation. PR has several forms:
List PR: Used in the Netherlands and Israel, where political parties submit lists of candidates, and seats are distributed proportionally to the percentage of votes each party receives.
Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP): A hybrid system used in Germany and New Zealand that combines single-member district elections with proportional allocation of seats.
Single Transferable Vote (STV): Used in Ireland and Malta, where voters rank candidates in multi-member districts, and surplus votes are transferred to other candidates according to voter preferences.
While both approaches seek to translate votes into seats, they differ significantly in how they achieve this goal, with profound implications for party competition, electoral fairness, and governance.

Key Attributes of Electoral Systems
To understand how electoral systems operate, it is essential to analyze the key design features that shape electoral outcomes. Lijphart identifies several critical components of electoral systems that influence their functionality and political impact.
Electoral Formula: This refers to the mathematical method by which votes are converted into seats. Plurality/majority systems use a simple ""winner-takes-all"" rule, while PR uses proportional allocation.
Example: In FPTP, if a candidate wins 40% of the vote in a district, they win the seat, even if 60% of voters preferred other candidates. In PR, that 40% of votes would translate to roughly 40% of seats.
District Magnitude: Refers to the number of representatives elected in a given district. Plurality/majority systems typically use single-member districts, while PR systems use multi-member districts.
Impact: Larger district magnitudes in PR systems allow for greater proportionality, as more seats can be distributed among multiple parties. Small district magnitudes, as seen in Spain, reduce proportionality.
Electoral Thresholds: PR systems often include a threshold, which is the minimum percentage of votes a party needs to enter parliament.
Example: Germany has a 5% threshold, ensuring that only parties with significant support enter parliament. This prevents excessive party fragmentation but can exclude smaller parties from representation.
Size of the Legislature: The size of a country's parliament affects proportionality. Larger legislatures (like Germany) enhance proportionality, while smaller legislatures (like Barbados) increase disproportionality.
Impact: Smaller legislatures limit the number of available seats, making it harder for small parties to gain representation.
Malapportionment: Malapportionment occurs when districts have unequal population sizes, leading to unequal representation.
Example: Gerrymandering in the U.S. is a form of malapportionment where district boundaries are redrawn to favor a particular party.
Interparty Links: Some systems allow for party coalitions to combine their votes to win seats collectively.
Example: Systems like Switzerland and the Netherlands allow small parties to pool votes to surpass electoral thresholds.
Effects on Party Systems and Representation
The choice of an electoral system shapes the structure of the party system and the nature of political representation. Plurality/majority systems produce party consolidation, while PR systems encourage party proliferation.
Two-Party vs. Multiparty Systems:
Duverger's Law posits that FPTP leads to two-party dominance, as seen in the United States and the United Kingdom.
PR promotes multipartism by enabling smaller parties to win representation.
Example: The U.K. has two dominant parties (Labour and Conservatives), while the Netherlands has a fragmented system with many small parties represented in parliament.
Government Formation:
Plurality systems tend to produce single-party majority governments.
PR systems often result in coalition governments, where parties must negotiate to form a governing majority.
Example: Germany's Bundestag often requires coalitions, while the U.K. typically has single-party majorities.
Political Representation:
PR promotes descriptive representation by enabling minority groups to secure parliamentary seats.
Example: Women, ethnic minorities, and smaller ideological groups tend to have greater representation under PR systems.
Proportionality and Disproportionality
Disproportionality refers to the extent to which electoral outcomes diverge from proportional representation. It is more pronounced in plurality/majority systems than in PR systems. The Gallagher index measures disproportionality by calculating the deviation between the percentage of votes a party receives and its percentage of seats.
Case Study:
In Canada's 2011 election, the Conservative Party won 39.6% of the vote but 54% of the seats, a ""manufactured majority"" created by FPTP.
PR systems, like those in the Netherlands, avoid such dispr",Light Offloading,Heavy Offloading

"as a foreign policy analysis expert, explain this in a very detailed way do it in a discoursive way following the authors train,  do it in a discoursive way  and keep all the relevant in-text citations: In February 2011, in the midst of Japan's widely-criticized research whale hunt, the Japanese Agriculture Minister Michihiko Kano called the whaling fleet home months ahead of plan and hundreds short of its kill quota. The reason given for the abrupt end to the whaling season was harassment by a
nongovernmental organization (NGO) called the Sea Shepherd Conservation 2
Society (Sea Shepherds). For years, the Japanese fleet had taken pride in its ability to outrun environmental activists,3 and Japan had refused to put an end to its research whaling operations in the face of resolutions from the International Whaling Commission (IWC)4 and repeated cessation requests. Ultimately, it was confrontation instigated by a renegade group, rather than any international resolution or NGO pressure, that brought an abrupt end to Japan's controversial whaling practices.
In recent years, the NGO community has played an increasingly important and well-recognized role in shaping international law and in focusing enforcement resources. As a result, NGOs have earned invitations as official delegates to several major international conventions, particularly those addressing the environment.5 Moreover, news of the abrupt end of the Japanese whaling season demonstrates that environmental NGOs now have the ability to compel compliance with international commitments through unilateral action.
According to the Sea Shepherds as well as popular literature, this forced compliance is nothing more than private ""enforcement"" of international law.6 However, this assessment is too simplistic; a more nuanced theory of the principal functions of international lawmaking, known as the ""New Haven School,""7 identifies seven distinct categories of actions: ""intelligence, promotion or recommendation, prescription, invocation, application, termination, [and] appraisal.8"" Examining NGO activism through this paradigm is particularly useful for a number of reasons. First, the theory's well- defined, function-based stages better describe the effects of activism than simple, conventional designations that rely on the identity of the actors or the forum. Indeed, NGO activism can be understood as carrying out four of the seven aforementioned functions: promotion, prescription, invocation, or application.9 In addition to this descriptive advantage, the legal realist philosophical underpinnings of the New Haven School make it a natural fit for describing the unorthodox, but increasingly legitimate, role of NGOs in the international legal system. Finally, the longevity and prominence of the New Haven School provide a credible, well-understood framework to facilitate continued scholarly debate.
This Comment will use the anti-whaling campaigns in the Southern Oceanlo as a case study to analyze two competing models of NGO activism. The Comment defines the two competing models as ""protest"" and ""interventionist"" activism."" This Comment will show that the lawmaking function of activism and the effect it has on international behavioral norms change depending on the model employed. It concludes that, despite serious drawbacks, there are certain circumstances under which NGOs should adopt more interventionist activism to enforce international environmental law.
In the Southern Ocean, two types of environmental campaigns have targeted the whaling industry. One approach, employed by Greenpeace,12 utilizes consumer boycotts and protests to encourage divestment from the industry. The other approach, taken by the Sea Shepherds, uses a fleet of ships to directly intervene in and obstruct whaling operations in the Southern Ocean.' 3
Greenpeace's approach exemplifies protest activism, which consists of publicly organized, undoubtedly legal activities meant to put indirect pressure on the governmental or private entities that are purportedly violating
international law. This is a law-promotingor perhaps law-prescribingfunction; it aspires to shift public policy and community expectations. The Sea Shepherds' approach, in contrast, exemplifies interventionist activism, a model that involves either borderline- or blatantly illegal tactics to confront violators directly. Interventionist action generally includes law invocation and direct applicationof force to implement existing laws and policies. Contrasting the effectiveness and legality of these distinct approaches to anti-whaling activism will inform the international community's important and inevitable determination of the role of NGOs in international law enforcement. This Comment is divided into four parts. Part I will describe the problem presented by international whaling and provide a historical context of the industry, its relatively recent regulation, and specific actions concerning Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean. Parts II and III will draw on this case study to illustrate the competing models of activism-protest and interventionist-and highlight the demonstrated advantages of and drawbacks to each. Part IV will lend insight into the implications of permitting each
model.
II. HISTORY OF WHALING REGULATION AND INEFFECTIVE FORMAL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS
The Japanese have been eating whale meat and using whale products for more than two thousand years. 14 Whales were generally regarded as a natural resource that could be exploited freely by any person with the ability to hunt and kill them; they were a part of the common heritage of mankind that was the sea.15 In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, demand for whale meat, baleen, bones, blubber, and oil grew. Consequently, the commercial whaling industry blossomed in the fishing hubs of Scandinavia, Russia, Japan, and certain areas of the United States.' 6
Whaling continued into the twentieth century, and despite a worldwide decline in the industry, the advent of efficient tracking and hunting technologies brought several whale species to the brink of extinction by mid- century.17 This prompted the whale hunters to realize their industry's survival depended on maintaining healthy whale stocks through managed conservation rather than unrestrained exploitation.' 8 In response, the whaling nations gathered and analyzed relevant data to support the case for new regulatory policy and to educate the public. These early efforts to diagnose the danger of extinction served the New Haven School's intelligence function.19 Similarly, the advocacy on the part of the whale hunters and their national governments marked the beginning of the law promotion stage.20 These efforts resulted in the formation of the first authoritative international commitments on whaling.
In the face of strong scientific evidence and even stronger appeals to the public conscience, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) served the prescriptionfunction by explicitly laying out the points of international consensus on the regulation of whaling.2 1 The ICRW was drafted in 1946 with fifteen state parties and has subsequently been amended. It now has eighty-nine state parties and remains the chief international legal document governing the whaling practices of participating nations. For the purposes of this case study regarding Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean, Article VIII and the Schedule of the ICRW provide the relevant legal prescriptions. As of 1986, the ICRW has included in the Schedule a ban on commercial whaling of any type,22 setting and maintaining annual catch limits of zero in all regions for all types of whales.23 Despite initially objecting to the moratorium, Japan has since withdrawn its objection and has maintained that it is in compliance with the ICRW. In addition to the general obligations of the moratorium, the IWC established in 1994 a whale sanctuary in the Southern Ocean, specifically
forbidding commercial whaling in that area.24 Japan objected to the sanctuary's
25
creation with respect only to Antarctic minke whale stocks.
Japan has conducted whaling operations in the Southern Ocean after 1986
under the auspices of the ""scientific research"" or ""special permit"" exception
26
Article VIII provides in part that ""any Contracting Government may grant to any of its nationals a special permit authorizing that national to kill, take and treat whales for purposes of scientific research . . . and the killing, taking, and treating of whales in accordance with
the provisions of this Article shall be exempt from the operation of this Convention.""27 Article VIII further allows the whales taken under this exception to be processed and sold on the commercial market pursuant to the instructions of the country granting the research permit.28
Although Japan has steadfastly asserted the legality of its whaling operations under the special permit system, many other IWC nations regard its operations as violating the ICRW.29 Even if Japan's whaling activity falls under the Article VIII exception, based on the government's statements, the customary international law principle of pacta sunt servanda, codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, requires that Japan perform its treaty obligations in ""good faith.""30
Japan's programs (JARPA I and 11)31 do not plausibly serve ""purposes of scientific research"" within the meaning of Article VIII of ICRW. Although the JARPA program has been in effect since the initial imposition of the moratorium, Japan has produced very few, if any, peer-reviewed studies explaining the program's scientific findings. 32 The IWC Scientific Committee, commenting on Japan's studies in the North Pacific in 2000 (then called JARPN, rather than JARPA), has said that the Japanese research ""did not address questions of high priority relevant to management, did not make full use of existing data, and revealed many methodological problems.""33 Japan, along with some international commentators, maintains that it need not provide any scientific studies at all showing the results of its research in order to justify classification as a ""research"" program. 34 A majority of the IWC nations have made clear through repeated resolutions3 5 that the permits granted by Japan in the JARPA I and II programs were beyond the scope of the Article VIII scientific research exception, or, at least, constituted a bad faith use of the exception.36 The aforementioned ""good faith"" obligation requires that even if Japan's self-proclaimed ""research"" classification controls textually, the Article VIII exception still cannot be abused in this way.
Formal international law enforcement mechanisms, such as resolutions, have been ineffectual in ending Japan's illegal whaling in the Southern Ocean. Lacking the necessary invocation and application functions of international lawmaking, the ICRW and domestic law prescriptions have had no lasting effect on community behavior.37 Japan has been authorizing whaling through the JARPA programs continuously since 1986. It has taken over twenty years of Japanese disregard for IWC recommendations for the Australian government-joined by twenty-nine other nations and the European Commission-to file in 2010 an Application Instituting Proceedings in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). 39 Nonetheless, even if the ICJ rules in favor of Australia, which is by no means certain,40 that still may not affect the Japanese whale hunt.41 This effort is too little, too late; it pales in comparison to the effect that both protest and interventionist forms of activism have had on the Japanese whaling industry.
III. PROTEST ACTIVISM
In contrast to the ineffectiveness of formal enforcement mechanisms such as resolutions, even the protest model of informal activist pressure has had a substantial effect on Japan's whaling industry. As described at the outset, protest activism involves entirely legal, coordinated efforts by NGOs and members of the general public. This type of opposition to Japanese whaling includes typical protestor tactics: consumer boycotts, public demonstrations, and awareness campaigns. When these organizations perform protest activism and engage in political discussions, or even act as behavioral coordinating devices for individual consumers exercising their right to choose among a range of product offerings, they engage in law promotion or prescription.42 Boycotts, demonstrations, and campaigns are generally permissible under international law,43 even when coordinated by NGOs.4 The work of Greenpeace in protesting Japanese whaling activity in the Pacific Ocean best exemplifies the protest activism model, shedding light on its usefulness and limits. In 2005, an Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) report revealed that Nippon Suisan Kaisha Ltd. of Japan (Nissui), the parent company of the famous Gorton's, held a 31.9 percent interest in Kyodo Senpaku, one of the companies whaling under the Japanese special permits.45 In response, Greenpeace, in collaboration with EIA and the Humane Society of the United States, called for consumer pressure on Gorton's via an e-mail and letter writing campaign, and advocated for a wholesale boycott.46 The Earth Island Institute organized a parallel boycott campaign against the New Zealand company Sealord, which is also a subsidiary of Nissui.4 7 Protest tactics like these generally do not implicate domestic legal restrictions in the countries of origin for NGOs, the countries of the individual activists, or the targeted countries. Many of the NGOs that coordinate consumer boycotts and other protest tactics, like Greenpeace, EIA, and the Humane Society, are based in the United States or the European Union. In the United States, it is unconstitutional for any state to prohibit peaceful consumer boycotts;48 the U.S. Constitution protects the freedom of assembly, which encompasses peaceful public demonstration. 49 Other countries, including Japan, similarly protect organized consumer behavior.50 The generally lawful nature ofprotest activism in both domestic and international contexts is perhaps its greatest advantage when compared to the more extreme, but also more effective, interventionist activism model.
Less than six months after Greenpeace initiated its campaign and in response to mounting consumer pressure, Nissui divested completely from Kyodo Senpaku, donating its shares to ""public interest"" corporations.51 Greenpeace and other NGOs claimed victory, but acknowledged that the divestiture would not put an end to the illegal whaling.52
Although Greenpeace and others managed to reduce availability of financing for the industry, the Japanese whale hunt continued. The shares Nissui divested were ultimately acquired by the Japanese government, which now very heavily subsidizes the whaling operations under JARPA I.53 This outcome suggests that protest activism, though it serves law promotion and prescriptionfunctions, ultimately lacks sufficient force to effectively change behavior.
IV. INTERVENTIONIST ACTIVISM
As its moniker suggests, interventionist activism is decidedly more powerful and consequently more effective than its protest counterpart. The Sea Shepherds' active harassment of the Japanese whaling fleet in the Southern Ocean brought an early end to the 2011 whaling season.54 Nonetheless, such controversial practices come with a price. Because many interventionist tactics themselves violate international law, their continued use threatens to compromise the international rule of law. Ultimately, the global community must decide whether the costs of such repeated violations to the international
legal regime are outweighed by the successes of interventionist activists. If global acquiescence towards the Sea Shepherds' campaign to date is any indication, interventionist activism provides an acceptable, albeit imperfect, solution-at least with respect to the enforcement of environmental obligations.
Interventionist activism has been markedly more successful than protest activism in reducing the number of whales taken illegally. A simple call to action will generally lead to under-enforcement where international law violations have environmental casualties-such as the whales of the Southern Ocean-rather than human victims. Without staunch and forceful human defenders, these animals have little chance of receiving the amount of protection they are due under international law. The interventionist tactics of the Sea Shepherds, led by Captain Paul Watson, aim to correct this problem of under-protection. The Sea Shepherds, made famous by the Discovery television program Whale Wars, have harassed Japanese whalers by ramming their vessels,55 throwing bottles of foul-smelling butyric acid onto their vessels, temporarily blinding whalers with a laser device,57 deploying propeller fouling devices to disable vessels,58 and even boarding moving whaling vesselS.59 Interventionist techniques such as these involve direct, often violent, confrontations between NGOs, like the Sea Shepherds, and alleged violators of
international law-in this instance, the Japanese whalers.60 Watson and the Sea
Shepherds justify their questionable tactics as necessary for the enforcement of
international law, relying primarily on a combination of the ICRW and the
World Charter for Nature.61 Rather than promoting a certain policy or
attempting to shift community expectations, this type of interventionist
activism explicitly invokes and applies prescriptions already found in
international legal agreements.62 Interventionist activists serve the New Haven
School's invocation function when they choose the specific targets of their
campaigns; interventionist NGOs specifically mark certain Japanese actors as
violators oftheir international legal commitments.63 When the activists engage
their targets in this manner, they then serve the application function, because
they pass final judgment on the offenders and attempt to use force to curb the
64 illegal action.
Although the results in the Southern Ocean demonstrate that interventionist activism, in this context, is effective in terms of changing the behavior of international actors, the actions of the Sea Shepherds are likely illegal under international law because they constitute piracy, terrorism, or both. Article 101 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) defines piracy as ""any illegal acts of violence ... committed for private ends by the crew . .. of a private ship . . . and directed on the high seas, against another ship . . . or against persons or property on board such ship ... .""65 The Belgian case of Castle John and Nederlandse Stichting Sirius v. NV Mabeco and NV Parfin66 held because their motivation was the achievement of the NGO's goals, the seafaring environmentalists acted for ""private ends,"" and were therefore subject to the UNCLOS piracy laws.67 Although this precedent suggests that anti-whaling interventionist activism constitutes piracy, it has not been given much weight and remains the only decision in which environmentalists were held to be pirates within the meaning of UNCLOS .
Even if the interventionist tactics of the Sea Shepherds in the Southern Ocean do not constitute piracy under UNCLOS, they almost certainly violate the United Nations Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation (SUA). This Convention provides that ""any person commits an offence if that person unlawfully and intentionally . . . performs an act of violence against a person on board a ship if that act is likely to endanger the safe navigation of that ship . . . ."" The Japanese government, 70 as well as certain commentators, have deemed activity in violation of this provision ""marine terror[ism].""n
As previously mentioned, Watson defends his actions by invoking the World Charter for Nature, which he contends allows private citizens to take direct enforcement action to ""[s]afeguard and conserve nature in areas beyond national jurisdiction.""72 The World Charter for Nature, however, makes no
mention of enforcement, direct action, or penalties, much less empowering nonstate actors to carry out these objectives. Furthermore, U.N. resolutions have less legal effect than the multi-national conventions UNCLOS and SUA, which condemn the Sea Shepherds' tactics. Because of this shaky legal footing,
most international legal scholars believe that the Sea Shepherds lack the authority to engage in the tactics of interventionist activism, even under the auspices of a citizen's arrest.7 3
Despite, or perhaps as a result of, the illegality of the Sea Shepherds' actions, interventionist activism has proven most effective in ending illegal Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean. As discussed earlier, the decision by the Japanese government to recall the whaling fleet in February of 2011 reflects the success of the Sea Shepherds' tactics.74 More broadly, the effects of the Sea Shepherds' brash actions have been felt in Japan, where many believe whaling will soon be banned.75
The general reluctance of any nation to prosecute the Sea Shepherds for violations of international law suggests that the benefit of interventionist activism outweighs its costs in this case.7 6 The most notable example of the international community's acquiescence is Australia's steadfast refusal to prosecute any Sea Shepherds crewmember despite the Japanese government's numerous pleas and formal protests regarding Australia's inaction.77 Polling suggests that a majority of the Australian public does not believe the Australian government has done enough to end Japanese whaling and also does not find fault with the Sea Shepherds for the collisions that have occurred between their boat and Japanese whaling vessels.78
In the United States, the success of the television program Whale Wars, now in its fourth season, suggests that the public community is at the very least fascinated with the Sea Shepherds' campaign, although there has been no significant public outcry to stop them. Indeed, the U.S. government has not taken any formal legal action against the organization, which has its headquarters in Friday Harbor, Washington, despite pleas from the Japanese that the organization's 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status be revoked.79 It is quite possible that the global community, at least as evidenced by citizen and government action in Australia and the United States, recognizes that by giving real force to international law, the Sea Shepherds and other interventionist activist organizations are performing the costly, and often unfunded, invocation and applicationfunctions arising from obligations to international conventions. By allowing interventionist activism to continue, either by explicitly recognizing its legitimacy or by refraining from condemning the activists' illegal tactics, countries utilize private funding to monitor and enforce conservation laws, thus saving themselves considerable amounts of tax money and government resources.so
Nonetheless, the counterargument goes, interventionist activism suffers from the ethical fallacy that ""two wrongs do not make a right,"" and thus its existence undercuts the international rule of law. The legitimacy of the international legal regime at its core depends on the ability of nations to make reciprocal commitments, trusting that such agreements will be upheld, an idea best expressed in the cardinal maxim of international law, pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept). If enough actors can ignore binding legal commitments without consequence, then the principle at the foundation of the international legal system may be compromised beyond repair. Cooperative international legal efforts could become increasingly rare, or at the very least much more difficult to undertake, due to a lack of trust. From this perspective, to the extent that the larger goal of international law is to establish a world order that can regulate the global commons, equivocation as to interventionist activism may be a step in the wrong direction.
This counterargument, though theoretically appealing, ignores the reality of the situation in many circumstances in which international laws are significantly under-enforced, such as the case of whaling in the Southern Ocean. In keeping with the legal realist approach of the New Haven School, interventionist activism should be supported and permitted to continue if for no other reason than that it is the best possible actualization of the international community's environmental commitments. Interventionist activism has helped to stop a practice in commercial whaling that the global community has long condemned but that formal legal disapprobation has done nothing to curb. From a legal realist perspective, there can be no better endorsement for a policy. Furthermore, as the illegal interventionist tactics employed in anti-whaling campaigns have been insufficiently threatening to provoke backlash from the greater international community, they do not appear to pose any real risk to the public world order.
V. CONCLUSION
As the events in the Southern Ocean demonstrate, nonstate actors can and do use informal pressure to perform international lawmaking functions, often with greater success than state actors working through traditional channels. The difficult question is not whether activism in general benefits the international legal order, but whether its protest or interventionist form presents a better framework for NGOs and the international community at large.
The legal tactics and limited success of protest activism probably will persist without much opposition, given that the model is a valuable substitute to organized formal actions that also serve promotion andprescriptionfunctions. However, the international community will have to confront the implications of interventionist activism, particularly given that its recent success in the Southern Ocean will likely inspire other NGOs to employ similar tactics. The current strategy of turning a blind eye will not be viable for much longer. Even if interventionist activism fills a void with respect to law invocation and application functions, which are underserved by formal processes, the international community will ultimately have to decide whether the enforcement benefits are significant enough to merit allowing this activity to continue to undercut the rule of law.
The events in the Southem Ocean demonstrate the strong potential of the interventionist activism model in the environmental context, particularly since the primary victims in such cases have no seat at the international bargaining table. What then, should the international community make of interventionist tactics employed outside the environmental movement? If these tactics become part of the arsenal of radical human rights organizations, the global community should, and likely will, treat their use much differently. NGOs taking direct, abrasive action in defense of people's rights could resemble rebellion rather than activism. Such situations could even result in armed conflict, given that the United Nations Charter takes a firm line against ""aggression.""8 1 Furthermore, the rule-of-law costs could become more significant as interventionist tactics spread. Though such extreme outcomes may never come to pass, movement further along the spectrum and away from respect for the rule of law could incrementally undermine the foundation of international trust. For these reasons, in order to remain an effective tool, interventionist activism should be employed sparingly by social movements and aimed only at those causes with truly silent and undervalued victims.",Not Offloading,Not Offloading

"summarize how to reduce agency slag: 

 What happens if voters find out that their politicians are corrupt? Will they
re-elect them? Will they punish them and vote for someone else? That’s a
question two economists, Ferraz and Finan, investigated in a study in Brazil.
240
Chapter 14: Elections and political accountability
Brazil is a great place to study corruption – not only because there is a lot
of corruption but also because there used to be an anti-corruption program
in which some municipalities were randomly assigned to an audit.
Brazil is a highly decentralised country. Local governments receive funds
from the government for education, health, transportation and local
infrastructure. But the money does not always get there. Ferraz and Finan
looked at three types of corruption:
• Over-invoicing of goods and services – that is, mayors
pretending they spent more on an item than they actually did.
• Diversion of public funds for private gain – for instance,
mayors might use funds that were intended for education and health
projects to buy cars, apartments or other things.
Fraud in the procurement of public goods and services. Here
is an example: ‘In 2002 and 2003, the federal government transferred to
Itapetinga $110,000 for the purchase of school lunches. In 12 out of the 16
calls for bids, only one bid was ever supplied. It was later discovered that
each call for bids was posted only one hour prior to its deadline, and, not
surprisingly, only a firm owned by the mayor’s brother posted within the
time limit.’ (Ferraz and Finan, 2011, p.1281).
In 2003, then President Lula da Silva started an anti-corruption program,
randomly selecting a few dozen municipalities. Auditors would then be
sent to the selected municipalities to have an in-depth look at all the
accounts and documents, to inspect the existence and quality of public
work construction and delivery of public services, and to meet locals to
hear their complaints. After 10 days they would wrap up and write a report.
A summary of the main findings would be posted on the internet and
disclosed to radio stations, the central source of information in rural Brazil.
Ferraz and Finan took advantage of the random timing of these audits.
Because the timing of the audits was determined by the flip of a coin some
mayors were audited just before an election and some were audited just
after. That allows us to see if voters would punish mayors if, just before an
election, they found that they were corrupt.
The results showed that corruption is higher when politicians
have a limited term. The possibility for re-election results in a roughly
20% decrease in corruption relative to when the politician has a limited
term. This illustrates how electoral competition can strengthen the
ability of voters to sanction politicians and thereby improve politician
performance and limit shirking.
The study also found that when voters have access to newspapers
and the radio, and can therefore learn about instances of
corruption, politicians are less corrupt. Transparency reduced
corruption for both first term and second term mayors. This suggests that
selection is also important for improving politician performance: when
voters can learn more about politicians’ qualifications prior to elections,
they are able to select politicians with a lower tendency to engage in
corruption.",Light Offloading,Light Offloading

"Chapter 9 – entry strategies, alliances and evolution
FDI: company directly invests in facilities to produce and/or market their goods in foreign country; MNE: multinational enterprise: company undertaking FDI <-> SME: small/medium
Before entering new market, 4 questions:
1.)   Why enter foreign market?: to expand sales revenue; Peng and Meyer (2019): suggest that investments in foreign markets should have at least one of four common objectives: natural resource-seeking, market-seeking, efficiency-seeking, innovation-seeking
 
2.)   Which markets to enter?: depends on company’s objectives;
v market-seeking company: looks at size of market, present and future purchasing power of consumers there and level of domestic & foreign competition
v natural resource-seeking: seek quantity, quality, low-cost LABOUR resources -> ex.: companys looking for oil deposits
v efficiency-seeking: TOTAL low-cost, productive and reliable local workforces -> ex.: software developers in India
 
3.)   When to enter?: entering before competitors can give first mover advantage
è take over rivals by establishing strong brand name, building up sales volume and experience and then gaining cost adv., creating switching costs and then tying customers to products; you get the best location (esp. for fast food)
è disadvantages first mover: risks and costs of business failure, inexperience leading to major mistakes, pioneering costs, new environment is too different leading to major time/effort/expenses incurring, costs of promoting new brand; no knowledge about customer preferences, you must educate the consumers
è Late mover adv.: taking advantage of first mover’s investments, learning about market, avoiding uncertainties, differentiating products more precisely;
before entering new market and committing, MNEs look at different ownership situations and control:
Ø  wholly owned greenfield site: starting entirely new business, to maintain control
Ø  full acquisition: buy existing business, better control, protection of know-how
Ø  newly created joint venture: with another business, less control and ownership -> sharing costs/risks/profits, gaining partner’s knowledge/assets/market presence
Ø  partical acquisition: of another business, less ownersh./control -> potential conflict with co-owners but gaining size/presence/existing know-how
‘born global business’: start business knowing they exclusively want to focus on foreign markets -> Spotify (2008); also known as ‘lean internationalisation’: running business primarily on information technology and the internet
six ways businesses can enter new markets:
1.)   exporting: producing domestically and selling abroad; PROS: avoids costs of establishing local logistics, helps firms achieve experience curve and location economies, in exporting country: expertise to help facilitate exports; very flexible in enterning and leaving new markets, low risks; CONS: missing out on lower-cost locations abroad, high transportation costs/tariffs, minimum control, maybe restrictions on amount of revenue growth that can be achieved,
 
2.)   Turnkey projects: foreign contractor agrees to handle every detail of the project for local client -> designing/ constructing new facility and giving client the keys once completed and ready for operation; mainly in pharmaceutical & chemical industries; ex.: Siemens
a.     build-operate-transfer model (as a variant of turnkey projects): contractor manages facility for fees after completed construction
PROS: less risky, earning economic returns
CONS: maybe small market growth, contractor may create local competitor that then overtakes market, selling your competitive advantage away (know-how,…)
3.)   Licensing: licensor grants rights to intangible property to the licensee for specific period for royalty fee paid by licensee -> patents, formulas, copyrights, trademarks; mainly used by manufacturing firms; Disney to clothing firms (H&M), Marvel
PROS: avoids costs and risks of opening up a new market, avoids barriers to investment, no additional marketing needed
CONS: no tight control over manufacturing/marketing strategy, lack of control over technology and intellectual property IP, potential loss of intangible assets
4.)   Franchising: specialised, long-term licensing; franchiser not only sells intangible property to franchisee but also insists on tight rules regarding how it does business; franchiser receives royalty payment (percentage of franchisee’s net revenue); mainly used by service companies -> MCDONALDS!!!!!!!!, Taco Bell
PROS: avoids costs and risks of opening up a new market, quickly buildable global presence
CONS: may hinder company’s ability to take profits out of one country to support in another, difficult to ensure equal quality of product, poor quality in one location might hurt brand globally -> ex.: travellers expect same quality of Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong as in New York
5.)   joint ventures JV: establish new company that is jointly owned by at least 2 independent companies, typically 50/50 owned by the partners; Starbucks with Barnes&Noble
PROS: benefit from partner’s knowledge of local circumst. (culture, language, politics), sharing costs and risks, often accepted by political institutions
CONS: less control of own assets, conflicts/battles for control between parties, power imbalances, difficult to coordinate globally
6.)   fully owned subsidiaries (Tochtergesellschaft): company owns 100% of shares in the subsidiary -> subsidiary located in foreign country that is entirely owned by parent multinational; Tesla in Shanghai
PROS: reduced risk of losing control, company gains all profits earned, protect key technologies and IP, lots of opportunity for creating global strategy, maximum control
CONS: company bears full risk and cost of setting up overseas, not flexible in entering/leaving foreign markets, high risk
additional decision within fully owned subsidiary route: either adopt a) or b)
a.)   greenfield: company builds subsidiary from ground up
PRO: build what it exactly needs, control over equity, protects IP
CONS: slower to establish, risk due to high capital investment needed
b.)   acquisition: buy existing company
PRO: quicker, take over competitors, no additional unnecessary new capacity, less risky, gain tangible (factories,…) and intangible assets (brand name, existing customer relationships, knowledge)
CONS: overpaying, high up-front capital needs, clash of cultures, inadequate pre-acquisition screening (to ensure you’re not paying to much)
Strategic alliances: SAs: collaborations between independent companies that decide to share resources to undertake specific/mutually beneficial project; form between actual or potential competitors; ex.: formal joint ventures, R&D joint ventures; to cooperate on particular strategic task
PROS: facilitates entry into foreign market, stepping-stone for full acquisition, sharing fixed costs and risks of developing new products, brings together complementory skills and assets
CONS: may give competitor you ally with a low-cost route and reducing your compet. adv., high failure rate
 
-       another form of SA: ‘operational collaboration’ -> collaboration in operations, marketing or distribution (ex.: airline companies form alliances to connect to all major travel destinations and also share flyer programmes and passenger lounges)
-       success of alliance: function of 1.) partner selection: effective partner helps company achieve strategic goals & doesn’t exploit alliance just for own ends; 2.) alliance structure: guard against partner opportunism, allow for swapping skills and technologies with equal gains; 3.) management capability: building strong interpersonal relationships between 2 managements -> learning from partner
 
foreign market entry is just the start of a long journey -> afterwards you need to pick right strategy (international, localisation, global standardisation, transnational => Ch. 7)
companies constantly need to adjust, adapt and make bigger commitments (through fully owned subsidiaries, large-scale joint ventures and large acquisitions)
 
Chapter 10 – international marketing and R&D strategy
Marketing= ‘’activity, set of institutions and processes for creating, communicating, delivering and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners and society at large’’ (AMA, 2007); there’s business to consumer marketing (companies create value for customers, build strong customer relationships), business-to-business marketing (creating value, solutions and relationships with another company), international marketing (marketing carried out overseas and across national broders) and company-level marketing;
Most important thing of a business is it’s paying customer -> Drucker said that marketing is seeing the business through the customer’s eyes
international marketing strategy must be consistent with company’s corporate and business level strategy; marketing strategy focuses on choices over products and markets -> Ansoff matrix suggests 4 strategic choices; how to grow your market:
1.)   market penetration strategy: selling more of your current product in your current market => Coca Cola in US, McDonalds opening more franchises in US -> least riskiest
2.)   market development strategy: selling existing products in new markets -> to extend life of their products and grow revenue/profits; may also envolve product development (new packaging); can either attract new users (new industries) or new locations/areas => McDonalds in India, Tesla with their cybertruck
3.)   product development strategy: new products in existing markets -> can be expensive/requires new strategic capabilities/involves project managem. Risks => Apple, Mercedes
4.)   diversification strategy: new products in new markets -> riskiest approach to internationalisation, Uber Boat in Croatia
 
Marketing mix: choices a company offers to its targeted market: 4 Ps
-> companies decide which P can be standardized and which needs to be adapted to local responsiveness -> companies should start with segmenting markets -> that is: identifying distinct groups of consumers (your target groups) with environmental variables such as geography, demography, socio-cultural factors and psychological factors (ex.: age, education, income, gender) or the CAGE framework (Willc.) and the 4 Ps
once you segmented your market (and know your target group), you adjust the marketing mix according to each segment -> but pay attention to the differences between countries in the segment and the existence of segments that transcend national borders -> a global strategy is possible if segments transcend national borders
you first segment your market, then evaluate and target and then position yourself
marketing across consumer life cycle: customer relationship management (CRM) is crucial for achieving continued sales -> want custommers to repurchase!; Willcocks shows 5 stages of attending to customer needs and building relationship with customers: awareness (what’s available; AIDA model (awareness,interest, desire, action), evaluation (how good is this product?), purchase (actually buying it), product and support experience (how does this feel?, here the actual customer life cycle begins, exceptional service), bonding (building a relationship, loyalty);
strong customer relationships: PROS: increasing purchases from same customers, customer recommends to potential customers (they become your brand ambassadors), allowing for premium pricing, easier selling of new products, meeting/exceeding expectations  4Ps:
1.)   product: bundle of attributes -> content (product’s superior performance and aesthetic physical features), aura (symbol of status), support aspects (expertise that surrounds luxury item), service personalisation -> what attributes do our customers want from our product? all of them? -> products sell when their attributes match consumer needs; in IB: consumer needs vary from country 2 country, so there has to be product differentiation due to:
a.)   cultural differences: tradition, language, religion, education -> Nestlé offers different menues depending on local preferences -> fish fingers in UK, coq au vin in France
b.)   level of economic development: companies in highly-developed countries incorporate performance features <-> less developed countries prefer basic products but want high reliability
c.)   product and technological standards: companies customise their marketing mix to meet national differences in product and technological standards
2.)   price: pricing relates to demand and competition in the industry; should prices be different in different markets even though it’s the same product? (=price discrimination) -> maximises profits -> only works when company keeps its national markets separate; can happen when price elasticities differ (elastic vs inelastic -> Tommy Hilfiger priced Jeans in Europe 3x higher than in US -> charging higher prices when demand is inelastic);ex: cars charged higher in Germany than in UK); there can also be strategic pricing: three aspects:
a.     predatory pricing: using profits earned in one country to support aggressive pricing in another market to drive out competitors and then once competition leaves, company raises the P -> ex: Matsushita; (can be illegal tho)
b.     multipoint pricing: company’s pricing strategy in one market may have impact on how rival prices products in another market; charging different prices in different markets for the same products;
c.     experience curve pricing: company sets low prices worldwide to quickly build sales volume -> willing to take a loss initially and in future (once moved down the experience curve) achieving cost advantage
but sometimes companies are regulated in terms of their pricing: through anti-dumping regulations (limits predatory pricing and experience curve pricing) or competition policy
3.)   promotion: includes TV, radio, print, online advertising, social media, direct mail, PR, billboards,… -> which of these is best for communicating with our target market?; there are limits to mass media, branding and standardised messaged and international communication -> cultural barriers (overcome by cross-cultural literacy, hiring local advertising agency,…), source and country-of-origin effects (source effects: occur when receiver of the message evaluates the message on the basis of the image of the sender; country-of-origin effects: extent to which the place of manufacturing influences a customer’s product evaluations -> BP changed name from British Petroleum after big success in USA), noise levels (number of other messages competing for potential customer’s attention -> higher in developed nations such as US, Germany)
when company chooses communication strategy it has to choose either:
a.)   push strategy: emphasis on personal selling; no media available, for industrial products, short distribution channels, Hermes
b.)   pull strategy: mass media advertising; for companies selling consumer goods to large market segments; long distribution channels, when there’s access to advertising media -> TV, newspaper, magazines; ex. Unilever
however, companies can use both strategies at the same time for their different markets -> ex.: pharmaceutical companies use both strategies -> in US pull, in Europe push
but sometimes companies don’t have a real choice (want to use media but not available)  
standardized advertising makes sense when: has significant economic advantages, minimum creative talent available, global brand name, no cultural differences, no regulations that would limit it; some companies standardize only some parts and customise the other parts
4.)   place: where product is provided, not nec. physical location (virtually -> movie downloads), companies can sell directly to consumers/retailers/…; distribution strategy: the means the company chooses for delivering the product to the consumer -> depends on company’s market entry strategy;
in IB: Hill (2021) points out that there are at least 4 main differences in distribution systems:
1.)   retail concentration: concentrated retail system (few retailers supply most of the market ->UK) or fragmented retail system (many retailers, no one of which has a major share of the market ->Japan)
2.)   channel length: number of intermediaries between producer and consumer -> short channel (producer sells directly to consumer; in concentrated systems (US)) or long channel (producer sells through important agent/wholesaler/retailer; in fragmented retail systems (Japan))
3.)   channel exclusivity: channels can be exclusive bec. retailers like to carry well-established brands rather than take chance on smth new -> companies have hard time breaking into new markets bec. they cannot access distribution system
4.)   channel equality: the expertise/competencies/skills of established reatilers in a country and their ability to sell/support foreign company’s products; channel quality better in developed countries -> Apple opening retail stores in UK
when P is important, choose shorter channel; when retail sector is very fragmented, choose long channel; when there’re concerns about channel equality, handle distribution on your own (like Apple)
 
R&D: new product ideas that come from the interactions of scientific research, demand conditions and competitive conditions; today competition is all about technological innovation and product life cycles are rather short; the importance of R&D got vividly demonstrated with the race to find a vaccine during COVID-19; to succeed R&D activity has to be aligned very closely with international business strategy; company has to ask itself where to place it’s R&D -> usually located in very few countries around the world -> in places where more money is spent on R&D and where demand for new products is strong and where costumers are wealthy and where competition is intense => USA after WW2 and nowadays also in Europe and Asia (Japan, China (esp. with artificial intelligence)); there’s been a stagnation in overall R&D intensity and a preference for performing R&D abroad -> today, successful companies see new product development opportunities in multiple locations; but a new product does NOT ensure success obv. -> only 10-20% succeed (high failure rate!) -> to succeed companies should form integrated strategy of R&D with marketing and production -> this integration ensures that customer needs drive product development, new products’re easily designed, development costs are kept in check, time to market is minimised; companies achieve this integration by developing a cross-functional team which is led by broadly-experienced and well-known managers who strive for the same goal, to commercialise new technologies successfully companies need to develop different versions for different countries (local responsiveness); to build successful global R&D companies have to ensure that R&D, marketing and production are integrated -> in IB this means that companies have to develop global network of R&D centres that are linked by formal and informal mechanisms (ex: Microsoft has R&D sites in multiple locations); companies often like to enter innovation hubs that cluster know-how/skills (silicon valley!!!), companies then have to protect their intellectual property (IP) that results from R&D by: placing R&D at home/in locations with strong protection, changing versions frequently, building complexity into product, maintain high security, support public policy initiatives to protect IP (all according to Willcocks);
   
Chapter 11 – organisation of international business
Organisation structure: formal division of the organisation into sub-units; location of decision-making responsibilities; structure: establishment of integrating mechanisms to coordinate activities of sub-units;
the more internationalised, the more coordination problems, the bigger the requirement for developing integrating mechanisms; managers must also be aware of need to fit environment to the strategy and to the structure; we want to locate decision making in the most effective place in the organisation -> not automatically senior manager who decides
Willcocks lists PROS for centralisation: facilitates coordination across countries and activities, ensures decisions are consistent with overall organisational objectives, gives top managers capability to introduce necessary changes on an international basis, avoids duplication of similar activities and then gaining scale (centralising R&D in one location around the globe instead of letting each region do their own R&D);
PROS for decentralised decision making: more commitment and motivation, greater degree of control, can produce better decisions , greater flexibility and responsiveness, quick decision-making;
four kinds of multinational strategy (Willcocks): international (home repl.), localisation, global standardisation, transnational strategy;
there’s a debate in IB whether strategy shapes structure or structure shapes what strategies are possible -> but overall, strategy and structure have to be closely aligned;
4 types of structure:
1.)   international division structure: for home replication strategy: set up when companies initially expand abroad -> CONS: foreign managers not given voice relative to heads of domestic divisions, lack of synergies -> not coordinated with rest of company, only little commitment from own managers => ex. Cardinal Health
2.)   geographic area structure: fits with localisation strategy: MNEs are organised according to specific geographic areas -> each area is self-contained/largely autonomous/ has own set of activities, supports local responsiveness => Mittal Steel until 2007
CONS: encourages fragmentation of organisation into highly autonomous entities -> power base built up in one area can be difficult to control and may resist change, difficult to transfer core competencies and skills between areas
3.)   global product division structure: fits with global standardisation strategy:  when you want your domestically successful product to sell overseas; => EADS ; each division is largely self-contained and autonomous with headquarter being responsible for overall strategic development and financial control of company; Why use this one?:  value-creation activities of each product division are coordinated by that specific division worldwide, is a solution when international division and geographic area structure doesn’t work, each division can develop scale and core competencies to achieve all economies; CON: lack of voice and power of country/domestic managers which leads to lack of local responsiveness
4.)   global matrix structure: fits with transnational strategy: for companies that have to simultaneously focus on realising location and experience curve effect economies -> delivers local responsiveness and internal transfer of core competencies and knowledge worldwide; has both product divisions and geographic areas represented; CONS: bureaucratic, clumsy, slow, conflicts and power struggles between areas and product divisions due to joint responsibility/diverging viewpoints, finger-pointing between parties when smth goes wrong
 
companies that internationalize tend to expand from an international division structure to
a.)   worldwide product divisional structure: for companies that are diversified: allows for worldwide coordination of value creation activities, realises location & experience curve economies, facilitates transfer of core competencies, but doesn’t allow for local responsiveness
b.)   worldwide area structure: companies with minimum diversification: divides world into autonomous geographic areas, facilitates local responsiveness, is consistent with localisation strategy
 
Stopford and Wells: Stopford-Wells framework: shows likely evolution of structure towards global matrix grid as company’s foreign product diversity increases along with its foreign sales -> since this theory was developed: IB changed dramatically in terms of dynamism, size, new players and competitiveness; 4 organisation structures rarely found today in their pure forms; coordination and integration are key to globally operating companies; Nestlé -> responded really well to modern IB environment (uses decentralised organisational model -> implements differentiation and low-cost leadership strategies); new forms of organisational structure emerge as needs/requirements change -> always adjust!;
MNEs often use contingency theory: different organisations are designed to fit different specific circumstances -> MNEs continually have to search for better ways of accessing/utilising all their scarce resources
When companies go global, they develop additional complexity and coordination problems get even greater.
MNEs have sub-units, each with their own orientations/ways of working/goals.
a.)   Formal mechanisms for integrating sub-units: direct contact between unit managers, forming cross-unit temporary teams to develop communication/coordination
b.)   Informal integrating mechanisms: when formal mechanisms are not enough;
 
Knowledge management: structures/processes/systems that develop/transfer knowledge   -> knowledge is not just factual information but also know-how and know-why
Knowledge has 2 dimensions: explicit (can be written down/stored/transfered) or tacit (personal)
Knowledge management challenge in IB is to organise formal systems that deal with knowledge (databases, IP) and also create learning mechanisms for sharing tacit knowledge (Zoom meetings, social media)
Organisations experience difficulties in getting sub-units to share their knowledge, bec. knowledge is power -> to counter this, companies must develop sharing, collaborative culture and offer incentives for sharing
 
Organisational architecture: Willcocks: is the totality of a company’s organisation including:
1.)   Organisational structure: formal division of organisation into sub-units, deciding location of decision-making responsibilities (centralised vs decentr.), establishment of integrating mechanisms to coordinate activities of sub-units
2.)   Control systems and incentives: to measure performance of sub-units/managers/employees in terms of bureaucracy/output/culture, incentives used to reward them for their ideal behaviour
3.)   Processes: manner in which decisions are made and work is performed -> processes for formulating strategy/allocating resources/handling customer enquiries/…; either: core processes (on which mission and competitive advantage rely) or support processes (still necessary but do not differentiate product)
4.)   Organisational culture: norms and value systems that are shared among employees
5.)   People: employees
 
Superior company profitability requires: different elements of company’s organisational architecture to be internally consistent, organisational arch. must fit company’s strategy, strategy & architecture must fit with competitive conditions prevailing in their markets

"what are the 3 points here: Once authority has been given to courts, policy drift occurs as a result of
a number of factors. The judiciary tend to be from a certain social and
ethnic background and not always representative of the population as a
whole. This means that their preferences may be different to that of the
median voter or median politician. For example, of the 12 Supreme Court
Justices sitting on the UK Supreme Court in 2011, all were from white
backgrounds, only one was a woman, and only one did not go to Oxford
or Cambridge University. Griffith (1977) argued that this questioned
the neutrality of the judiciary as arbiters and instead it highlighted
their distinct policy preferences. More recently, others have questioned
the neutrality of the judiciary by claiming they are overly liberal with
a stronger focus on individual rights compared to politicians. This is
attributed to the nature of legal training which emphasises the role of the
law as a protector of individuals. We will see evidence of this in our case
study on euthanasia law from the Netherlands. Finally, others have argued
that it is not actually the preferences of judges that count, but rather it is
the fact that the wealthy have been able to gain greater access to the
courts to define legislation in their interest and this has led to policy drift",Light Offloading,Heavy Offloading

3. Research Findings
Secondary Research
Work-Centric Cultures:
Societal norms prioritising productivity discourage individuals from engaging in activities perceived as unproductive, such as pursuing interests outside their professional domains (Bellezza et al., 2017).
Specialisation vs. Creativity:
Excessive specialisation in work environments hampers mental agility and innovation. Studies suggest interdisciplinary collaboration can significantly enhance creative problem-solving (Scott E. Page, 2007).
Personal rewards
Personal enrichment (e.g., cherished experiences)
Self-actualization, or self-development (i.e., developing skills, abilities, knowledge)
Self-expression (i.e., expressing skills, abilities, knowledge already developed)
Self-image (i.e., known to others as the person who created the project, or in the case of a group effort, participated in the group)
Self-gratification (i.e., combination of superficial enjoyment and deep satisfaction)
Re-creation, or regeneration, of oneself through project-based leisure after a stint of work
Financial return from the project
Social rewards
Social attraction (e.g., associating with other participants in the project, with clients as a volunteer; participating in the social world of the activity)
Group accomplishment (e.g., group effort in accomplishing a project; senses of helping, being needed, being altruistic)
Contribution to the maintenance and development of the group (e.g., senses of helping, of being needed, of being altruistic in making the contribution)

STEBBINS, R. A. (2005). Project‐based leisure: theoretical neglect of a common use of free time. Leisure Studies, 24(1), 1–11
Interdisciplinary Benefits:
Cross-silo and multidisciplinary discussions and exchanges promote mental agility and help to develop creative problem-solving skills.


For instance, it has been proven that teams composed of workers from different academic backgrounds generate more successful projects (Basdogan and Morrone 2021, with the Idea Garden space).
At the company scale, we can cite the benefits of the SOS model, which advocates for the breaking down of silos within organisations. By pairing aleatory employees for conversations they encourage cross-department interactions and break routine mindsets.
Primary Research
(Qualitative) Expert Interviews
Hans Rusinek
- Divide between hands-on workers and “abstract” workers (could also be applied to blue-collar / white-colar workers or people / text workers)
- The current (traditional) work structure emphasises specialisation
- Lack of communication in companies builds silos, which harm the company’s efficiency => companies should have an interest in promoting cross-silo communication
- companies keep employees “functionally stupid” (meaning they don’t provide opportunities of personal development / enrichment)

Cristian Briceag (My Polis)
When discussing serious academic topics with people that already work a full-time job, use an interactive, “gamified” approach to maximise engagement
 
(Qualitative) User Interviews
1. All of the interviewed workers see the benefits of increased engagement with topics outside of their “professional comfort zone” as well as increased discussion with workers from other sectors and specialisations. This is both on a professional and personal level:
Professional level: they feel that this would increase their mental agility and creativity in problem-solving
Personal level: 

2. There is a willingness to engage more frequently with new topics and perspectives

3. For such engagements, all interviewed workers prefer a in person meeting, as opposed to an online meeting or “chat”/digital correspondence format 

4. Most people would take such an opportunity but:
Lack the time
Are unaware of possibilities to engage in such opportunities

5. All interviewees have to some extent previously engaged in opportunities for cross-silo discussions, but not on a regular basis (once a month or less)

6. Some workers state that they have no connection to professionals from other fields 

7. Some interviewees do regularly connect with professionals from other sectors. However, these are related sectors nonetheless, and the interviewees mainly discuss topics related to their own field of work (e.g. a photographer might meet with a manager, but only to discuss work related topics such as an upcoming event they may be planning). 

8. Full-time workers have a busy schedule but will take time for such engagements if:
These are planned in advance (aka previous notice is given in order to allow for scheduling)
They are slightly more leisurely, “laid-back” than their work - while keeping a minimum level of formality


(Quantitative) Survey Data:
Goal of the survey: 
We want to find out if our assumptions stand up…
93,5% of people surveyed feel comfortable discussing with someone opposing there views 
63% of respondents feel that there outside-of-work interests are being neglected
75.9% of which experience this due to time constraints.
76.1% are interested in meeting people with different beliefs, but 23.9% haven’t had such conversations in over a month.

There is a willingness to participate more often in activities outside of their comfort zone and to meet people with different views/perspectives:  
77,3% of surveyed people would be interest in meeting more people with different beliefs
97.6% of surveyed people would engage in conversation with other individuals if given the opportunity
88.6% of surveyed people are more likely to participate in a new hobby when given the opportunity.

Insight Statements
Intellectual curiosity and multidisciplinarity are undervalued in modern work environments, discouraging exploration of diverse topics and perspectives.
Lack of exchange and communication between professionals from different sectors limits creative problem-solving, leading to suboptimal solutions
People recognise the value of diverse interactions but face logistical and systemic barriers to pursuing them
Even if workers are in contact with workers from other sectors, there seems to be a barrier to actually have inspiring discussions about topics outside of their professional comfort zone		
->its not about meeting workers from other industries, it's about having conversations about new topics
That brings us to needs:
	-Workers need more opportunity for  

4. Proposed Solution(s)
As we know from our Qualitative interviews, workers want in person events to have inspiring discussions outside of their professional comfort zone. We interpreted that there has to be a barrier that there dont have intellectual discussions, so we have to foster them! 

Key Stakeholders
Corporates: Interested in improving employee creativity and cross-department collaboration.
Individuals: Full-time professionals seeking intellectual stimulation and networking opportunities.
Cultural Institutions (e.g., Junta da Freguesia): Align with their mission to foster public engagement and curiosity.

Expected Impact
Creativity and Innovation:
Diverse interactions stimulate novel ideas, enhancing problem-solving and innovation.
Personal Fulfillment:
Opportunities to explore new interests improve mental well-being and reduce burnout.
Social Cohesion:
Increased dialogue across sectors promotes understanding, tolerance, and societal harmony.

Principle 1: Politics Comes First Analytically
The first theoretical principle claims that the role of the social media in collective

action cannot be understood without first taking into account the political environ-
ment in which these media operate. The first way to demonstrate this principle is by

looking at the simple correlation between the level of social media penetration and the
amount of protest in the various countries. The reason for starting with this analysis
is to show what happens when political variables are omitted. It was also suggested
that if the principle of cumulative inequality is accurate, we would expect to find a
negative correlation between the penetration of social media and protest. This is
exactly what we see in Figure 1.
These findings should put to rest the suggestion that social media penetration
should be seen as cause for political protest (as claimed, for example, in Howard et al.
2011).14 Social media skeptics might even see these findings as “proof” of what
Morozov (2011) has called authoritarian deliberation. These skeptics would say that
this negative correlation shows that allowing people to express themselves in social
media reduces their need and/or motivation to take to the streets. A more likely and

convincing explanation emerges when one takes a step back and examines the differ-
ences in the various political environments (see Figure 2).

The left-hand side of Figure 2 provides strong evidence for the principle of cumula-
tive inequality. In those countries in which citizens suffer the greatest hardships, the

citizens also have less access to the Internet (data not shown) and social media, as
represented by the penetration of Facebook. These are the same societies in which the
traditional media are most closely controlled, which means that these are the citizens
who have the greatest need for alternative channels of communication.

The right-hand side of Figure 2 shows that the higher the level of political griev-
ances, the higher the level of protest. The four political factors are the level of disre-
spect for human rights, the extent to which the various countries have control over

corruption, the per-capita GDP of each country, and the level of democracy. With the
exception of the democracy index, the correlations are again quite strong: The more
difficult the political environment is in a country, the higher the protest index.
Admittedly, there is nothing very surprising about these results, which reinforce the

findings from other studies. However, the results are included as a reminder that it is a
mistake to omit political variables from such analyses.
Again, it is important to stress that these cross-country findings do not contradict
claims that social media were important tools for helping Arab protesters. One cannot
draw conclusions about individual- or group-level differences based on country-level
comparisons; this is what is referred to as an “ecological fallacy” (Freedman 2004).
Looking at the changes over time in each of these countries would probably reveal
that many groups found it much easier to protest after the advent of the Internet and
social media.
Principle 2: Political Events Precede Social Media Use
The second principle states that a significant increase in the use of the new media is
much more likely to follow a significant amount of protest activity than to precede it.
The fact that an increase in the availability of social media does not necessarily lead
to protest should be clear from the negative correlation between the amount of media
penetration and the number of protests.
As discussed, we used three different proxies to test this proposition. The first
looked at the correlations between the outbreak of protests and the rate of Facebook
registrations before and after the eruption of violence. The second involves looking at

the changes in the share of Google searches for “Facebook.” The third and final exami-
nation of Principle 2 was based on an examination of the most frequent keyword

searches in Google during different historical periods.

Starting with the rate of Facebook registrations, we looked at data from three dif-
ferent periods, which we labeled as the “Early” period (August 2009 through April

2010), the “Proximate” period (May 2010 through November 2010), and the “Protest”
period (December 2010 through April 2011). In the Protest period, we have excluded
Egypt, Iran, Libya, and Syria from the analysis because the governments of these
countries actively blocked Internet access during the Arab Spring events.15 We did this
because we were interested in how users behaved when they were given the freedom
to choose.
If social media use had preceded the outbreak of protest, we would expect there to
have been a rise in Facebook registrations as we moved from the early period to the
proximate period. In fact, the growth in Facebook penetration actually slowed between
the early period (M growth = 2.03 percent) and the proximate period (M growth = 1.49
percent; paired sample t-test = 3.05, p = .01). During the protest period, there was a
statistically significant increase in the rate of Facebook registration (M growth = 2.78
percent) compared with the proximate period (paired sample t-test = −2.554, p = .03).16
This indicates that the increase in Facebook registration clearly took place after the
outbreak of violence in these countries, not before it.
Further evidence on this point comes from a study conducted by the Dubai School
of Government (Salem and Mourtada 2011), which also showed a rapid growth in the
number of users and uses of Facebook and Twitter during the first four months of

Wolfsfeld et al. 129
2011—after the onset of the Arab Spring. In many of the countries that experienced
uprisings, such as Tunisia, Egypt, Yemen, and Bahrain, the growth rate of Facebook
users was twice as high as the growth rate a year earlier.
The second test involved looking at changes in Google searches for the query
“Facebook” over time. Table 1 presents four countries, the two with the highest protest
index scores (Egypt and Syria) and the two with the lowest scores (UAE and Oman).
The figures show a sharp rise in searches for Facebook in Egypt and Syria only after
January 25, which marks the beginning of the Egyptian revolution. In the UAE and
Oman, however, searches for Facebook grew steadily and there were no particular

changes during the Arab Spring. To find out whether the Arab Spring caused a signifi-
cant change in the usage of social media, we conducted a regression discontinuity

analysis with two independent variables: week (representing time) and pre–post revo-
lution. As Table 1 shows, when controlling for time, the increase in the usage of social

media was found to be highly significant in the high-conflict environments (Egypt and
Syria) but insignificant in the low-conflict environments. These results demonstrate
that while the increase in social media usage in low-protest environments (measured
by the proxy we used) simply rose over time, the start of the protests was the deciding
factor in the high-protest environments.
The third approach to examining the second principle involved looking at the ways
in which the most frequent Google searches changed during the four different periods.
We assumed that there would be relatively fewer searches for social media and current
event terms before the outbreak of protest, and more such searches once the protests
broke out. We also assumed that the search patterns in countries that experienced a
high level of protest (Egypt and Syria) would be different from those with a low level
of protest (Oman and UAE). In keeping with what has been said about politicized and
nonpoliticized environments, we expected the changes in searches to be more intense
and long-lasting in the high-protest countries. The most frequent searches were mainly
in Arabic but in some cases also in English (e.g., “Facebook” was mostly searched for
in English rather than in Arabic).

Table 2 presents the English translations of the top ten search terms for two high-
protest countries (Egypt and Syria) and two low-protest countries (Oman and UAE).

Search terms that were most closely related to current events have been highlighted.
Some of the search terms (such as YouTube and Google) are somewhat ambiguous in
that they could be linked to either political or nonpolitical searches. However, we
decided to focus on the terms that were more directly linked to social media and
politics.17

The findings provide clear support for our second principle. In the early and proxi-
mate periods, there are relatively few searches for media and current events in any of

the four countries. It is noteworthy that at the same time as Egypt was on the verge of
exploding, the most popular search term was “Games” (although Facebook does come
in second). Using survey data, Norris (2012) reached a similar conclusion about this

preprotest period, finding no indication that the culture of social media was particu-
larly conducive toward dissatisfaction or discontent.

130 The International Journal of Press/Politics 18(2)

In the “protest” period and especially the “after” period, a growing gap emerges
between the number of current event searches in the two high-protest countries and the
two low-protest countries. The top searches of high-protest countries (Egypt and
Syria) include more queries related to news and social media during the protest period
than do those of low-protest countries (Oman and UAE). While the top searches in
low-protest countries did not show different patterns over time, the top searches in
high-protest countries, particularly in Yemen and Libya (data not shown), focused
more on social media and news during and after the protests.
It is worth reiterating that none of these proxies are perfect. It would have been
helpful to have survey data that more directly examined how people’s use of various

media changed over time and among the different countries. The fact that all three
proxies point in the same direction provides evidence supporting the validity of our
second principle, as do the statistically significant differences in the two measures
where such tests were possible.
Conclusions and Perspectives
Our final remarks suggest four ways in which this study can contribute to a better
understanding of the role of social media in collective action. First, the results
should persuade researchers in this field of the critical importance of considering
political context before attempting to analyze the role of social media. Wherever
possible, researchers should try to fully integrate political variables into their
analyses.

A second contribution is related more to the novel insights provided by the cross-
national perspective. While studies that look at this issue using individual- or group-
level analyses are critical, cross-national research provides a completely different

perspective on this issue. This point is demonstrated by the fact that we found a con-
sistently negative correlation between the extent of social media penetration and the

amount of protests. The long-term goal of research in this area should be to integrate
these various perspectives into a more cohesive whole.
A third contribution would be to convince researchers, and perhaps even popular
commentators, to move toward what we called a contextualist approach to this issue.
While few serious scholars in this field can be considered pure enthusiasts or skeptics,
many do seem to overemphasize the centrality of social media in protest. As always,
the “real” question is not whether this or that type of media plays a major role but how
that role varies over time and circumstance.

The fourth potential contribution of this study is its attempt to link the two prin-
ciples to a more general theory in political communication. We made a link to the

political contest model and to the PMP principle, but this was not meant to suggest
that other theoretical frameworks could not be found that are equally or even more

useful. Instead, to build theory in this field, we need to think about both the simi-
larities and the differences in the role different media play in different political

processes.
When looking at what has transpired since the start of the Arab Spring, it is hard to
avoid the conclusion that politics not only came first but also last. The case of Egypt
is instructive in this regard. The Muslim Brotherhood had little to do with initiating the
initial protests and they were probably not the most frequent users of social media.
However, they did have the best political organization available and were ultimately
able to win both the parliamentary and presidential elections. Politics, it would seem,
is important in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end.",Light Offloading,Light Offloading

Graham Allison's Essence of Decision: Explain-
ing the Cuban Missile Crisis, published in 1971

(Little Brown & Company). Allison's volume
is the elaboration of an earlier and influential
article on this subject. With the publication
of his book this approach to foreign policy
now receives its definitive statement. The
bureaucratic interpretation of foreign policy
has become the conventional wisdom.
My argument here is that this vision is

misleading, dangerous, and compelling: mis-
leading because it obscures the power of the

President; dangerous because it undermines
the assumptions of democratic politics by
relieving high officials of responsibility; and
compelling because it offers leaders an
excuse for their failures and scholars an

opportunity for innumerable reinterpreta-
tions and publications.

The contention that the Chief Executive
is trammelled by the permanent government
has disturbing implications for any effort to
impute responsibility to public officials. A
democratic political philosophy assumes that
responsibility for the acts of governments can
be attributed to elected officials. The charges
of these men are embodied in legal statutes.
The electorate punishes an erring official by
rejecting him at the polls. Punishment is
senseless unless high officials are responsible
for the acts of government. Elections have
some impact only if government, that most
complex of modern organizations, can be
controlled. If the bureaucratic machine
escapes manipulation and direction even by
the highest officials, then punishment is
illogical. Elections are a farce not because the
people suffer from false consciousness, but

because public officials are impotent, en-
meshed in a bureaucracy so large that the

actions of government are not responsive to
their will. What sense to vote a man out of
office when his successor, regardless of his
values, will be trapped in the same web of

only incrementally mutable standard operat-
ing procedures?

The Rational Actor Model
Conventional analyses that focus on the
values and objectives of foreign policy, what
Allison calls the Rational Actor Model, are

perfectly coincident with the ethical as-
sumptions of democratic politics. The state

is viewed as a rational unified actor. The
behaviour of states is the outcome of a

rational decision-making process. This proc-
ess has three steps. The options for a given

situation are spelled out. The consequences
of each option are projected. A choice is made

which maximizes the values held by decision-
makers. The analyst knows what the state

did. His objective is to explain why by
imputing to decision-makers a set of values
which are maximized by observed behaviour.
These values are his explanation of foreign
policy.
The citizen, like the analyst, attributes
error to either inappropriate values or lack
of foresight. Ideally the electorate judges the
officeholder by governmental performance
which is assumed to reflect the objectives and
perspicacity of political leaders. Poor policy is
made by leaders who fail to foresee accurately
the consequences of their decisions or attempt
to maximize values not held by the electorate.
Political appeals, couched in terms of aims
and values, are an appropriate guide for
voters. For both the analyst who adheres to
the Rational Actor Model, and the citizen
who decides elections, values are assumed to
be the primary determinant of government
behaviour.
The bureaucratic politics paradigm points
to quite different determinants of policy.
Political leaders can only with great difficulty
overcome the inertia and self-serving interests
of the permanent government. What counts

is managerial skill. In Essence of Decision,
Graham Allison maintains that ""the central
questions of policy analysis are quite different
from the kinds of questions analysts have

traditionally asked. Indeed, the crucial ques-
tions seem to be matters of planning for

management."" Administrative feasibility not
substance becomes the central concern.

The paradoxical conclusion-that bureau-
cratic analysis with its emphasis on policy

guidance implies political non-responsibil-
ity-has most clearly been brought out by

discussions of American policy in Vietnam.
Richard Neustadt on the concluding page of
Alliance Politics, his most recent book, muses
about a conversation he would have had with
President Kennedy in the fall of 1963 had
tragedy not intervened. ""I considered asking

whether, in the light of our machine's per-
formance on a British problem, he conceived

that it could cope with South Vietnam's
....
[I]t was a good question, better than I knew.
It haunts me still."" For adherents of the
bureaucratic politics paradigm, Vietnam was
a failure of the ""machine,"" a war in Arthur
Schlesinger's words ""which no President . . .
desired or intended.""'The machine dictated

a policy which it could not successfully termi-
nate. The machine not the cold war ideology

and hubris of Kennedy and Johnson deter-
mined American behaviour in Vietnam.

Vietnam could hardly be a tragedy for
tragedies are made by choice and character,
not fate. A knowing electorate would express
sympathy not levy blame. Machines cannot
be held responsible for what they do, nor can
the men caught in their workings.
The strength of the bureaucratic web has
been attributed to two sources: organizational
necessity and bureaucratic interest. The costs
of coordination and search procedures are so
high that complex organizations must settle
for satisfactory rather than optimal solutions.
Bureaucracies have interests defined in terms

of budget allocation, autonomy, morale, and
scope which they defend in a game of political

bargaining and compromise within the exec-
utive branch.

The imperatives of organizational behav-
iour limit flexibility. Without a division of

labor and the establishment of standard
operating procedures, it would be impossible
for large organizations to begin to fulfill their
statutory objectives, that is to perform tasks
designed to meet societal needs rather than

merely to perpetuate the organization. A divi-
sion of labor among and within organizations

reduces the job of each particular division to
manageable proportions. Once this division
is made, the complexity confronting an
organization or one of its parts is further

reduced through the establishment of stan-
dard operating procedures. To deal with each

problem as if it were sui generis would be

impossible given limited resources and infor-
mation processing capacity, and would make

intra-organizational coordination extremely
difficult. Bureaucracies are then unavoidably
rigid; but without the rigidity imposed by
division of labor and standard operating

procedures, they could hardly begin to func-
tion at all.

However, this rigidity inevitably introduces
distortions. All of the options to a given
problem will not be presented with equal

lucidity and conviction unless by some hap-
penstance the organization has worked out

its scenarios for that particular problem in

advance. It is more likely that the organiza-
tion will have addressed itself to something

like the problem with which it is confronted.
It has a set of options for such a hypothetical
problem and these options will be presented

to deal with the actual issue at hand. Simi-
larly, organizations cannot execute all policy

suggestions with equal facility. The develop-
ment of new standard operating procedures

takes time. The procedures which would most
faithfully execute a new policy are not likely
to have been worked out. The clash between
the rigidity of standard operating procedures

Laurence Whitehead
1. Introduction
The comparative analysis of democratization processes was a flourishing branch of political science well before the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, on 10 November 1989. That event, its timing, and the transformations through East- Central Europe which it symbolized, were unforeseen not only by virtually all academic observers, but also by world statesmen, foreign ministries, and media commentators. Certainly the available stock of democratization theory was not capable of predicting—or even of strongly suggesting—the course, speed, or sequencing of political developments that converted all the six non-Soviet members of the Warsaw Pact from Communist-ruled regimes into polities operating under more or less competitive electoral systems within about a year. Fortunately such predictive power is not an essential requirement of useful work in comparative politics.
This chapter is based on the assumption that, with the benefit of hindsight, it can still be helpful to re-examine the political upheavals of 1989 deploying the categories and hypotheses distilled from earlier experiences of democratization.Butequally,thesepreexistinganalyticaltoolsmayhavetoberevisedorrefinedinthelightof East-Central European experiences. Initial approaches to the theory of democratization derived from a restrictive range of Latin American and southern European processes which took place within a securely bipolar world, with the result that the international dimension was downplayed and conceived in a restrictive manner. Even with regard to those earlier processes some reconsideration may be called for, given the heightened prominence of international influences apparent in many subsequent cases of regime transition.
However, before the 1989 democratizations can be invoked to justify a possibly wholesale reconstruction of previous analyticalwork,weneedtoconsiderwhethertheseprocessesdoindeedbelonginthesameclassificatoryschemaasthe earlier processes. Participants in the events of 1989 certainly invoked the same vocabulary—of democratization, human and civic rights, the rule of law, and clean and open elections—as their Latin American and southern European predecessors; and indeed, they drew on powerful and long-standing shared traditions of enlightenment liberalism. To some extent they even made explicit cross-references to non-Communist democratizations. Nevertheless, the regimes theyweredismantling(single-party-ruledcommandeconomies)wereverydifferentinstructurefromtheconservative capitalist authoritarian regimes on which most theorizing was based. Transition to a market economy was viewed as an integral (possibly even the dominant) component of democratization. Social structures (universal welfare provision, absence of a strong autonomous civil sphere, or of market-related professional associations) and geopolitical settings were also very different.
The first question to consider, therefore, is whether such key analytical terms as ‘democratization’, ‘consolidation’, and ‘transition’ carry substantially different connotations when deployed in the East-Central European context. This topic is taken up in the second section of the chapter. Then the third section turns to a key feature of the international context that differentiates these from earlier experiences—the persistence for over forty years of a Soviet military veto over full democratization, and the reasons why that veto was lifted in the late 1980s. The fourth section turns to other distinctive features of the international environment, that can be grouped together under the heading ‘the role of the West’.Itconsidersthevariousinfluencesflowingfrom‘theWest’,andtheireffectsinshapingthecourseandcontent of local democratizing impulses. The fifth section reflects on the interactions that took place once the transitions got under way, and relates this to comparative debates on the prospects for democratic consolidation. The conclusion draws together these arguments about the relative weight of various types of international influence on the East- Central European democratizations, and reflects on the implications for pre-existing analysis.",Light Offloading,Light Offloading

Define Your Value Proposition (Step 3)
The next step in the Lean Product Process is to define your product value proposition, which is the next layer in the Product-Market Fit Pyramid. At this point, you have identified several important customer needs that you could potentially address. Now you need to decide which ones your product will address. You want to do so deliberately and resist the temptation to tackle more needs than you should.
A good product is designed with focus on the set of needs that are important and that make sense to address together. Swiss Army knives are incredibly useful, providing a set of tools to address a wide range of needs all in one convenient package. But at some point, as you add more and more tools, a Swiss Army knife gets wider, heavier, less usable, and less valuable. Focus is critical when defining a new product.
You also don't want to unnecessarily risk wasting resources with an initial product scope that is too large. You do not have perfect information about all those customer needs. There is quite a bit of uncertainty in both your hypotheses and in what you think you know. That's why you want to start off by identifying the minimum viable product. Remember, all of your hypotheses about customer needs are hinged on an underlying assumption about your target customer. If you test your MVP and realize that your assumption was wrong, you will have to revisit your hypotheses about the relevant needs to address.
Even if user testing verifies that you are heading in the right direction, you will learn new information that causes you to revise and add to your problem space hypotheses. And this will occur each time you iterate. You'll never have “perfect information.” If you are following a good trajectory as you iterate, there will just be “less imperfect” information that you gather with increasing confidence.
Strategy Means Saying “No”
This step in the Lean Product Process is about determining your product value proposition, which identifies the specific customer needs your product will address and articulates how it is better and different than the alternatives. When you specify the needs your product will address, you are also deciding the other benefits it won't address. It can be difficult for some people to say, “No, our product won't solve that problem”—but that is the essence of strategy. One of the best definitions I've heard of strategy is: “deciding what you're not going to do.” Here's what Steve Jobs had to say about saying “no”:
People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.
So you need to start by selecting the customer needs you plan to address. I will show you how to use the Kano model as an organizing framework, with needs classified as must-haves, performance benefits, or delighters. Since you want to make sure your product will be different and better than the alternatives, you should be classifying needs in the context of your relevant competitors. And since your competitors are usually in the same product category that you are, the must-haves will likely be the same and there will probably be significant overlap among the performance benefits. Different products may have different delighters, though.
It's important to list the must-haves, since they are required. However, since all products in the category have to have them, they are not the core part of your value proposition. The core elements are the performance benefits on which you choose to compete and the unique delighters you plan to provide.",Light Offloading,Light Offloading

•	despite appearance of strength, authoritarian regimes (e.g., Russia, China) have fundamental weaknesses
	low quality decision-making due to concentration of power in a single leader
	lack of accountability, leading to shallow public support that can collapse suddenly
-	Failures of Russian Authoritarianism 
•	Putin’s absolute control has led to catastrophic miscalculations, particularly in Ukraine
•	his isolation led him to underestimate Ukrainian resistance, overestimate his military’s strength & misunderstand the level of corruption in his own ranks
•	Russia´s military failures have eroded Putin´s legitimacy, w large numbers of Russians fleeing conscription & growing internal dissent

•	Concentration of authority in one man led to poor decision making

Over the past decade, global politics has been heavily shaped by apparently strong states whose leaders are not constrained by law or constitutional checks and balances. Russia and China both have argued that liberal democracy is in long-term decline, and that their brand of muscular authoritarian government is able to act decisively and get things done while their democratic rivals debate, dither, and fail to deliver on their promises. These two countries were the vanguard of a broader authoritarian wave that turned back democratic gains across the globe, from Myanmar to Tunisia to Hungary to El Salvador. Over the past year, though, it has become evident that there are key weaknesses at the core of these strong states.

The weaknesses are of two sorts. First, the concentration of power in the hands of a single leader at the top all but guarantees low-quality decision making, and over time will produce truly catastrophic consequences. Second, the absence of public discussion and debate in “strong” states, and of any mechanism of accountability, means that the leader’s support is shallow, and can erode at a moment’s notice.

Supporters of liberal democracy must not give in to a fatalism that tacitly accepts the Russian-Chinese line that such democracies are in inevitable decline. The long-term progress of modern institutions is neither linear nor automatic. Over the years, we have seen huge setbacks to the progress of liberal and democratic institutions, with the rise of fascism and communism in the 1930s, or the military coups and oil crises of the 1960s and ’70s. And yet, liberal democracy has endured and come back repeatedly, because the alternatives are so bad. People across varied cultures do not like living under dictatorship, and they value their individual freedom. No authoritarian government presents a society that is, in the long term, more attractive than liberal democracy, and could therefore be considered the goal or end point of historical progress. The millions of people voting with their feet—leaving poor, corrupt, or violent countries for life not in Russia, China, or Iran but in the liberal, democratic West—amply demonstrate this.


The philosopher Hegel coined the phrase the end of history to refer to the liberal state’s rise out of the French Revolution as the goal or direction toward which historical progress was trending. For many decades after that, Marxists would borrow from Hegel and assert that the true end of history would be a communist utopia. When I wrote an article in 1989 and a book in 1992 with this phrase in the title, I noted that the Marxist version was clearly wrong and that there didn’t seem to be a higher alternative to liberal democracy. We’ve seen frightening reversals to the progress of liberal democracy over the past 15 years, but setbacks do not mean that the underlying narrative is wrong. None of the proffered alternatives look like they’re doing any better.

The weaknesses of strong states have been on glaring display in Russia. President Vladimir Putin is the sole decision maker; even the former Soviet Union had a politburo where the party secretary had to vet policy ideas. We saw images of Putin sitting at the end of a long table with his defense and foreign ministers because of his fear of COVID; he was so isolated that he had no idea how strong Ukrainian national identity had become in recent years or how fierce a resistance his invasion would provoke. He similarly got no word of how deeply corruption and incompetence had taken root within his own military, how abysmally the modern weapons he had developed were working, or how poorly trained his own officer corps was.

The shallowness of his regime’s support was made evident by the rush to the borders of young Russian men when he announced his “partial” mobilization on September 21. Some 700,000 Russians have left for Georgia, Kazakhstan, Finland, and any other country that would take them, a far greater number than has actually been mobilized. Those who have been caught up by the conscription are being thrown directly into battle without adequate training or equipment, and are already showing up on the front as POWs or casualties. Putin’s legitimacy was based on a social contract that promised citizens stability and a modicum of prosperity in return for political passivity, but the regime has broken that deal and is feeling the consequences.


Putin’s bad decision making and shallow support have produced one of the biggest strategic blunders in living memory. Far from demonstrating its greatness and recovering its empire, Russia has become a global object of ridicule, and will endure further humiliations at the hands of Ukraine in the coming weeks. The entire Russian military position in the south of Ukraine is likely to collapse, and the Ukrainians have a real chance of liberating the Crimean Peninsula for the first time since 2014. These reversals have triggered a huge amount of finger-pointing in Moscow; the Kremlin is cracking down even harder on dissent. Whether Putin himself will be able to survive a Russian military defeat is an open question.

Something similar, if a bit less dramatic, has been going on in China. One of the hallmarks of Chinese authoritarianism in the period between Deng Xiaoping’s reforms in 1978 and Xi Jinping’s accession to power in 2013 was the degree to which it was institutionalized. Institutions mean that rulers have to follow rules and cannot do whatever they please. The Chinese Communist Party imposed many rules on itself: mandatory retirement ages for party cadres, strict meritocratic standards for recruitment and promotion, and above all a 10-year term limit for the party’s most-senior leadership. Deng Xiaoping established a system of collective leadership precisely to avoid the dominance of a single obsessive leader like Mao Zedong.


Much of this has been dismantled under Xi Jinping, who will receive the blessing of his party to remain on as paramount leader for a third five-year term at the 20th Party Congress. In place of collective leadership, China has moved to a personalistic system in which no other senior official can come close to challenging Xi.

This concentration of authority in one man has in turn led to poor decision making. The party has intervened in the economy, hobbling the tech sector by going after stars such as Alibaba and Tencent; forced Chinese farmers to plant money-losing staples in pursuit of agricultural self-sufficiency; and insisted on a zero-COVID strategy that keeps important parts of China under continuing lockdowns that have shaved points off the country’s economic growth. China cannot easily reverse zero-COVID, because it has failed to buy effective vaccines and finds a large part of its elderly population vulnerable to the disease. What looked two years ago like a triumphant success in controlling COVID has turned into a prolonged debacle.


All of this comes on top of the failure of China’s underlying growth model, which relied on heavy state investment in real estate to keep the economy humming. Basic economics suggests that this would lead to massive misallocation of resources, as has in fact happened. Go online and search for Chinese buildings being blown up, and you will see many videos of massive housing complexes being dynamited because there is no one to buy apartments in them.

These authoritarian failures are not limited to China. Iran has been rocked by weeks of protests following the death of Mahsa Amini at the hands of the morality police. Iran is in terrible shape: It faces a banking crisis, is running out of water, has seen big declines in agriculture, and is grappling with crippling international sanctions and isolation. Despite its pariah status, it has a well-educated population, in which women constitute a majority of university graduates. And yet the regime is led by a small group of old men with social attitudes several generations out of date. It is no wonder that the regime is now facing its greatest test of legitimacy. The only country that qualifies as even more poorly managed is one with another dictatorship, Venezuela, which has produced the world’s largest outflux of refugees over the past decade.


Celebrations of the rise of strong states and the decline of liberal democracy are thus very premature. Liberal democracy, precisely because it distributes power and relies on consent of the governed, is in much better shape globally than many people think. Despite recent gains by populist parties in Sweden and Italy, most countries in Europe still enjoy a strong degree of social consensus.

The big question mark remains, unfortunately, the United States. Some 30 to 35 percent of its voters continue to believe the false narrative that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, and the Republican Party has been taken over by Donald Trump’s MAGA followers, who are doing their best to put election deniers in positions of power around the country. This group does not represent a majority of the country but is likely to regain control of at least the House of Representatives this November, and possibly the presidency in 2024. The party’s putative leader, Trump, has fallen deeper and deeper into a conspiracy-fueled madness in which he believes that he could be immediately reinstated as president and that the country should criminally indict his presidential predecessors, including one who is already dead.

There is an intimate connection between the success of strong states abroad and populist politics at home. Politicians such as Marine Le Pen and Éric Zemmour in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Matteo Salvini in Italy, and of course Trump in the U.S. have all expressed sympathy for Putin. They see in him a model for the kind of strongman rule they would like to exercise in their own country. He, in turn, is hoping that their rise will weaken Western support for Ukraine and save his flailing “special military operation.”


Liberal democracy will not make a comeback unless people are willing to struggle on its behalf. The problem is that many who grow up living in peaceful, prosperous liberal democracies begin to take their form of government for granted. Because they have never experienced an actual tyranny, they imagine that the democratically elected governments under which they live are themselves evil dictatorships conniving to take away their rights, whether that is the European Union or the administration in Washington. But reality has intervened. The Russian invasion of Ukraine constitutes a real dictatorship trying to crush a genuinely free society with rockets and tanks, and may serve to remind the current generation of what is at stake. By resisting Russian imperialism, the Ukrainians are demonstrating the grievous weaknesses that exist at the core of an apparently strong state. They understand the true value of freedom, and are fighting a larger battle on our behalf, a battle that all of us need to join.
