"hello i would like you to take the following advice and use it to revise the systematic literature review. it should still be about 2000 words after revision. Your systematic literature review (SLR) is well-structured, comprehensive, and methodologically rigorous. However, there are several areas where it could be improved to align more closely with best practices for systematic reviews, as outlined by Siddaway, Wood, and Hedges (2019). Below are key areas for improvement:

1. Introduction: Clarify the Research Gap and Justify the Review
Issue: While you state that a systematic synthesis of sleep deprivation’s effects on risk-taking and moral decision-making is lacking, this claim is not strongly supported with references. You need to explicitly demonstrate the gap by summarizing prior narrative reviews or scattered findings.

Suggestion: Cite previous literature reviews, if available, and explain why a systematic review is necessary.

Example Revision:
""While individual studies have examined the impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive functions such as risk-taking and moral decision-making (e.g., Killgore, 2015; Wang et al., 2022), a comprehensive systematic synthesis of these effects remains absent. Previous reviews have largely focused on broader cognitive impairments (e.g., Brunet et al., 2020), necessitating a focused evaluation of decision-making processes under sleep deprivation conditions.""

Issue: The research question is implied but not explicitly stated.

Suggestion: Clearly articulate the research question using the PICOS framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, Study design), ensuring transparency.

Example Revision:
""This review systematically examines the empirical evidence on how sleep deprivation influences risk-taking behavior and moral decision-making in adults. Specifically, it seeks to answer: (1) To what extent does sleep deprivation affect risk-taking behavior? (2) How does sleep deprivation influence moral decision-making, and are these effects consistent across different populations and methodologies?""

2. Methodology: Improve Transparency and Reproducibility
Issue: The selection of databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, and ResearchGate) lacks justification.

Suggestion: Explain why these databases were chosen and consider replacing ResearchGate with Scopus or Web of Science for better quality control.

Issue: Boolean search terms could be more precise.

Suggestion: Indicate whether Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms or database-specific filters were used.

Issue: The inclusion/exclusion criteria lack detail on methodological rigor.

Suggestion: Specify whether studies needed a minimum sample size, a control group, or specific experimental designs.

Issue: Quality assessment lacks citation of an established tool.

Suggestion: Use a validated tool (e.g., the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or Cochrane’s Risk of Bias Tool) instead of an arbitrary point system.

3. Results: Structure for Clarity and Depth
Issue: The results section presents findings study by study rather than synthesizing them thematically.
Suggestion: Instead of summarizing individual studies sequentially, organize findings around key themes (e.g., ""Cognitive Mechanisms of Risk-Taking under Sleep Deprivation,"" ""Neural Correlates of Moral Decision-Making under Sleep Loss"").
Example Revision:
""Across multiple studies, sleep deprivation was associated with increased risk-taking, particularly in gambling and financial decision-making tasks (Wei et al., 2025; Killgore, 2015). These effects were linked to decreased prefrontal cortex activity and heightened amygdala responses, impairing impulse control (Lei et al., 2017). However, the impact on moral decision-making was more inconsistent, with some studies showing deficits in ethical reasoning (Mazandarani & Jalilian, 2023), while others found preserved moral judgments despite slower cognitive processing (Killgore et al., 2007).""
4. Discussion: Strengthen Theoretical and Practical Implications
Issue: Theoretical interpretations are somewhat superficial.

Suggestion: Provide deeper engagement with models such as the Somatic Marker Hypothesis (Damasio, 1994) or Self-Regulatory Depletion Theory (Baumeister et al., 2007).

Issue: The section on practical implications lacks specificity.

Suggestion: Discuss implications for specific fields (e.g., aviation, healthcare, law enforcement) and possible mitigation strategies (e.g., strategic naps, pharmacological interventions).

Issue: The future research section is too broad.

Suggestion: Suggest specific methodologies (e.g., longitudinal studies, real-world observational designs) and population differences (e.g., age, profession, cultural factors).

5. Conclusion: Increase Precision
Issue: The conclusion is somewhat repetitive.

Suggestion: Emphasize the key contribution of the review in a concise manner.

Example Revision:
""This systematic review highlights the robust association between sleep deprivation and increased risk-taking behavior, mediated by prefrontal dysfunction and amygdala hyperactivity. However, the effects on moral decision-making remain inconclusive, suggesting a need for further research using standardized moral reasoning paradigms. These findings underscore the critical importance of sleep in high-stakes decision-making environments and emphasize the need for workplace interventions to mitigate cognitive impairments due to sleep loss."" The Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Risk-Taking and Moral Decision-Making in Adults
Introduction
Sleep deprivation is a widely researched psychological and physiological phenomenon that occurs when an individual experiences insufficient sleep, leading to cognitive and emotional impairments (Durmer & Dinges, 2005). Research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience has demonstrated that sleep is essential for maintaining executive function, impulse control, and ethical reasoning (Stickgold & Walker, 2007). Given the increasing prevalence of sleep deprivation due to modern lifestyles, it is crucial to understand its impact on key cognitive functions, particularly those associated with decision-making.
Decision-making often involves evaluating risks and moral dilemmas, both of which rely on higher-order cognitive processing. Sleep plays a pivotal role in regulating these processes by maintaining the balance between intuitive and analytical decision-making systems (Evans & Stanovich, 2013). The dual-process theory suggests that individuals rely on both System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (analytical) processing, with sleep deprivation weakening System 2, leading to increased reliance on impulsive, emotion-driven decision-making (Whitney et al., 2015). This impairment may result in heightened risk-taking behaviors and compromised moral reasoning, posing significant implications for various professional and social contexts.
While previous studies have explored the consequences of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance, a systematic synthesis of its effects on risk-taking behavior and moral decision-making in adults is lacking. This review aims to fill this gap by systematically evaluating empirical research on the topic. By doing so, it seeks to determine the extent to which sleep loss influences these cognitive functions and whether these effects are consistent across different populations.
Method
This systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines (Page et al., 2021), ensuring a structured and replicable approach. A comprehensive search was performed across three major academic databases: PubMed, PsycInfo, and ResearchGate. These databases were selected due to their extensive coverage of peer-reviewed research in psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral sciences. The objective was to identify studies examining the effects of sleep deprivation on risk-taking behavior and moral decision-making in adults.
Search Strategy
A predefined search strategy was implemented using Boolean operators to refine results effectively. The search terms included:
(""sleep deprivation"" OR ""sleep restriction"" OR ""insufficient sleep"") AND (""risk-taking"" OR ""decision-making"" OR ""moral judgment"" OR ""impulsivity"")
Filters were applied to restrict the search to peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2009 and 2024 in English-language journals. Studies focusing on children, general sleep patterns without a deprivation component, or unrelated cognitive domains were excluded.
Study Selection Process
The search initially yielded 162 studies. Following the removal of 42 duplicates, 120 studies remained for screening. Title and abstract screening excluded 62 studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 58 studies underwent full-text review, where 48 studies were excluded due to methodological limitations or lack of relevance. Ultimately, 10 studies met all criteria and were included in the final review.
A PRISMA flow diagram (Appendix B) illustrates the study selection process, detailing the number of records identified, screened, excluded, and included in the review.

Results
The final selection of 10 studies provided insight into the relationship between sleep deprivation, risk-taking behavior, and moral decision-making. This section presents a synthesis of the key findings from these studies, highlighting trends, similarities, and discrepancies in the results.
Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Risk-Taking Behavior
Several studies demonstrated a significant relationship between sleep deprivation and increased risk-taking tendencies. Wei et al. (2025) found that sleep-deprived individuals exhibited a heightened propensity for risk-taking, particularly in tasks requiring probabilistic reasoning and long-term reward evaluation. Similarly, Killgore (2015) reported that participants undergoing sleep deprivation made riskier decisions in gambling paradigms compared to their well-rested counterparts.
The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this effect were further explored by Lei et al. (2017), who found that sleep-deprived individuals showed reduced prefrontal cortex activity and heightened amygdala responses during high-risk decision-making tasks. These findings support the hypothesis that sleep deprivation impairs executive control while enhancing emotional reactivity, leading to impulsive risk-taking behavior.
Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Moral Decision-Making
Research on the effects of sleep deprivation on moral decision-making produced mixed results. Mazandarani & Jalilian (2023) found that individuals who experienced partial sleep deprivation displayed deficits in moral reasoning, particularly in complex ethical dilemmas requiring cognitive flexibility. Their findings aligned with those of Wang et al. (2022), who reported that participants with reduced sleep were more likely to endorse self-serving moral choices, potentially due to impaired higher-order cognitive processing.
However, some studies suggested that moral decision-making may be more resilient to sleep deprivation than risk-taking behavior. Killgore et al. (2007) examined moral judgment after 75 hours of sleep deprivation and found that although participants demonstrated slower response times, their moral judgments remained largely intact. These findings suggest that while sleep deprivation can impact the cognitive efficiency of moral decision-making, it may not necessarily lead to significant changes in moral choices themselves.
Summary of Findings
The overall synthesis of the reviewed studies suggests that sleep deprivation significantly increases risk-taking behavior, primarily due to impaired executive function and heightened emotional reactivity. The effects on moral decision-making, however, appear to be more variable, potentially due to differences in task complexity and individual susceptibility to sleep loss.
The next section will discuss these findings in relation to theoretical models, practical implications, and limitations of the existing research.
Discussion
The findings from this systematic review demonstrate a clear relationship between sleep deprivation, risk-taking behavior, and moral decision-making. The reviewed studies consistently suggest that sleep deprivation significantly increases risk-taking tendencies, primarily due to impairments in executive functioning and heightened emotional reactivity (Wei et al., 2025; Killgore, 2015). However, the effects on moral decision-making appear to be more complex, with some studies indicating minimal changes in moral judgments despite slowed cognitive processing (Killgore et al., 2007). This section interprets these findings in relation to existing psychological theories, considers methodological strengths and limitations, and highlights areas for future research.
Interpretation of Findings
The observed increase in risk-taking behavior following sleep deprivation aligns with neurocognitive theories emphasizing the role of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in decision-making. Sleep deprivation is known to impair prefrontal cortex functioning, which is critical for impulse control, long-term planning, and risk evaluation (Lei et al., 2017). Simultaneously, it enhances activity in the amygdala, an area associated with emotional responses, leading to heightened impulsivity and reduced consideration of potential negative outcomes (Yoo et al., 2007). These neurobiological mechanisms provide a strong explanatory framework for why sleep-deprived individuals exhibit increased engagement in risk-taking behavior, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.
The findings related to moral decision-making, however, present a more nuanced picture. While Mazandarani & Jalilian (2023) found that partial sleep deprivation weakened moral reasoning, Killgore et al. (2007) observed that moral decisions themselves remained largely intact, albeit with slower response times. This discrepancy suggests that while cognitive efficiency in processing moral dilemmas is reduced, the underlying moral judgments may not be fundamentally altered. One possible explanation is that moral decision-making may rely more on deeply ingrained ethical frameworks rather than moment-to-moment cognitive control. Additionally, moral decision-making tasks often involve less immediate emotional arousal than risk-taking scenarios, potentially making them more resistant to the effects of sleep deprivation.
Strengths and Limitations of Reviewed Studies
A key strength of the reviewed studies is their methodological diversity, incorporating experimental, observational, and neuroimaging approaches to examine the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation. Studies employing fMRI and EEG analyses (e.g., Lei et al., 2017) provide robust evidence linking sleep deprivation to changes in neural activity, offering objective insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying risk-taking behavior. Additionally, controlled experimental designs with total and partial sleep deprivation paradigms strengthen the causal interpretations of the observed effects (Killgore, 2015).
However, some methodological limitations must be acknowledged. Several studies relied on self-reported sleep deprivation, which may introduce inaccuracies in estimating actual sleep loss (Brunet et al., 2020). Sample sizes varied across studies, with some employing small, non-representative samples, limiting generalizability to broader populations (Leenaars et al., 2021). Furthermore, variations in how risk-taking and moral decision-making were operationalized make direct comparisons across studies challenging. Future research should aim to use standardized assessment tools and larger, more diverse samples to enhance the robustness of findings.
Future Research Directions
Given the observed effects of sleep deprivation on risk-taking but the mixed effects on moral decision-making, several areas warrant further exploration. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of sleep deprivation, as most reviewed research assessed short-term impacts, leaving uncertainty about whether chronic sleep deprivation leads to more profound cognitive changes. Additionally, individual differences in susceptibility to sleep loss should be investigated, as factors such as age, personality traits, and baseline cognitive abilities may moderate these effects. Another critical direction is the assessment of real-world implications, as the majority of studies were conducted in controlled laboratory settings, limiting the ability to generalize findings to professional and everyday decision-making scenarios in fields like healthcare, finance, and law enforcement. Lastly, researchers should explore potential interventions, such as caffeine, mindfulness training, or strategic napping, to determine whether these strategies can mitigate the cognitive impairments associated with sleep deprivation.

Conclusion
This systematic review highlights the significant impact of sleep deprivation on risk-taking behavior and its more nuanced effects on moral decision-making. The evidence strongly suggests that sleep deprivation increases impulsivity and risk-seeking tendencies, largely due to prefrontal cortex dysfunction and amygdala hyperactivity. While some studies indicate that moral decision-making is affected, others suggest that individuals may still adhere to their moral frameworks, albeit with slower cognitive processing.
The findings have important implications for occupational settings, public safety, and mental health, as sleep-deprived individuals may be more prone to engaging in risky behavior with potential real-world consequences. However, the variability in moral decision-making outcomes suggests that further research is needed to determine the precise cognitive mechanisms at play and whether interventions can mitigate these effects.
In conclusion, this review underscores the necessity of adequate sleep for maintaining cognitive control, ethical reasoning, and risk assessment. As modern lifestyles continue to disrupt sleep patterns, understanding the implications of sleep deprivation on decision-making remains an essential area of psychological research with broad societal relevance."

"‘Following Nietzsche’s line of thought, we are compelled to ask the following questions: Is not the man who is completely satisfied by nothing more than universal and equal recognition less than a full human being, indeed, an object of contempt, a “last man” with neither striving nor aspiration? Is there not a side of the human personality that deliberately seeks out struggle, danger, risk, and daring, and will this side not remain unfulfilled by the “peace and prosperity” of contemporary liberal democracy? Does not the satisfaction of certain human beings depend on recognition that is inherently unequal? Indeed, does not the desire for unequal recognition constitute the basis of a liveable life, not just for bygone aristocratic societies, but also in modern liberal democracies? Will not their future survival depend, to some extent, on the degree to which their citizens seek to be recognized not just as equal, but as superior to others? And might not the fear of becoming contemptible “last men”; not lead men to assert themselves in new and unforeseen ways, even to the point of becoming once again bestial “first men” engaged in bloody prestige battles, this time with modern weapons?’

"Dear all, thank you for participating in module 3: Community Outreach.
Please find here the questions to answer for your performance grade, with grading criteria
details below.
1. What was useful about this module and why? This module was extremely useful because it enabled me to gain awareness of what's happening within the community, aiding to the best of my ability coming from a priviledged perspective. This module was useful because it enabled me to be aware of my stereotypical thinking of the refugees in our society, and hearing Safi's perspective of his experience as a refugee with a strong educational background made me be grateful for peace, and made me appreciate my background. This module was also useful because it gave me the opportunity to interact with both locals and refugees in Paris, which not only gave me the opportunity to listen to their stories but also practice empathy. 
2. Describe a specific experience from within the module that felt challenging: I think a difficult part of this module was the language barrier that i faced during the food distribution. I was really excited to interact with the homeless people and just be there in the moment with them and listen to their stories, but due to the fact that I do not speak fluent french, it was quite difficult communicating. Therefore, this part was really challeneging but because I went with a group of french speakers, one of them was able to translate everything that they said, which was really helpful.   
3. What will you do differently moving forward based on the experience you gained from: I will try my best to take time off to volunteer in paris to the best of my ability, and interact with more refugees around, as they are also human need kindness, just like everyone would.  
 How do you think you could have an impact on those around you? through joining serve the city in their different activities such as the food distribution which I really enjoyed, as well as the language exchange which could help me imporve my french when interacting with the locals.  
4. Social / Emotional skills develop with continuous and intentional effort. What other ways
are you advancing your personal development relating specifically to the learning
objectives of module three? Beyond this, I am advancing my personal development through constant journaling of my experiences, as well as deep meditation which helps me calm down especially in moments where  I feel overwhelmed by whats happening around the world, with the global instability especially in countries affected by war.

"as a democracy & democratisation expert, explain this in detail. do it in a discoursive way following the authors train, also it has to be extremely detailed : During the past 20 years, many countries that were formally non- democracies have become democracies. Essentially this chapter is an empirical discussion of how democratisation took place in the recent and more distant past. It suggests that the way in which societies became democratic (or not) depended significantly on the way in which they were organised prior to democratisation. This chapter should be read in conjunction with the next chapter, which examines some theories of why democratisation occurred.
Huntington’s (1991) notion that there have been three waves of democratisation has generally been accepted as empirically useful. The first wave of countries essentially adopted democratic principles in the nineteenth century. They included:
• the USA
• Switzerland
• France
• Britain.
The second wave consisted of countries that democratised after the defeat of fascism in 1945. The list includes:
• (the then) West Germany • Italy
• Japan
• Austria.
The third wave began in 1974 with the overthrow of the authoritarian government of Portugal. The military government in Greece also fell
in 1974, and the following year the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco died. By 1980, these three southern European countries had all become democracies. During the next decade, the majority of Latin American countries changed from non-democracies to democracies. Many African countries also adopted democracy in the 1980s or early 1990s. From the late 1980s, the countries of eastern Europe also rejected communism and adopted democracy. The process culminated in mid-1991, when a failed coup attempt brought about the destruction of the Soviet Union as a unit. Many, though not all, of its component parts became democracies.
It is, however, important to qualify the notion of ‘waves’ in one respect. In
the past, in some regions of the world there were almost as many cases
of democratic breakdown as of democratisation. To adapt Huntington’s phraseology, waves sometimes pulled away from the shore as well as
moving towards it. Latin America has suffered several waves of democratic breakdown, the most important of which took place in the 1930s, 1960s and early 1970s. In continental Europe, many parliamentary systems were set up at the end of the First World War and the majority of these broke down in the 1920s or early 1930s. In the 1930s, many observers believed that fascism or communism, and not democracy, would be the wave of the future.
What is significant for this discussion is that there has been much less democratic breakdown since 1980 than there was following earlier ‘waves’ of democratisation. By the middle of the 1990s, well over 50 countries that
 36
were not democracies at the beginning of 1974 had become democracies. Most of these were in the Third World, and so far the vast majority of these democratic transitions have not been reversed. Some countries nevertheless did suffer from democratic breakdown. A military coup took place in Pakistan in 1999, and serious problems were seen with the electoral process in Zimbabwe in 2002. It is also clear that some important parts of the
world – China and much of the Middle East – did not participate in the most recent democratising wave. Nonetheless, we cannot really speak of any major reversal of the most recent wave of democratisation.
However, progress towards democracy has slowed down since the mid- 1990s. Even so, the extent of democratisation has surprised scholars.
As we shall see in more detail in the next chapter, some modernisation theories did not expect the spread of democracy across Africa and Latin America to be sustained. It is true that some new democracies do not seem to be particularly secure and that only some of the countries that have democratised since 1974 can be regarded as democratically consolidated. Nevertheless, as we saw in the last chapter, the criterion of democratic consolidation is demanding. The mere fact that democracy has proved as durable as it has over quite long periods of time is significant.
One way of trying to understand the magnitude of this transformation is to consider how different forms of non-democracies have evolved into democracies or, on occasion, have failed to do so. This approach will be considered in the rest of this chapter.
Colonial rule and the collapse of empires
An important force behind political change has been the decline, or in some cases, collapse of empires. This process has sometimes created entirely new countries – new countries that need new political systems. Ex-colonial countries have not invariably adopted democratic systems
of government. Former British colonies have often done so – the USA, India and Ireland are positive examples – but there are negative examples as well, such as Pakistan. Former Spanish colonies did not immediately develop democratic institutions, even in countries, such as Argentina, that were settled principally from Europe. Nevertheless, the history of decolonisation has seen major changes in the way in which very large numbers of people have been governed.
The defeat of the British Empire in the War of American Independence had particularly important consequences for the history of democracy worldwide. The USA pioneered the presidential system of government, which today is the main alternative to parliamentarianism. A generation later, the success of many former Latin American colonies of Spain and Portugal in securing independence also brought into existence new states and new constitutional systems – although constitutional development was much less successful in Latin America than in the USA. Most Latin American countries adopted hybrid systems that include:
• presidentialism
• continental European systems of administrative law
• a tradition of rule by decree.
Unfortunately, very few systems of this kind have truly consolidated institutionally in the long run.
In 1918, the collapse of the Austro–Hungarian Empire also brought
a number of new states into existence. Attempts were made to set up democratic parliamentary systems in most of these new states, but virtually all of them failed, falling victim to authoritarian forms of politics by the 1930s. Many were then occupied or controlled by the Nazis during 1941– 45. In some cases re-democratisation followed the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 and in others it followed the collapse of Communism in the 1980s.
After the Second World War, the European empires pursued a consistent, if not always voluntary, policy of decolonisation. The political results
of independence were mixed, but at least some countries adopted and retained democratic systems. India famously adopted a democratic parliamentary system in the late 1940s, while some other countries, notably in Africa, only became democracies in the 1980s ‘wave’, and sometimes not even then.
Political consequences of imperial control and decolonisation prior to 1990
The effect of imperial collapse upon democratisation was therefore rather mixed. In some very important cases, the end of empire led to democratisation, but this was by no means the only outcome. It is clear that democratisation did spread after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, but much less clear that the collapse of previous empires had so general an effect. The consequences of earlier forms of imperial control and decolonisation in various parts of the world depended upon (among other things):
• the character of the imperial society
• the extent to which there was settlement from the metropolitan country
• the historical epoch in which the colonising and decolonising took place.
In some cases, the impact of colonial rule was utterly destructive. Indigenous populations in much of the Americas were either totally wiped out or greatly reduced in number.
In other cases, the colonial power sought to reduce the cost of direct administration, either by allowing some precolonial patterns of authority to survive or by developing and transmitting new institutions. This was done with varying degrees of success in different parts of the world. In some cases, European colonial powers were able to legitimate their rule, in the sense that subjects of the empire wished to remain so, at times on the basis of full-scale integration into the imperial country, but such cases are extremely few. Sometimes, willing ex-colonies have proved to be more a source of embarrassment than satisfaction to the colonial power, which wanted to find an acceptable means of getting rid of a colony eager to stay in the empire – the Falkland Islands are one example and Gibraltar another. Of course, the Falklands are populated by British settlers rather than indigenous people. On the other hand, though, indigenous peoples in Martinique and French Guyana are content to remain part of France. This kind of government is not inevitably non-democratic, in the sense that the French Guyanese vote in French elections and the Falkland Islanders elect a council of their own.
Far more often, however, the imperial power was unable to persuade former colonies to remain as colonies. When the opportunity for independence presented itself, it was generally accepted and sometimes seized. We can identify four possible ways in which decolonisation interacted with democratisation:
• continuity and democratisation
 38
• continuity and non-democratisation
• discontinuity and democratisation
• discontinuity and non-democratisation.
Continuity and democratisation
In some cases, independent countries adopted democratic institutions from their former colonial powers (which were themselves democracies). It sometimes mattered that independence was granted and accepted on relatively good terms, though this was not necessarily decisive. Britain retained good relations with India after independence in 1947, and India adopted and maintained a parliamentary system based on the British model. The same was also true of British Honduras, which became known as Belize upon independence in 1981. Nevertheless, the bitterly fought independence movement in Ireland did not preclude Ireland from adopting parliamentary institutions after 1922.
Continuity and non-democratisation
In some cases, the independent country threw off the control of a non- democracy, but did not democratise when it did so. A form of colonial rule
that was doubly non-democratic (both because colonialism is not inherently democratic and because the colonial power was not a democracy) then gave way to a non-democratic but local form of post-colonial rule. When Brazil became independent from Portugal in the 1820s, it retained a monarchical system of government. The monarchy was not overthrown until 1889, and Brazil did not really establish a democratic form of government until the 1980s.
Discontinuity and democratisation
The category most relevant to the issue of democratic transition occurred where the collapse of a non-democratic empire led to the adoption
of democracy in the newly independent countries. When Soviet rule collapsed in Eastern Europe after 1989, most of the countries of eastern Europe adopted democratic systems of government. They did so partly in reaction to the unpopular Communist system imposed upon them earlier, partly out of a genuine preference for democracy and partly because the new states enjoyed the support of the USA and the European Union. Such cases are illustrations of transition to democracy via imperial collapse.
Discontinuity and non-democratisation
In some cases, newly independent countries seemed likely to adopt democratic parliamentary systems similar to those existing in their former colonial powers, but in the end did not do so. This pattern of abortive democracy is common in Africa, although the past decade has seen significant amounts of re-democratisation in the region. Vietnam and Algeria became independent from France when France was a democracy, but they did not democratise themselves.
Negative legacies of colonialism
Sometimes the impact of colonialism created problems that made it hard for post-colonial countries to become stable democracies. One of the legacies of colonialism was that centralised states and national borders were organised over territories that had not previously known them or that had experienced quite different boundaries at earlier times. Borders that once seemed artificial often remained intact after the ending of colonial rule and tensions often resulted from a poor ‘fit’ between the externally imposed national borders and the original allegiances of indigenous peoples. Because empires were coercive, they sometimes imposed a single form of rule on ethnically or religiously divided territories. The downfall of such empires has led, at times, to an upsurge in conflict between different ethnic or religious groups as each tried to consolidate its own territorial claims.
Sometimes a clear-cut secession is possible and may appear to resolve the issue (for example, the Czech Republic and Slovakia agreed to separate in 1991). At other times, clear-cut solutions are less easy to find and serious armed conflict may develop. These conflicts did not absolutely prevent subsequent democratisation but they did make it more difficult. Examples include:
• the former republics of Yugoslavia in the 1990s
• Ireland after 1922
• India/Pakistan after 1947.
One might conclude this discussion, therefore, by saying that empires, although they do not often make any successful claim to legitimacy in their own terms, do at times develop institutions that can be transmitted successfully to colonies and kept on after independence. It is often a matter of contingency whether or not this happens, however, and there have been many failures as well as successes. For this reason, the decline of empires – although an opportunity for democratic transition – can also be a time of very great disorder and conflict.
Whether the influence exerted today by the USA over Latin America and by some European countries over parts of Africa can be considered imperial
is controversial. What is clear, though, is that attempts by the USA and
to some extent Europe to export democracy to various parts of the world have been influential. In southern and eastern Europe, countries that could sustain democratic institutions over the long term could enjoy the prospect of membership of the European Union. Such membership is advantageous on many grounds. In the African case, quite significant amounts of aid have been made conditional on democratisation. The relative importance of this linkage for democracy has varied from case to case and is never preponderant. International bodies do have to work through local agents
if they are to succeed and most Africans do prefer democracy. At the very least, however, the international community is much less supportive of non- democracy in the Third World than was once the case. In Latin America,
too, international influence has played a part in discouraging dictatorship, although abundant survey evidence shows that most people within the region prefer democracy, and this fact needs to be taken into account as well.
Consequences of the breaking-up of the former Soviet Union in 1991
The central event in the third wave of democratisation was the fall of the former Soviet Union. Although Soviet rule over eastern Europe loosened considerably after 1986, the seminal event here was the breaking up of the former Soviet Union after a failed military coup attempt in 1991. This had three important consequences.
1. Several countries in eastern Europe that would probably have adopted democracy if left to themselves could then do so. The Soviet Union had supported communist rule in eastern Europe and invaded Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 in order to preserve communism in the region, but from the late 1980s, the former Soviet Union no longer tried to do so.
2. The decline and eventual disintegration of the former Soviet Union changed the nature of politics in other parts of the world. Communist parties in non-communist countries needed to rethink their ideologies and strategies. This was also true of anti-communists. Some of those who had supported military rule in Latin America because they believed that this was the only way of suppressing communism had to re-evaluate their positions. Similarly, the USA and some European governments, which had previously backed non-democratic rulers
in parts of the Third World because they were anti-communist and likely to suppress communism, no longer needed to do so. The USA, in particular, became a global advocate of democratisation and this is also true of the European Union.
3. A number of newly independent republics that had formerly been part of the Soviet Union (though not all of them) subsequently adopted democratic systems of government.

Other forms of non-democratic organisation
We now turn to countries that have made the transition to democracy without major changes in their basic identity or international relations. There are three fairly common forms of non-democratic rule in the world today:
• monarchy
• military government
• rule via a dominant party system.
We might want to make a further distinction between totalitarian and authoritarian rule, but this will not be discussed in great detail here, because it is not directly relevant to democratisation.
Monarchy
A number of countries are monarchies today, but for many it is in name only, in the sense that the monarch is a figurehead for what is, in practice, parliamentary government. Nepal, Saudi Arabia and the Emirates of
the Persian Gulf are still run on monarchical principles, and the King of Thailand exerts real, though not absolute, power in his country.
At first sight, the concept of monarchy might fit perfectly into Weber’s belief that some political systems can be run on the basis of ‘traditional’ legitimation. There can be little doubt that the maintenance of a figurehead monarchy in parliamentary democracies relates to the aim of legitimating political authority among certain sections of the population. Soldiers in the UK are asked to risk their lives for ‘Queen and country’. The appeal of ‘Prime Minister and country’ may be somewhat less. Monarchists in the UK would almost certainly win a referendum on the question of whether the UK should become a republic. It would be far too much to claim that the monarchy in the UK legitimates the political system as
a whole, but it probably plays a modest part in the overall process of legitimating state power. In countries where the monarch actually does rule, it would, by the same token, be too simple to adopt an uncritical definition of traditionalism. Traditionalism usually is, to some degree, contrived and deliberately designed to maintain stability. Another Middle Eastern monarchy – that of Reza
Shah II in Iran – could scarcely be seen as traditional at all, although this partially explains its undoing. In 1979, the Shah was overthrown by religious fundamentalists, who did not believe that he was traditional enough.
Most observers have attributed the survival of the Saudi and Gulf monarchies less to the legitimation produced by traditional values than
to the neo-patrimonial allocation of resources in oil-rich countries (see Crystal, 1990). In other words, oil money is recycled through these societies as a result of essentially personalist decisions made by the ruling families. The money clearly alleviates social discontent. The deliberate arbitrariness and unpredictability of a system that depends upon individual decision-making creates some degree of insecurity within civil society. As a result, people who need access to public money are less likely to try to organise themselves in order to demand their rights or oppose the government. The objective of all of this from the viewpoint of the rulers is not so much to build political institutions as to avoid the need for them, although family networks remain.
Monarchical systems can, however, undertake the transition to democracy. Sometimes this may occur because of the will of the monarch. A notable example of this occurred in Spain after 1975 when King Juan Carlos made a determined attempt to ensure that his country adopted democratic principles. Although there were some anxious moments, in the end the transition to democracy was a clear success. When this happens, it is likely that the country will retain a constitutional monarchy. Such a system can remain a surprisingly popular form of government as long as the monarch does not seek to undermine the principles of the constitution. At other times, though, monarchs have been opposed to democratisation and have either prevented it from happening or else have fallen from power under pressure from forces demanding change. The most spectacular recent case was the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979. Since it is hard to think of a smooth and sustained transition to democracy that has also involved the overthrow of a monarchy, it is likely that democratic prospects are enhanced when the monarch supports democratic transition rather than opposes it.
Military government
Military rule, like monarchy, is a more complex form of government than it may at first seem. It may indeed appear coercive and repressive. After all it might be said that the whole point of military rule is to introduce policies and forms of governance different from those the people would choose
if they could. Often, it is true that the whole purpose of military rule is to block democratic government. Some significant exceptions to this rule do exist, however, and the question of how military rule can give way to democratic government is complex.
Sometimes the military itself initiates democratisation. This may happen because military rulers have got into difficulties and seek some form of extrication. Commonly, a military withdrawal from power occurs on the implicit basis that it could be cancelled or reversed later on. Military officers may be more willing to hand over power to civilians if they think that the new arrangement may only be temporary. Of course, if democracy is to survive, any expectation that the military is handing back power temporarily will have to be changed at a later date. This is, to a degree, what happened in Latin America in the early 1980s. Many officers who
were involved in handing back power to elected civilians did so in the belief that this was just another phase in a cycle of military and civilian rule. Only in retrospect did the transfer appear definite. What needs to be explained, therefore, is less the original decision to hand power back than the inability or unwillingness of the military to organise fresh intervention. The changed international environment may be an important part of the explanation for this.
Another possible pattern of transition occurs when the military seeks
to move from a position of outright dictatorship to a position in which
they still rule, but in which they do so in a more indirect and therefore theoretically more constitutional way. Sometimes, a move from open dictatorship to semi-dictatorship has appeared to work. General Pinochet in Chile twice won plebiscites – in 1978 and 1980. In the longer run, however, semi-dictatorship is an unstable form of government. By attempting to sustain it, military rulers have often put themselves in positions where they had to give up power altogether. When General Pinochet lost the 1988 plebiscite (his third), he was forced to give up power altogether. By the same token, military officers sometimes prefer one civilian political party to another and they may try to organise democratic transition in such a way as to help their friends. If the military government is unpopular, however, people may vote for a candidate who is seen as the most anti-military of all of those available.
Another reason for the military allowing a transition to democracy is
that it sometimes sees no further point in continuing to govern. Military officers are not necessarily anti-democrats in principle – they may have genuine institutional concerns. One reason the military sometimes distrusts democracy has to do with the concept of hierarchy, which is central to the military itself. The military organisation is based on hierarchy, discipline
and obedience, not on participation or activism. To that extent, it can be threatened by civil commotion and political militancy. After a period of time, however, it may come to feel that society has changed and the danger has passed. After 1975 the Spanish military was mostly prepared to believe that the circumstances prevailing at the time of the 1936–39 Civil War no longer existed. The decline of communism in the 1980s also persuaded some military officers in South America that they had less to fear from democracy.
A less stable way by which military governments have sometimes tried to adapt to democracy was for officers to make the transition into civilian politics. It is not impossible for officers who have already taken power
to organise some kind of political party, provided that they are willing
to accept a transition from military to civilian life. Colonel Peron played
an important part in the Argentine military coup of 1943, but thereafter behaved much as any civilian politician. Although Peron himself was eventually overthrown by the military in 1955, Peronism was (and is) a successful political movement. Similarly, the Mexican Revolutionary Party was created by successful revolutionary generals willing to operate through a party organisation. Today, the party is wholly civilian. In ex-military or semi- military governments in the Middle East, the instrument of government is a ruling party rather than the military. However, these transitions, real though they were, did not for the most part lead quickly to stable democracy.
Finally, the military may simply be defeated and become unable to maintain itself in power. In this situation, however, political change will not necessarily lead to democracy. In Cuba, the military dictator Batista was overthrown by Fidel Castro in 1959, and in Nicaragua, the military dictator Somoza was overthrown by the Sandinistas in 1979. Neither of these dictatorships was typical of the region – they were much more
Chapter 3: Non-democratic systems and the transition to democracy
43 personalistic than the majority. However, this does not alter the fact
that they were overthrown by force. Nicaragua, after a flirtation with communism, eventually evolved in the direction of democracy; Cuba remains authoritarian. In other cases, political change has been precipitated by defeat by an external force. The Argentine military government fell in 1982–83 following a military defeat by the UK, and democracy returned to Panama after the USA invaded and deposed General Noriega in 1989.
Activity
List the main real-world cases that involved democratisation of monarchical systems and the democratisation of military governments.
Dominant party government
The idea of government by an all-controlling party largely stems
from Lenin’s organisation of the Russian Bolsheviks. Lenin set up a Revolutionary party, not in order to compete for power in a democratic system, but rather to seize power from an autocracy. His idea was to create a strongly disciplined elite party composed of professional revolutionaries – a so-called vanguard party. This would, in turn, control a range of other organisations either openly or through clandestinity.
Lenin did not bring about the overthrow of the Tsarist monarchy. He did not expect this to happen, and played little part in it. What he did do was take advantage of the power vacuum that followed the defeat of the Tsar in order to organise the seizure of power. The Bolsheviks were then able to take control of the whole of the Soviet Union and govern until the entire system collapsed at the end of the 1980s.
The idea of a vanguard party was hugely influential in other parts of the world. However, the communist parties in China, Cuba and Yugoslavia differed from the Bolsheviks in that they were originally, in large part, military organisations as well as political ones. Mao, Tito and Castro actually took power by force from pre-existing dictatorships. The military aspect of government in these countries was correspondingly greater than that in the former Soviet Union.
We have already noted that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Essentially, it was torn apart by internal conflicts between would-be modernisers and traditionalists who wanted to retain the Soviet Empire at all costs. Meanwhile, some of the modernisers had become alienated from the Communist Party and wanted a new kind of political system altogether. Most dominant party systems, however, are run in a very disciplined way by people who understand that internal disunity is likely to have very serious consequences, which is what happened in the former Soviet Union. Of the world’s remaining non-democracies, the most important are based on dominant party systems run by autocratic leaders.
Can Leninist vanguard systems adapt to democratic circumstances? Evidence shows that they can, even though they may not particularly
want democracy. The Mexican PRI had many of the characteristics of a dominant party system, although it was able to adapt to democratisation. The same was also true for the former ruling party in Taiwan. Both of these parties were able to retain an essential degree of unity, while moving from being authoritarian parties to parties willing to engage in democratic contestation. Both eventually lost power via the popular vote, but neither disintegrated completely. Both parties continue to play an active part in democratic politics.

Chapter 3: Non-democratic systems and the transition to democracy
 Transitions to democracy
It is difficult to theorise about democratic transition on the basis of logical deduction about the strengths and weaknesses of non-democratic forms of rule – so many different possibilities exist. Moreover, subjective factors – such as whether particular individuals prefer democracy or distrust it – may matter as much as objective conditions.
Attempts have been made to discuss democratic transition in more general terms, however.
• A first influential approach is based on ideas about class power and state power.
• A second approach is based on ideas of economic change and assumes that democratisation is associated with economic progress. This kind
of approach – known as modernisation theory – is also discussed in the next chapter. It is important to note, however, that a number of quite poor countries have democratised since 1985, and that this is something that modernisation theory on its own would have failed to predict.
• A third approach refuses to consider general ideas and puts a lot of emphasis on the detail of individual cases (see di Palma, 1990). If 50 countries have democratised in the past 15 years, there are likely to be 50 different combinations of factors responsible. This approach
is valuable as a corrective, and it reminds us that democratisation is something that has to be brought about by political practitioners: it does not just happen by itself. Yet, if there were no general influences, one would expect democratisation to be something of a random process.
In point of fact, democratisation has generally occurred in waves rather than as a set of random events. We do need, therefore, to consider changes in international politics. These are not the only relevant factors, but
they clearly matter and they are capable of being analysed in reasonably general terms.
A reminder of your learning outcomes
Having completed this chapter, and the Essential reading and activities, you should be able to:
• explain the main problems and difficulties that are likely to be associated with democratising each system of government discussed in this chapter (empire, monarchy, military government and dominant party rule)
• explain how transition could happen in different kinds of non-democratic political system."
"explain this sentence form Said's introduction in Orietalism:  Therefore, Orientalism is not a mere political subject matter or field that is reflected passively by culture, scholarship, or institutions; nor is it a large and diffuse collection of texts about the Orient: nor is it representative and expressive of some nefarious ""Western"" imperialist plot to hold down the ""Oriental"" world. It is rather a distribution of geopolitical awareness into aesthetic, scholarly, economic, sociological, historical, and philological texts; it is an elaboration not only of a basic geographical distinction (the world is made up of two unequal halves, Orient and Occident) but also of a whole series of ""interests"" which, by such means scholarly discovery, philological reconstruction, psychological analysis, landscape and sociological description, it not only creates but also maintains; it is, rather than expresses, a certain will or intention to understand, in some cases to control, manipulate, even to incorporate, what is a manifestly different (or alternative and novel) world; it is, above all, a discourse that is by no means in direct, corresponding relationship with political power in the raw, but rather is produced and exists in an uneven exchange with various kinds of power, shaped to a degree by the exchange with power political (as with a colonial or imperial establishment), power intellectual (as with reigning sciences like comparative linguistics or anatomy, or any of the modern policy sciences), power cultural (as with orthodoxies and canons of taste, texts, values), power moral (as with ideas about what ""we"" do and what ""they"" cannot do or understand as ""we"" do). Indeed, my real argument is that Orientalism is- and does not simply represent- a considerable dimension of modern political-intellectual culture, and as such has less to do with the Orient than it does with ""our"" world.
Because Orientalism is a [cultural and a political fact, then, it does not exist in some archival vacuum; quite the contrary, I think it can be shown that what is thought, said, or even done about the Orient follows (perhaps occurs within) certain distinct and intellectually knowable lines.
Here too a considerable degree of nuance and elaboration can be seen working as between the broad superstructural pressures and the details of composition, the facts of textuality. Most humanistic scholars are, I think, perfectly happy with the notion that texts exist in contexts, that there is such a thing as intertextuality, that the pressures of conventions, predecessors, and rhetorical styles limit what Walter Benjamin once called the ""overtaxing of the productive person in the name of ..

Q&A / John Nichols

This article appears in the October 22, 2001 issue.
Samuel Huntington’s article ""The Clash of Civilizations?"" appeared in the Summer 1993 issue of Foreign Affairs, where it immediately attracted a surprising amount of attention and reaction. Because the article was intended to supply Americans with an original thesis about ""a new phase"" in world politics after the end of the cold war, Huntington’s terms of argument seemed compellingly large, bold, even visionary. He very clearly had his eye on rivals in the policy-making ranks, theorists such as Francis Fukuyama and his ""end of history"" ideas, as well as the legions who had celebrated the onset of globalism, tribalism and the dissipation of the state. But they, he allowed, had understood only some aspects of this new period. He was about to announce the ""crucial, indeed a central, aspect"" of what ""global politics is likely to be in the coming years."" Unhesitatingly he pressed on:

""It is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural. Nation states will remain the most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of different civilizations. The clash of civilizations will dominate global politics. The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future.""

Most of the argument in the pages that followed relied on a vague notion of something Huntington called ""civilization identity"" and ""the interactions among seven or eight [sic] major civilizations,"" of which the conflict between two of them, Islam and the West, gets the lion’s share of his attention. In this belligerent kind of thought, he relies heavily on a 1990 article by the veteran Orientalist Bernard Lewis, whose ideological colors are manifest in its title, ""The Roots of Muslim Rage."" In both articles, the personification of enormous entities called ""the West"" and ""Islam"" is recklessly affirmed, as if hugely complicated matters like identity and culture existed in a cartoonlike world where Popeye and Bluto bash each other mercilessly, with one always more virtuous pugilist getting the upper hand over his adversary. Certainly neither Huntington nor Lewis has much time to spare for the internal dynamics and plurality of every civilization, or for the fact that the major contest in most modern cultures concerns the definition or interpretation of each culture, or for the unattractive possibility that a great deal of demagogy and downright ignorance is involved in presuming to speak for a whole religion or civilization. No, the West is the West, and Islam Islam.

The challenge for Western policy-makers, says Huntington, is to make sure that the West gets stronger and fends off all the others, Islam in particular. More troubling is Huntington’s assumption that his perspective, which is to survey the entire world from a perch outside all ordinary attachments and hidden loyalties, is the correct one, as if everyone else were scurrying around looking for the answers that he has already found. In fact, Huntington is an ideologist, someone who wants to make ""civilizations"" and ""identities"" into what they are not: shut-down, sealed-off entities that have been purged of the myriad currents and countercurrents that animate human history, and that over centuries have made it possible for that history not only to contain wars of religion and imperial conquest but also to be one of exchange, cross-fertilization and sharing. This far less visible history is ignored in the rush to highlight the ludicrously compressed and constricted warfare that ""the clash of civilizations"" argues is the reality. When he published his book by the same title in 1996, Huntington tried to give his argument a little more subtlety and many, many more footnotes; all he did, however, was confuse himself and demonstrate what a clumsy writer and inelegant thinker he was.

The basic paradigm of West versus the rest (the cold war opposition reformulated) remained untouched, and this is what has persisted, often insidiously and implicitly, in discussion since the terrible events of September 11. The carefully planned and horrendous, pathologically motivated suicide attack and mass slaughter by a small group of deranged militants has been turned into proof of Huntington’s thesis. Instead of seeing it for what it is–the capture of big ideas (I use the word loosely) by a tiny band of crazed fanatics for criminal purposes–international luminaries from former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi have pontificated about Islam’s troubles, and in the latter’s case have used Huntington’s ideas to rant on about the West’s superiority, how ""we"" have Mozart and Michelangelo and they don’t. (Berlusconi has since made a halfhearted apology for his insult to ""Islam."")


But why not instead see parallels, admittedly less spectacular in their destructiveness, for Osama bin Laden and his followers in cults like the Branch Davidians or the disciples of the Rev. Jim Jones at Guyana or the Japanese Aum Shinrikyo? Even the normally sober British weekly The Economist, in its issue of September 22-28, can’t resist reaching for the vast generalization, praising Huntington extravagantly for his ""cruel and sweeping, but nonetheless acute"" observations about Islam. ""Today,"" the journal says with unseemly solemnity, Huntington writes that ""the world’s billion or so Muslims are ‘convinced of the superiority of their culture, and obsessed with the inferiority of their power.’"" Did he canvas 100 Indonesians, 200 Moroccans, 500 Egyptians and fifty Bosnians? Even if he did, what sort of sample is that?

Uncountable are the editorials in every American and European newspaper and magazine of note adding to this vocabulary of gigantism and apocalypse, each use of which is plainly designed not to edify but to inflame the reader’s indignant passion as a member of the ""West,"" and what we need to do. Churchillian rhetoric is used inappropriately by self-appointed combatants in the West’s, and especially America’s, war against its haters, despoilers, destroyers, with scant attention to complex histories that defy such reductiveness and have seeped from one territory into another, in the process overriding the boundaries that are supposed to separate us all into divided armed camps.

This is the problem with unedifying labels like Islam and the West: They mislead and confuse the mind, which is trying to make sense of a disorderly reality that won’t be pigeonholed or strapped down as easily as all that. I remember interrupting a man who, after a lecture I had given at a West Bank university in 1994, rose from the audience and started to attack my ideas as ""Western,"" as opposed to the strict Islamic ones he espoused. ""Why are you wearing a suit and tie?"" was the first retort that came to mind. ""They’re Western too."" He sat down with an embarrassed smile on his face, but I recalled the incident when information on the September 11 terrorists started to come in: how they had mastered all the technical details required to inflict their homicidal evil on the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and the aircraft they had commandeered. Where does one draw the line between ""Western"" technology and, as Berlusconi declared, ""Islam’s"" inability to be a part of ""modernity""?

One cannot easily do so, of course. How finally inadequate are the labels, generalizations and cultural assertions. At some level, for instance, primitive passions and sophisticated know-how converge in ways that give the lie to a fortified boundary not only between ""West"" and ""Islam"" but also between past and present, us and them, to say nothing of the very concepts of identity and nationality about which there is unending disagreement and debate. A unilateral decision made to draw lines in the sand, to undertake crusades, to oppose their evil with our good, to extirpate terrorism and, in Paul Wolfowitz’s nihilistic vocabulary, to end nations entirely, doesn’t make the supposed entities any easier to see; rather, it speaks to how much simpler it is to make bellicose statements for the purpose of mobilizing collective passions than to reflect, examine, sort out what it is we are dealing with in reality, the interconnectedness of innumerable lives, ""ours"" as well as ""theirs.""

In a remarkable series of three articles published between January and March 1999 in Dawn, Pakistan’s most respected weekly, the late Eqbal Ahmad, writing for a Muslim audience, analyzed what he called the roots of the religious right, coming down very harshly on the mutilations of Islam by absolutists and fanatical tyrants whose obsession with regulating personal behavior promotes ""an Islamic order reduced to a penal code, stripped of its humanism, aesthetics, intellectual quests, and spiritual devotion."" And this ""entails an absolute assertion of one, generally de-contextualized, aspect of religion and a total disregard of another. The phenomenon distorts religion, debases tradition, and twists the political process wherever it unfolds."" As a timely instance of this debasement, Ahmad proceeds first to present the rich, complex, pluralist meaning of the word jihad and then goes on to show that in the word’s current confinement to indiscriminate war against presumed enemies, it is impossible ""to recognize the Islamic–religion, society, culture, history or politics–as lived and experienced by Muslims through the ages."" The modern Islamists, Ahmad concludes, are ""concerned with power, not with the soul; with the mobilization of people for political purposes rather than with sharing and alleviating their sufferings and aspirations. Theirs is a very limited and time-bound political agenda."" What has made matters worse is that similar distortions and zealotry occur in the ""Jewish"" and ""Christian"" universes of discourse.


It was Conrad, more powerfully than any of his readers at the end of the nineteenth century could have imagined, who understood that the distinctions between civilized London and ""the heart of darkness"" quickly collapsed in extreme situations, and that the heights of European civilization could instantaneously fall into the most barbarous practices without preparation or transition. And it was Conrad also, in The Secret Agent (1907), who described terrorism’s affinity for abstractions like ""pure science"" (and by extension for ""Islam"" or ""the West""), as well as the terrorist’s ultimate moral degradation.

For there are closer ties between apparently warring civilizations than most of us would like to believe; both Freud and Nietzsche showed how the traffic across carefully maintained, even policed boundaries moves with often terrifying ease. But then such fluid ideas, full of ambiguity and skepticism about notions that we hold on to, scarcely furnish us with suitable, practical guidelines for situations such as the one we face now. Hence the altogether more reassuring battle orders (a crusade, good versus evil, freedom against fear, etc.) drawn out of Huntington’s alleged opposition between Islam and the West, from which official discourse drew its vocabulary in the first days after the September 11 attacks. There’s since been a noticeable de-escalation in that discourse, but to judge from the steady amount of hate speech and actions, plus reports of law enforcement efforts directed against Arabs, Muslims and Indians all over the country, the paradigm stays on.

One further reason for its persistence is the increased presence of Muslims all over Europe and the United States. Think of the populations today of France, Italy, Germany, Spain, Britain, America, even Sweden, and you must concede that Islam is no longer on the fringes of the West but at its center. But what is so threatening about that presence? Buried in the collective culture are memories of the first great Arab-Islamic conquests, which began in the seventh century and which, as the celebrated Belgian historian Henri Pirenne wrote in his landmark book Mohammed and Charlemagne (1939), shattered once and for all the ancient unity of the Mediterranean, destroyed the Christian-Roman synthesis and gave rise to a new civilization dominated by northern powers (Germany and Carolingian France) whose mission, he seemed to be saying, is to resume defense of the ""West"" against its historical-cultural enemies. What Pirenne left out, alas, is that in the creation of this new line of defense the West drew on the humanism, science, philosophy, sociology and historiography of Islam, which had already interposed itself between Charlemagne’s world and classical antiquity. Islam is inside from the start, as even Dante, great enemy of Mohammed, had to concede when he placed the Prophet at the very heart of his Inferno.

Then there is the persisting legacy of monotheism itself, the Abrahamic religions, as Louis Massignon aptly called them. Beginning with Judaism and Christianity, each is a successor haunted by what came before; for Muslims, Islam fulfills and ends the line of prophecy. There is still no decent history or demystification of the many-sided contest among these three followers–not one of them by any means a monolithic, unified camp–of the most jealous of all gods, even though the bloody modern convergence on Palestine furnishes a rich secular instance of what has been so tragically irreconcilable about them. Not surprisingly, then, Muslims and Christians speak readily of crusades and jihads, both of them eliding the Judaic presence with often sublime insouciance. Such an agenda, says Eqbal Ahmad, is ""very reassuring to the men and women who are stranded in the middle of the ford, between the deep waters of tradition and modernity.""

But we are all swimming in those waters, Westerners and Muslims and others alike. And since the waters are part of the ocean of history, trying to plow or divide them with barriers is futile. These are tense times, but it is better to think in terms of powerful and powerless communities, the secular politics of reason and ignorance, and universal principles of justice and injustice, than to wander off in search of vast abstractions that may give momentary satisfaction but little self-knowledge or informed analysis. ""The Clash of Civilizations"" thesis is a gimmick like ""The War of the Worlds,"" better for reinforcing defensive self-pride than for critical understanding of the bewildering interdependence of our time."

1. Summary of the Proposed Project
Social impact organizations often grapple with “wicked problems”––deeply complex challenges that are difficult to define and even harder to solve. These issues demand innovative thinking and strong collaboration skills. However, many social projects rely on volunteers or part-time staff who don’t receive formal training in problem-solving methods or team collaboration. Our project aims to address this gap by offering workshops and a readily accessible “toolbox” that helps volunteers develop two critical skills: (1) collaboration within diverse teams, and (2) creative, “outside-the-box” thinking.
We envision a cost-effective/free, adaptable program that organizations can use to upskill volunteers, even with limited budgets and high turnover of workers. By equipping volunteers with foundational methods for tackling wicked problems, we aspire to boost the impact of social projects and create a lasting benefit for both volunteers and the communities they serve.

2. Problem & Design Challenge
Problem Statement
In the social impact arena, volunteers and part-time staff frequently face intricate, interconnected challenges—so-called wicked problems. These volunteers often lack structured training in two especially relevant areas: team collaboration and creative problem-solving. Given tight budgets and rotating personnel, many organizations struggle to consistently offer high-quality skill-building opportunities.
Design Challenge
We aim to design a workshop series/single and an accompanying “toolbox” that anyone—regardless of experience level—can pick up and use to strengthen collaboration and creative thinking. The workshop would introduce hands-on exercises for tackling real-world problems in a team setting. The toolbox would serve as a guide that organizations can adapt over time and reuse with new cohorts of volunteers. Our hope is that, by improving these two skill areas, volunteers can more effectively address complex social challenges, not just in their current volunteer job but also in future occupations. We are especially aiming for young and inexperienced workers as there is the most space for improvement.



3. Secondary Research & Insights
Initially, we explored broad research on cross-sector collaboration, gamification, and workforce reskilling to identify which competencies are most critical in solving modern, multifaceted problems. As our focus narrowed, we investigated the concept of wicked problems, which scholars like Rittel & Webber (1973) define as issues without definitive solutions, often requiring iterative approaches and collaboration among diverse stakeholders. According to Brown et al. (2010) and Kawa et al. (2021), such problems are on the rise, influenced by globalization and the rapid pace of technological and societal change.
Crucially, we found that many organizations struggle with harnessing diversity for innovation. Deloitte’s research (2016) and Bourke (2016) suggest that cognitively diverse teams are more innovative, yet they often lack practical frameworks to collaborate effectively. This gap is evident not only in large companies but also in smaller social ventures. Several reports (e.g., Woolley et al., 2010; van Knippenberg, 2013; Wang, 2019) highlight that productive collaboration requires deliberate training, mindset shifts, and clear facilitation methods.
The LSX model (Brookings, 2024) was a very big inspiration. It emphasizes that solving wicked problems demands mental agility, openness to other viewpoints, and systematic approaches to gathering insights. We also spoke with individuals who support social impact initiatives, including practitioners experienced in training volunteers. They confirmed that there is a real need for programs that help inexperienced or rotating volunteers develop advanced problem-solving and collaboration skills.

4. Primary Research
To validate these findings, we conducted interviews with:
Staff at a Cultural Center (CCB): They noted the growing complexity of their work and stressed that volunteers rarely receive structured problem-solving support. While they do run bi-annual training sessions, these focus more on operational tasks than on creative collaboration or adaptability.
Social Impact Project Coordinators: Several coordinators observed that volunteers often become discouraged when faced with open-ended problems. They noted that short, immersive skill-building sessions could boost confidence and overall effectiveness.
Experts in the LSX Approach: Conversations with contributors to the LSX model underscored the importance of team diversity and mental agility. They encouraged focusing on practical, scenario-based learning to help volunteers transfer lessons to real challenges.
These interviews confirmed that many volunteers feel underprepared for the unpredictability of social impact work. They also clarified our design direction: a hands-on, replicable workshop and toolbox, tested and refined with actual social projects.

5. Proposed Solution
Workshops
We plan to pilot an interactive session that introduces foundational collaboration techniques or creative thinking exercises. We are thinking about tools like role-playing, brainstorming games, and “instant feedback” checkpoints will help volunteers practice flexible thinking and deliberate teamwork. 
Toolbox
Alongside the workshops, we will develop a concise, user-friendly “toolbox.” This will include checklists, mini-guides, and simple exercises that organizations can deploy well after the formal workshop ends. The intent is for any project coordinator or new volunteer to open the toolbox and quickly adapt an activity or approach to a current challenge.

Summary of the proposed solution/project
The proposed solution addresses the growing challenge of fostering intergenerational connections, through a collaborative documentary project. The project creates a meaningful platform for collaboration and connection, combining the elders' desire to share their stories, with creative efforts of youth. This approach would not only build cohesion but also address broader societal needs. The idea is to preserve Lisbon’s cultural history, by documenting the personal stories from past neighborhoods that had a present sense of community. It acknowledges the importance of both groups having the opportunity to give and receive through the connection, creating a stronger incentive to engage with the project. By producing something meaningful, they develop a sense of purpose and a deeper connection to their neighborhood. Furthermore, it empowers youth in low-income neighborhoods with practical and interpersonal skills. By sharing their lived experiences, elders contribute to fostering understanding while also feeling connected and heard – this reduces the common sentiment among many elders that their perspectives are overlooked by younger generations. This approach aligns with the research insights showing that shared activities and common goals enhance connection, and thus enhance well-being and decrease feelings of isolation for both groups. 
The project is designed as a participatory initiative, where both groups contribute in shaping the project and its outcome. Ideally, it will result in a community event where the output is shared, with externals which could lead to a campaign raising awareness. The project draws inspiration from successful initiatives like GER-AÇÕES and Pedalar Sem Idade, incorporating lessons on community building through localised, collaborative efforts. By focusing on the connections that unite rather than divide generations, the project lays the groundwork for sustainable and meaningful intergenerational relationships.
Problem & Design Challenge
An individual’s feeling of purpose and connection is heavily affected by their interpersonal relations and sense of community. With a general trend of decreasing mental health among adolescents, and increasing loneliness and isolation amongst elders. Building connections across generations can increase a sense of community and well-being for participants - helping to decrease loneliness, a subjective feeling where one's social relationships are lacking in quality and/or quantity. Elders and adolescents are two of the groups with the least connection between  zeach other. However, we believe that both parts have something to contribute and gain from an intergenerational connection. Thus, our question; How might we help young and elderly people in Lisbon build a connection over a shared purpose, enhancing and continuing a sense of community?
Research Findings
Based on our initial assumptions, we believed the lack of community stemmed from loneliness. To explore this, we conducted secondary research on loneliness among the elderly and youth in Lisbon, using data from academic studies, reports, and organisational insights. However, this assumption evolved as research progressed. Our research examined statistical data, cultural nuances, and community initiatives. While it provided a broad overview, it was not Lisbon-specific and focused more on intergenerational connections between elders and children, rather than adolescents. 
Loneliness among Lisbon's youth is a significant concern, with 20–30% of individuals aged 18–24 reporting feelings of isolation (EU, 2023). Factors contributing to this include overuse of technology, which fosters unrealistic comparisons and fear of missing out, urbanisation-driven displacement of families to the suburbs, and academic and employment pressures that exacerbate stress. When looking at loneliness among Lisbon' elders, it is linked to reduced family interaction due to smaller households and emigration of younger generations. Furthermore, issues include mobility barriers posed by Lisbon’s hilly streets, tourism-focused urbanisation, and cultural disconnection stemming from limited engagement with technology. Studies highlight that loneliness correlates with reduced quality of life (Karger, 2021).
Existing initiatives addressing loneliness provide valuable insights. For example,  GER-AÇÕES fosters intergenerational solidarity through community labs, Pedalar Sem Idade connects elderly residents with youth through cycling activities, and Meo’s Partilha Casa promotes housing solutions that bridge generational gaps. These programs demonstrate the potential of intergenerational engagement to reduce loneliness and build community resilience (World Cities Culture Forum, n.d). Looking at GER-AÇÕES, an organisation that aims to address the same issue as our team. Notably overcoming the initial resistance to participation, which could teach us on how the people in Lisbon function on a cultural and social aspect. Bridging the generational gap is also a pertinent challenge which they face, seeing how such organisations navigate these challenges would serve as a source of inspiration for our project. 
Recognising the inability of the secondary research to identify shared interest between elders and youth, we reconsidered our approach to primary research. We visited Pedro at Dona Ajuda, who introduced us to various initiatives. Volunteering at Dona Ajuda emerged as an essential social meeting space for many elderly individuals, providing structure and purpose that are often lost after retirement. During discussions, we explored ideas for fostering a sense of community by connecting youth and elderly through the NGO. Pedro expressed openness to collaboration, making Dona Ajuda a vital potential stakeholder for its deep ties to the community.
We interviewed Ana Maria, a psychology professor at Forward College, who discussed the benefits of similar projects involving children and elders, which have successfully boosted self-esteem in both groups. However, bridging the gap between adolescents and elders is challenging, as adolescents often focus on themselves and struggle to see the value in what elders offer. Ana Maria suggested that finding common ground, where both groups can contribute meaningfully and give value, is key. She emphasised the importance of involving and empathising with all participants to create a meaningful impact in Lisbon’s community: “It’s not a project that’s made to look good; it’s a project to make the people involved feel good.”
We met with Raquel from the Aga Khan Foundation, who has extensive experience in community-building projects, particularly in underserved neighborhoods. She mentioned the often-overlooked history of Lisbon’s slums, neighborhoods with strong sense of connection throughout the community, and how these communities were relocated to social housing, breaking up the community. This history is largely unknown to younger generations, contributing to a disconnect and lack of mutual understanding between youth and elders. Raquel also introduced us to Associação Per 11, located on the outskirts of Lisbon. Our visit to Per 11 in Santa Clara, managed by Mauro Wah, reinforced these insights as we saw how both youth and elders actively participated in communal projects. It exemplified the intergenerational engagement Raquel had mentioned—how such initiatives can thrive in small, close-knit communities. 
Furthermore, we conducted interviews with four elderly individuals in Benfica, asking about loneliness in Lisbon and their interest in participating in our project. These interviews challenged our initial assumptions. For example, while we initially believed loneliness stemmed from a lack of connection between youth and the elderly, one interviewee shared that they saw loneliness as a lack of personal engagement. This feedback prompted us to rethink certain elements of our project to better align with the diverse experiences of the elderly. To gather more data on the elderly perspective, we reached out to the Senior University (UITI) and are awaiting a response.

When we conducted primary research, we noticed differences compared to our secondary research. Unless explicitly asked, few of our stakeholders referred to loneliness as the main holdback of sense of community. Loneliness was instead a symptom of deeper rooted issues. Thus, our scope shifted towards investigating these problems we did not predict. Firstly, elders losing the social place of work means they have to make a continuous effort to socialise. This can result in loneliness, but does not necessarily guarantee it. Thus, the elderly are in need of opportunities gather. We also noticed a general shift away from closed-knit communities, with less intergenerational homes and the splitting up of Lisbon’s old slums. Considering these insights, our design challenge was reframed from focusing mainly on how to decrease loneliness, to moving towards “re”-building a sense of community.
Both Ana Maria and Mauro spoke about the importance of finding a shared interest to unite elders and youth. Shared activities provide youth and elderly with purpose and a chance to learn from each other, where both groups gain and contribute. Ana Maria emphasised the psychological background for a mutually beneficial connection; both group’s needs must be met. Youth need to be in control of the process, keeping their independence intact, to be engaged. Another insight is that youth like to create, and elders like to share experiences - two different interests that can be well combined.
Furthermore, localised approaches are essential, giving the unique dynamics of different communities. Community-centred issues in some neighborhoods are rooted in lack of opportunity for natural meeting places, while elderly-dense areas like Alfama, require solutions tailored to mobility and accessibility. Participatory engagements stand out as a central theme, from elders having to make the choice of being social, to co-designing approaches ensuring that solutions resonate with and are embraced by both target groups. 
In conclusion, these insights prompted us to shift our focus toward the communal dimension. This perspective highlights the relevance of an intergenerational project, which serves as a means to blend the experience of older generations with the energy of younger ones. By fostering close collaboration with target groups and stakeholders with knowledge of the specific neighborhoods, the initiative can remain deeply rooted in the community, ensuring relevance and sustainability.
Proposed solution
Our proposed solution to bridge the intergenerational gap in Lisbon is a collaborative docuseries. This initiative will document the personal stories of elders from Lisbon’s slums, with youth acting as filmmakers and creative directors. As Raquel mentioned, the Aga Khan Foundation uses a similar approach, which not only brings people together but also preserves Lisbon’s cultural heritage. By capturing stories from neighborhoods where generations once lived side by side, we ensure that this rich history is kept alive. This approach responds to key needs identified in our research, such as elders' desire to share their history and youth's need for engaging, purposeful activities that grant them control and ownership. Intergenerational collaboration offers mutual benefits, including improved self-esteem, mental health, and a sense of purpose. Projects like those by Associação Moradores Per 11, which combine traditional crafts with modern design, demonstrate how creative efforts can bridge generational divides.
Empowering youth to lead the production process ensures engagement while allowing them to learn about Lisbon's history from elders. In turn, elders gain a platform fostering their visibility. Sharing the history of Lisbon’s slums highlights an often-overlooked chapter, giving youth a deeper understanding of past communities’ resilience and acknowledging the elders' contributions. Involving both groups in co-designing the project, as suggested by Raquel, ensures meaningful participation and mutual buy-in. To confirm our assumptions and align the project with youth interests, we will conduct a survey to validate their needs and motivations. This initiative addresses three dimensions of change:
Social Cohesion: The docuseries creates a shared community space for intergenerational interaction, helping reduce isolation and build relationships between youth and elders. Through collaboration, both groups strengthen community ties and combat loneliness.
Cultural Preservation: Lisbon’s elderly hold valuable cultural knowledge at risk of being lost. Documenting their stories, particularly about the slums, social housing, and urbanisation, preserves this history digitally and makes it accessible to future generations, connecting them to their roots.
Personal Empowerment: Both groups gain practical skills and a sense of accomplishment. Youth develop technological, organisational, and creative abilities, while elders gain confidence. This mutual exchange fosters an inclusive society where everyone feels valued.
By addressing shared interests and aligning the project with the strengths and needs of each group, the docuseries creates a model for sustainable, intergenerational collaboration. It builds on lessons from successful initiatives like GER-AÇÕES, which uses libraries as hubs for community engagement, and Pedalar Sem Idade, which addresses elders’ isolation through mobility issues. Additionally, it innovatively combines historical storytelling with modern media production, offering a unique approach to narrative intergenerational community building.

"differences between 'goals', 'output', 'outcome' and 'activity'?"
"“War is not fought between man and man but between states” (Rousseau, 2011). A central aspect of the philosophy Rousseau presents in his works, a staunch critic of what society has brought man. The general will, according to Rousseau, describes what humans should be and act like, a rational collective agreement setting personal needs aside and advocating for the collective good (Falaky 2016). This concept refers to human cooperation in a way that could be seen as a framework for international cooperations due to the motivation to pursue the collective good. The concept of general will according to Rousseau can be seen as a theoretical framework for international relations and a promoter of peace among states rather than promoting inter state dependency causing conflict although this potentially clashes with what Rousseau advocated for in his works. 

The general will is a concept that is at the core of Rousseau's philosophy, the concept advocates for the promotion of the collective good rather than pursuing personal agendas. Rousseau therefore suggests that preserving the general in the international community is the most effective way to ensure peace and prevent conflict (Blachet 2002). This idea is further supported by the work “perpetual peace” by Kant. Kant envisions in his work an assembly of united federal states that are governed by rational laws rather than power struggles. His work was produced with influence from Rousseau’s work in the context of 18th century Europe, showcasing the aspiration already seen at that time that one might argue has come to fruition in current times. The European Union represents this execution of Kant’s aspiration. This union is now governed by a central body and has overarching laws that take precedence over state laws. The union has preserved peace in the member states for the past decades, which used to be unheard of less than a century prior, as the region has historically been continuously taunted with conflict. Achieving this aspiration of pursuing the common good that the European Union represents, shows parallels with Rousseau’s general will. The source of the European Union is to be found in its need for cooperation in the form of open essential resource trading reducing dependency. 

A central aspect that Rousseau also argues for is that dependency between all states is a source of conflict (Blanchet 2002), thus replacing this dependency with cooperation would remove factors that lead to conflict as seen in the EU. The reason for dependency causing conflict is that there will always be inegality between the weaker and stronger states which will inevitably lead to friction. This concept can be extrapolated to a stag hunt as described by (Waltz 1954), the stag hunt describes that with cooperation a stag could be caught but that if a hare runs by, one of them could take the hare for themselves and the rest will not get anything. This illustration refers to the pursuit of self interest or “amour-propre” referring to the inherent self-interest present in international relations. This interpretation by Waltz of Rousseau's work is contested as many other academics argue that this is an oversimplification of what was written. Rousseau was not pessimistic about international relations but that the current systems are not working and would not result in peace (Carmen 2018), implying that functioning institutions could result in fostering peace through better cooperation. This interpretation of Rousseau's work that advocates cooperation as a medicine for peace is contested by other scholars due to what Rousseau simultaneously advocates for in his work.

During his life Rousseau has been involved in a few notable endeavors concerning the preservation of states and how they should act in the international realm, notably by writing the constitutions of Corsica and later Poland. In both constitutions Rousseau argues for autarchy (Kedouri 1960) as a means to guarantee peace. These countries would essentially be agrarian states that would be self-sufficient and also be unattractive enough for other states to invade. Completely eliminating the aspect of cooperation as a core aspect of a state's way of functioning. This is not the only contradicting aspect as his “social contract” and also argues that humans were better off before society and are now corrupted, clearly does not extend to the international realm (Falaky 2016). Monarchs were made to legislate and thus did not take into account the international realm with this aspect as their main interest would be to preserve their own states. A third point would be that Rousseau argues more in favour of something that resembles aggressive nationalism by forcing people to be free in his works which would be more in line with positive freedom (Talmon (1962))

Taking into account the main principles Rousseau has laid out in his works it is difficult to say what his exact stance is on aspects of international relations. On one hand the general will cna be seen as a theoretical framework of international cooperation, and thus a solution to peace. This theory is then also supported by Kant’s work of perpetual peace and as example the European Union, but simultaneously he is a staunch critic. The criticism stems in what he says which is in contrast in what he does in regards to the constitution of corsica and notably Poland, which argues for no international cooperation and full autarchy, a basis for what one might consider nationalism. Rousseau’ work showcases the potential for intnerational cooperation as a means to achieve peace but at the same time it limitations have to be recognised and handled with realistically.   how good is this essay for first year LSE in IPT xlass"

Our initial assumptions about the problem we were tackelign where 
That people let go of there outside of work interest, probably due to lack of time or because it does not seem to contribute. A lawyer would probably not continue reading philosophie even tough it was his hobby before he had a full time job.
We taught that a lawyer rarely meets someone in marketing or an engineer which would lead to a lack of perspectives.
Assumption is that white collar worker are over specialized, what we meant by that is that workers are very good in one specific task but miss a different perepecticve 
Assumptions are not enough to build a whole project. So lets talk about our research: 
We started with qualitative secondráry research which was for thies topics actually not a easy task. Thats why we then also did a interview with a expert of the field who is doing research around new work.  His point of view combined with our secondary research lead us to the following problems todays worker in lisbon could have:

Next slide 

From the described research we could proof that some of our assumptions were true and create the following problems: 

-the neglection of outside of work interest and the lack of exposure to new ideas and perspectives, by talking about new topics for example, leads to less inspiration
- a diversion between silos  limited communication disrupts the understanding of each other which leads to polarization and that harms democracy 
- and the last bigger problem we found was that the first 2 just described problem can in the bigger picture, harm mental health. Risk of uninspired work can be emotional exhaustion and burn outs. 

The first assumed problems are not related to any specific kind of work, considering our research we decided that we want to focus on white color workers, workes that work more with there had then hands. To see some real data to continue testing our problem, we conducted a survey in a office area in lisbon. 

Next slide 

In this survey, some of our assumption where proven, for example that a big majority is interested in meeting people with different beliefs and perspectives, but that nearly a quartered havent had such conversations in quit a while. 

Other assumtions where not proven, even tough full time workers are bussy, they still have enough time to purse outside of work interests.

The survey, further secondary research and  a lot of thinking let us to a turning point:

We let the problems of  polarization and mental health for a team next year and decided to focus on the problem lack of inspiration or even more focused, the lack of cross silo communication."

WORLD POLITICS is entering a new phase, and intellectuals have
not hesitated to proliferate visions of what it will be—the end of history, the return of traditional rivalries between nation states, and the
decline of the nation state from the conflicting pulls of tribalism and
globalism, among others. Each of these visions catches aspects of the
emerging reality. Yet they all miss a crucial, indeed a central, aspect
of what global politics is likely to be in the coming years.
It is my hypothesis that the fundamental source of conflict in this
new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic.
The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of
conflict will be cultural. Nation states will remain the most powerful
actors in world affairs, but the principal conflicts of global politics will
occur between nations and groups of different civilizations. The clash
of civilizations will dominate global politics. The fault lines between
civilizations will be the battle lines of the future.

The Clash of Civilizations?
princes—emperors, absolute monarchs and constitutional monarchs
attempting to expand their bureaucracies, their armies, their mercantilist economic strength and, most important, the territory they
ruled. In the process they created nation states, and beginning with
the French Revolution the principal lines of conflict were between
nations rather than princes. In 1793, as R. R. Palmer put it, ""The wars
of kings were over; the wars of peoples had begun."" This nineteenthcentury pattern lasted until the end of World War I. Then, as a result
of the Russian Revolution and the reaction against it, the conflict of
nations yielded to the conflict of ideologies, first among communism,
fascism-Nazism and liberal democracy, and then between communism and liberal democracy. During the Cold War, this latter conflict
became embodied in the struggle between the two superpowers, neither of which was a nation state in the classical European sense and
each of which defined its identity in terms of its ideology.
These conflicts between princes, nation states and ideologies were
primarily conflicts within Western civilization, ""Western civil wars,""
as William Lind has labeled them. This was as true of the Cold War
as it was of the world wars and the earlier wars of the seventeenth,
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. With the end of the Cold War,
international politics moves out of its Western phase, and its centerpiece becomes the interaction between the West and non-Western
civilizations and among non-Western civilizations. In the politics of
civilizations, the peoples and governments of non-Western civilizations no longer remain the objects of history as targets of Western
colonialism but join the West as movers and shapers of history.
THE NATURE OF CIVILIZATIONS
DURING THE COLD WAR the world was divided into the First,
Second and Third Worlds. Those divisions are no longer relevant. It
is far more meaningful now to group countries not in terms of their
political or economic systems or in terms of their level of economic
development but rather in terms of their culture and civilization.
What do we mean when we talk of a civilization? A civilization is
a cultural entity. Villages, regions, ethnic groups, nationalities, reliFOREIGN AFFAIRS > Summer i993
Samuel P. Huntington
gious groups, all have distinct cultures at different levels of cultural
heterogeneity. The culture of a village in southern Italy may be different from that of a village in northern Italy, but both will share in a
common Italian culture that distinguishes them from German villages. European communities, in turn, will share cultural features that
distinguish them from Arab or Chinese communities. Arabs,
Chinese and Westerners, however, are not part of any broader cultural entity. They constitute civilizations. A civilization is thus the
highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural
identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from
other species. It is defined both by common objective elements, such
as language, history, religion, customs, institutions, and by the subjective self-identification of people. People have levels of identity: a
resident of Rome may define himself with varying degrees of intensity as a Roman, an Italian, a Catholic, a Christian, a European, a
Westerner. The civilization to which he belongs is the broadest level
of identification with which he intensely identifies. People can and
do redefine their identities and, as a result, the composition and
boundaries of civilizations change.
Civilizations may involve a large number of people, as with China
(""a civilization pretending to be a state,"" as Lucian Pye put it), or a
very small number of people, such as the Anglophone Caribbean. A
civilization may include several nation states, as is the case with
Western, Latin American and Arab civilizations, or only one, as is the
case with Japanese civilization. Civilizations obviously blend and
overlap, and may include subcivilizations. Western civilization has
two major variants, European and North American, and Islam has its
Arab, Turkic and Malay subdivisions. Civilizations are nonetheless
meaningful entities, and while the lines between them are seldom
sharp, they are real. Civilizations are dynamic; they rise and fall; they
divide and merge. And, as any student of history knows, civilizations
disappear and are buried in the sands of time.
Westerners tend to think of nation states as the principal actors in
global affairs. They have been that, however, for only a few centuries.
The broader reaches of human history have been the history of civi-

lizations. In A Study of History, Arnold Toynbee identified 21 major
civilizations; only six of them exist in the contemporary world.
WHY CIVILIZATIONS WILL CLASH
CIVILIZATION IDENTITY will be increasingly important in the
future, and the world will be shaped in large measure by the interactions among seven or eight major civilizations. These include
Western, Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu, Slavic-Orthodox,
Latin American and possibly African civilization. The most important conflicts of the future will occur along the cultural fault lines separating these civilizations from one another.
Why will this be the case?
First, differences among civilizations are not only real; they are
basic. Civilizations are differentiated from each other by history, language, culture, tradition and, most important,
religion. The people of different civilizations nThe conflicts of the

ties, liberty and authority, equality and hierarchy. These differences are the product of centuries. They will not
soon disappear. They are far more fundamental than differences
among political ideologies and political regimes. Differences do not
necessarily mean conflict, and conflict does not necessarily mean violence. Over the centuries, however, differences among civilizations
have generated the most prolonged and the most violent conflicts.
Second, the world is becoming a smaller place. The interactions
between peoples of different civilizations are increasing; these
increasing interactions intensify civilization consciousness and
awareness of differences between civilizations and commonalities
within civilizations. North African immigration to France generates
hostility among Frenchmen and at the same time increased receptivity to immigration by ""good"" European Catholic Poles. Americans

react far more negatively to Japanese investment than to larger investments from Canada and European countries. Similarly, as Donald
Horowitz has pointed out, ""An Ibo may be ... an Owerri Ibo or an
Onitsha Ibo in what was the Eastern region of Nigeria. In Lagos, he
is simply an Ibo. In London, he is a Nigerian. In New York, he is an
African."" The interactions among peoples of different civilizations
enhance the civilization-consciousness of people that, in turn, invigorates differences and animosities stretching or thought to stretch
back deep into history.
Third, the processes of economic modernization and social change
throughout the world are separating people from longstanding local
identities. They also weaken the nation state as a source of identity.
In much of the world religion has moved in to fill this gap, often in
the form of movements that are labeled ""fundamentalist."" Such
movements are found in Western Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism
and Hinduism, as well as in Islam. In most countries and most religions the people active in fundamentalist movements are young, college-educated, middle-class technicians, professionals and business
persons. The ""unsecularization of the world,"" George Weigel has
remarked, ""is one of the dominant social facts of life in the late twentieth century."" The revival of religion, ""la revanche de Dieu,"" as Gilles
Kepel labeled it, provides a basis for identity and commitment that
transcends national boundaries and unites civilizations.
Fourth, the growth of civilization-consciousness is enhanced by
the dual role of the West. On the one hand, the West is at a peak of
power. At the same time, however, and perhaps as a result, a return
to the roots phenomenon is occurring among non-Western civilizations. Increasingly one hears references to trends toward a turning
inward and ""Asianization"" in Japan, the end of the Nehru legacy and
the ""Hinduization"" of India, the failure of Western ideas of socialism
and nationalism and hence ""re-Islamization"" of the Middle East, and
now a debate over Westernization versus Russianization in Boris
Yeltsins country. A West at the peak of its power confronts nonWests that increasingly have the desire, the will and the resources to
shape the world in non-Western ways.
In the past, the elites of non-Western societies were usually the
[26] FOREIGN AFFAIRS • Volume72 No.j
The Clash of Civilizations?
people who were most involved with the West, had been educated at
Oxford, the Sorbonne or Sandhurst, and had absorbed Western attitudes and values. At the same time, the populace in non-Western
countries often remained deeply imbued with the indigenous culture.
Now, however, these relationships are being reversed. A deWesternization and indigenization of elites is occurring in many nonWestern countries at the same time that Western, usually American,
cultures, styles and habits become more popular among the mass of
the people.
Fifth, cultural characteristics and differences are less mutable and
hence less easily compromised and resolved than political and economic ones. In the former Soviet Union, communists can become
democrats, the rich can become poor and the poor rich, but Russians
cannot become Estonians and Azeris cannot become Armenians. In
class and ideological conflicts, the key question was ""Which side are
you on?"" and people could and did choose sides and change sides. In
conflicts between civilizations, the question is ""What are you?"" That
is a given that cannot be changed. And as we know, from Bosnia to
the Caucasus to the Sudan, the wrong answer to that question can
mean a bullet in the head. Even more than ethnicity, religion discriminates sharply and exclusively among people. A person can be
half-French and half-Arab and simultaneously even a citizen of two
countries. It is more difficult to be half-Catholic and half-Muslim.
Finally, economic regionalism is increasing. The proportions of
total trade that were intraregional rose between 1980 and 1989 from
51 percent to 59 percent in Europe, 33 percent to 37 percent in East
Asia, and 32 percent to 36 percent in North America. The importance
of regional economic blocs is likely to continue to increase in the
future. On the one hand, successful economic regionalism will reinforce civilization-consciousness. On the other hand, economic
regionalism may succeed only when it is rooted in a common civilization. The European Community rests on the shared foundation
of European culture and Western Christianity. The success of the
North American Free Trade Area depends on the convergence now
underway of Mexican, Canadian and American cultures. Japan, in
contrast, faces difficulties in creating a comparable economic entity

in East Asia because Japan is a society and civilization unique to itself.
However strong the trade and investment links Japan may develop
with other East Asian countries, its cultural differences with those
countries inhibit and perhaps preclude its promoting regional economic integration like that in Europe and North America.
Common culture, in contrast, is clearly facilitating the rapid
expansion of the economic relations between the People s Republic of
China and Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and the overseas Chinese
communities in other Asian countries. With the Cold War over, cultural commonalities increasingly overcome ideological differences,
and mainland China and Taiwan move closer together. If cultural
commonality is a prerequisite for economic integration, the principal
East Asian economic bloc of the future is likely to be centered on
China. This bloc is, in fact, already coming into existence. As Murray
Weidenbaum has observed,
Despite the current Japanese dominance of the region, the Chinese-based
economy of Asia is rapidly emerging as a new epicenter for industry, commerce and finance. This strategic area contains substantial amounts of technology and manufacturing capability (Taiwan), outstanding entrepreneurial,
marketing and services acumen (Hong Kong), a fine communications network (Singapore), a tremendous pool of financial capital (all three), and very
large endowments of land, resources and labor (mainland China).... From
Guangzhou to Singapore, from Kuala Lumpur to Manila, this influential network1—often based on extensions of the traditional clans—has been described
as the backbone of the East Asian economy.1
Culture and religion also form the basis of the Economic
Cooperation Organization, which brings together ten non-Arab
Muslim countries: Iran, Pakistan, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tadjikistan, Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. One impetus to the revival and expansion of this organization,
founded originally in the 19608 by Turkey, Pakistan and Iran, is the
realization by the leaders of several of these countries that they had
no chance of admission to the European Community. Similarly,

on common cultural foundations. Efforts to build a broader
Caribbean-Central American economic entity bridging the AngloLatin divide, however, have to date failed.
As people define their identity in ethnic and religious terms, they
are likely to see an ""us"" versus ""them"" relation existing between themselves and people of different ethnicity or religion. The end of ideologically defined states in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union permits traditional ethnic identities and animosities to come
to the fore. Differences in culture and religion create differences over
policy issues, ranging from human rights to immigration to trade and
commerce to the environment. Geographical propinquity gives rise
to conflicting territorial claims from Bosnia to Mindanao. Most
important, the efforts of the West to promote its values of democracy and liberalism as universal values, to maintain its military predominance and to advance its economic interests engender
countering responses from other civilizations. Decreasingly able to
mobilize support and form coalitions on the basis of ideology, governments and groups will increasingly attempt to mobilize support by
appealing to common religion and civilization identity.
The clash of civilizations thus occurs at two levels. At the microlevel, adjacent groups along the fault lines between civilizations
struggle, often violently, over the control of territory and each other.
At the macro-level, states from different civilizations compete for relative military and economic power, struggle over the control of international institutions and third parties, and competitively promote
their particular political and religious values."
