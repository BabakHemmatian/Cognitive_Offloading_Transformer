"what would you say is bad or should be changed about this systematic literature review: The Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Risk-Taking and Moral Decision-Making in Adults
Introduction
Sleep deprivation is a widely researched psychological and physiological phenomenon that occurs when an individual experiences insufficient sleep, leading to cognitive and emotional impairments (Durmer & Dinges, 2005). Research in cognitive psychology and neuroscience has demonstrated that sleep is essential for maintaining executive function, impulse control, and ethical reasoning (Stickgold & Walker, 2007). Given the increasing prevalence of sleep deprivation due to modern lifestyles, it is crucial to understand its impact on key cognitive functions, particularly those associated with decision-making.
Decision-making often involves evaluating risks and moral dilemmas, both of which rely on higher-order cognitive processing. Sleep plays a pivotal role in regulating these processes by maintaining the balance between intuitive and analytical decision-making systems (Evans & Stanovich, 2013). The dual-process theory suggests that individuals rely on both System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (analytical) processing, with sleep deprivation weakening System 2, leading to increased reliance on impulsive, emotion-driven decision-making (Whitney et al., 2015). This impairment may result in heightened risk-taking behaviors and compromised moral reasoning, posing significant implications for various professional and social contexts.
While previous studies have explored the consequences of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance, a systematic synthesis of its effects on risk-taking behavior and moral decision-making in adults is lacking. This review aims to fill this gap by systematically evaluating empirical research on the topic. By doing so, it seeks to determine the extent to which sleep loss influences these cognitive functions and whether these effects are consistent across different populations.
Method
This systematic literature review was conducted following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines (Page et al., 2021), ensuring a structured and replicable approach. A comprehensive search was performed across three major academic databases: PubMed, PsycInfo, and ResearchGate. These databases were selected due to their extensive coverage of peer-reviewed research in psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral sciences. The objective was to identify studies examining the effects of sleep deprivation on risk-taking behavior and moral decision-making in adults.
Search Strategy
A predefined search strategy was implemented using Boolean operators to refine results effectively. The search terms included:
(""sleep deprivation"" OR ""sleep restriction"" OR ""insufficient sleep"") AND (""risk-taking"" OR ""decision-making"" OR ""moral judgment"" OR ""impulsivity"")
Filters were applied to restrict the search to peer-reviewed empirical studies published between 2009 and 2024 in English-language journals. Studies focusing on children, general sleep patterns without a deprivation component, or unrelated cognitive domains were excluded.
Study Selection Process
The search initially yielded 162 studies. Following the removal of 42 duplicates, 120 studies remained for screening. Title and abstract screening excluded 62 studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria. The remaining 58 studies underwent full-text review, where 48 studies were excluded due to methodological limitations or lack of relevance. Ultimately, 10 studies met all criteria and were included in the final review.
A PRISMA flow diagram (Appendix B) illustrates the study selection process, detailing the number of records identified, screened, excluded, and included in the review.

Results
The final selection of 10 studies provided insight into the relationship between sleep deprivation, risk-taking behavior, and moral decision-making. This section presents a synthesis of the key findings from these studies, highlighting trends, similarities, and discrepancies in the results.
Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Risk-Taking Behavior
Several studies demonstrated a significant relationship between sleep deprivation and increased risk-taking tendencies. Wei et al. (2025) found that sleep-deprived individuals exhibited a heightened propensity for risk-taking, particularly in tasks requiring probabilistic reasoning and long-term reward evaluation. Similarly, Killgore (2015) reported that participants undergoing sleep deprivation made riskier decisions in gambling paradigms compared to their well-rested counterparts.
The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this effect were further explored by Lei et al. (2017), who found that sleep-deprived individuals showed reduced prefrontal cortex activity and heightened amygdala responses during high-risk decision-making tasks. These findings support the hypothesis that sleep deprivation impairs executive control while enhancing emotional reactivity, leading to impulsive risk-taking behavior.
Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Moral Decision-Making
Research on the effects of sleep deprivation on moral decision-making produced mixed results. Mazandarani & Jalilian (2023) found that individuals who experienced partial sleep deprivation displayed deficits in moral reasoning, particularly in complex ethical dilemmas requiring cognitive flexibility. Their findings aligned with those of Wang et al. (2022), who reported that participants with reduced sleep were more likely to endorse self-serving moral choices, potentially due to impaired higher-order cognitive processing.
However, some studies suggested that moral decision-making may be more resilient to sleep deprivation than risk-taking behavior. Killgore et al. (2007) examined moral judgment after 75 hours of sleep deprivation and found that although participants demonstrated slower response times, their moral judgments remained largely intact. These findings suggest that while sleep deprivation can impact the cognitive efficiency of moral decision-making, it may not necessarily lead to significant changes in moral choices themselves.
Summary of Findings
The overall synthesis of the reviewed studies suggests that sleep deprivation significantly increases risk-taking behavior, primarily due to impaired executive function and heightened emotional reactivity. The effects on moral decision-making, however, appear to be more variable, potentially due to differences in task complexity and individual susceptibility to sleep loss.
The next section will discuss these findings in relation to theoretical models, practical implications, and limitations of the existing research.
Discussion
The findings from this systematic review demonstrate a clear relationship between sleep deprivation, risk-taking behavior, and moral decision-making. The reviewed studies consistently suggest that sleep deprivation significantly increases risk-taking tendencies, primarily due to impairments in executive functioning and heightened emotional reactivity (Wei et al., 2025; Killgore, 2015). However, the effects on moral decision-making appear to be more complex, with some studies indicating minimal changes in moral judgments despite slowed cognitive processing (Killgore et al., 2007). This section interprets these findings in relation to existing psychological theories, considers methodological strengths and limitations, and highlights areas for future research.
Interpretation of Findings
The observed increase in risk-taking behavior following sleep deprivation aligns with neurocognitive theories emphasizing the role of the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in decision-making. Sleep deprivation is known to impair prefrontal cortex functioning, which is critical for impulse control, long-term planning, and risk evaluation (Lei et al., 2017). Simultaneously, it enhances activity in the amygdala, an area associated with emotional responses, leading to heightened impulsivity and reduced consideration of potential negative outcomes (Yoo et al., 2007). These neurobiological mechanisms provide a strong explanatory framework for why sleep-deprived individuals exhibit increased engagement in risk-taking behavior, particularly in high-stakes scenarios.
The findings related to moral decision-making, however, present a more nuanced picture. While Mazandarani & Jalilian (2023) found that partial sleep deprivation weakened moral reasoning, Killgore et al. (2007) observed that moral decisions themselves remained largely intact, albeit with slower response times. This discrepancy suggests that while cognitive efficiency in processing moral dilemmas is reduced, the underlying moral judgments may not be fundamentally altered. One possible explanation is that moral decision-making may rely more on deeply ingrained ethical frameworks rather than moment-to-moment cognitive control. Additionally, moral decision-making tasks often involve less immediate emotional arousal than risk-taking scenarios, potentially making them more resistant to the effects of sleep deprivation.
Strengths and Limitations of Reviewed Studies
A key strength of the reviewed studies is their methodological diversity, incorporating experimental, observational, and neuroimaging approaches to examine the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation. Studies employing fMRI and EEG analyses (e.g., Lei et al., 2017) provide robust evidence linking sleep deprivation to changes in neural activity, offering objective insights into the cognitive mechanisms underlying risk-taking behavior. Additionally, controlled experimental designs with total and partial sleep deprivation paradigms strengthen the causal interpretations of the observed effects (Killgore, 2015).
However, some methodological limitations must be acknowledged. Several studies relied on self-reported sleep deprivation, which may introduce inaccuracies in estimating actual sleep loss (Brunet et al., 2020). Sample sizes varied across studies, with some employing small, non-representative samples, limiting generalizability to broader populations (Leenaars et al., 2021). Furthermore, variations in how risk-taking and moral decision-making were operationalized make direct comparisons across studies challenging. Future research should aim to use standardized assessment tools and larger, more diverse samples to enhance the robustness of findings.
Future Research Directions
Given the observed effects of sleep deprivation on risk-taking but the mixed effects on moral decision-making, several areas warrant further exploration. Future studies should examine the long-term effects of sleep deprivation, as most reviewed research assessed short-term impacts, leaving uncertainty about whether chronic sleep deprivation leads to more profound cognitive changes. Additionally, individual differences in susceptibility to sleep loss should be investigated, as factors such as age, personality traits, and baseline cognitive abilities may moderate these effects. Another critical direction is the assessment of real-world implications, as the majority of studies were conducted in controlled laboratory settings, limiting the ability to generalize findings to professional and everyday decision-making scenarios in fields like healthcare, finance, and law enforcement. Lastly, researchers should explore potential interventions, such as caffeine, mindfulness training, or strategic napping, to determine whether these strategies can mitigate the cognitive impairments associated with sleep deprivation.

Conclusion
This systematic review highlights the significant impact of sleep deprivation on risk-taking behavior and its more nuanced effects on moral decision-making. The evidence strongly suggests that sleep deprivation increases impulsivity and risk-seeking tendencies, largely due to prefrontal cortex dysfunction and amygdala hyperactivity. While some studies indicate that moral decision-making is affected, others suggest that individuals may still adhere to their moral frameworks, albeit with slower cognitive processing.
The findings have important implications for occupational settings, public safety, and mental health, as sleep-deprived individuals may be more prone to engaging in risky behavior with potential real-world consequences. However, the variability in moral decision-making outcomes suggests that further research is needed to determine the precise cognitive mechanisms at play and whether interventions can mitigate these effects.
In conclusion, this review underscores the necessity of adequate sleep for maintaining cognitive control, ethical reasoning, and risk assessment. As modern lifestyles continue to disrupt sleep patterns, understanding the implications of sleep deprivation on decision-making remains an essential area of psychological research with broad societal relevance."
"hello, i would like you to change this review that you wrote a little bit. so basically you will get all the info after i explain what I want you to change and then i want you to change these things but keep it a scholarly 2000 word literature review. ok so: i have realized that the research question just doesnt work because there are literatally no studies that fit to it and researching the impact of sleep deprivation on criminals is very specific andwould require all the studies to be done on criminals. also i need to make sure the topic is acutally related to psychology cause rn im not sure if it is. so please change eveyrthing to make sense and align with studies. you may keep it as close to the original topic as possible but make sure that everything else still makes sense then. then next point is that in the introduction it says that the review is bridging a gap but that is not the goal, the goal is to identify and evaluate all relevant literature on a topic in order to derive conclusions about the question under consideration. also the introduction needs to make more sense. also thecurrent review is only 1000 words, i need 2000, if it is too much to od in one go we can break it down and create each section separately. everything you added so far can be explained in more detail. if you need any more info pleaseask me beforemaking the revised version. i ahve also attached the assignment document.

The Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Risk-Taking and Moral Decision-Making in Criminal Populations
Introduction
Decision-making is a complex cognitive process influenced by multiple psychological and physiological factors. One critical determinant of decision-making quality is sleep, as numerous studies indicate that sleep deprivation impairs cognitive control, increases impulsivity, and alters moral reasoning (Killgore, 2010). Given that many crimes involve impulsive actions and morally questionable choices, understanding the relationship between sleep deprivation and criminal behavior is essential. However, the precise role of sleep loss in shaping criminal decision-making remains underexplored.
Research on the cognitive consequences of sleep deprivation has demonstrated that prolonged wakefulness reduces prefrontal cortex activity, an area crucial for impulse control and moral reasoning (Venkatraman et al., 2011). Studies suggest that even moderate sleep deprivation can impair judgment similarly to alcohol intoxication (Williamson & Feyer, 2000). These cognitive impairments may be particularly relevant in forensic and criminal contexts, where individuals often face high-risk situations requiring sound decision-making.
In contrast, criminological studies have explored risk-taking and self-regulation deficits among offenders, finding that impulsivity is a key predictor of criminal behavior (Moffitt, 1993). Sleep deprivation may exacerbate these tendencies, increasing the likelihood of unethical or reckless actions. Despite the well-established link between sleep loss and impaired cognitive function, research focusing specifically on criminal populations remains scarce.
This systematic literature review aims to bridge this gap by examining how sleep deprivation influences risk-taking and moral decision-making in individuals with a history of criminal activity. By reviewing empirical studies on this topic, this paper seeks to determine whether sleep loss has a distinct impact on criminal populations or whether its effects are comparable across both offender and non-offender groups.
Method
Search Strategy
A systematic literature search was conducted across three major academic databases: ResearchGate, PubMed, and PsycInfo. These databases were selected because they provide access to high-quality peer-reviewed research in psychology and behavioral sciences, offer advanced search functions, and allow for precise filtering compared to general search engines such as Google Scholar.
The primary search terms used were:
""Sleep deprivation AND criminal activity AND risk-taking OR moral decision-making""
This search strategy was designed to capture studies examining the cognitive and behavioral consequences of sleep loss in relation to crime-relevant outcomes. Initially, broad searches returned a high number of unrelated results, including research on sleep disorders, general mental health, and workplace ethics. The search was then refined using the following criteria:
Time Frame: Studies published within the last 10–15 years to ensure contemporary relevance.
Study Type: Only empirical studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were included.
Population Focus: Studies that included offenders, probationers, or individuals at risk of committing crimes.
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion Criteria:
Studies examining sleep deprivation and its effects on risk-taking and/or moral decision-making.
Studies involving criminal populations (e.g., offenders, prisoners, probationers).
Empirical studies with quantitative or qualitative data.
Exclusion Criteria:
Studies focusing on general sleep patterns or insomnia without reference to sleep deprivation.
Theoretical papers, case studies, and non-empirical research.
Non-English publications without an available translation.
Challenges in Study Selection
A key difficulty in applying these criteria was the limited availability of studies that directly examined all three variables: sleep deprivation, crime, and decision-making. Many studies explored moral reasoning and risk-taking but did not focus on criminal populations. To address this, some high-quality studies on non-criminal samples were retained for comparison purposes. This approach allows for a better understanding of whether sleep deprivation uniquely affects offenders or if its effects are consistent across populations.
Discussion and Conclusion
Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Risk-Taking and Moral Decision-Making
The strongest studies in this review consistently found that sleep deprivation impairs moral reasoning and increases risk-taking. Killgore et al. (2007) conducted one of the most rigorous experiments on this topic, demonstrating that after 53 hours of sleep deprivation, participants exhibited significant impairments in moral decision-making, particularly when faced with ethically complex dilemmas. These results align with broader research on executive dysfunction caused by sleep deprivation (Harrison & Horne, 2000).
Similarly, Andrea et al. (2024) found that risk-taking behavior escalates during late-night hours, especially when individuals are sleep-deprived. This study suggests that criminal activity, which often occurs at night, may be partially driven by sleep-related cognitive deficits. Dickinson and Masclet (2023) further demonstrated that restricted sleep increases unethical decision-making, supporting the notion that sleep deprivation may lower moral inhibitions and impulse control.
Criminal vs. Non-Criminal Populations
One important consideration is whether criminal populations are more vulnerable to sleep deprivation than non-criminals. Research on impulsivity and self-regulation in offenders suggests that those with a history of criminal behavior already exhibit cognitive deficits in these domains (Moffitt, 1993). Therefore, sleep deprivation may have a greater impact on their decision-making abilities compared to the general population.
However, some studies indicate that sleep deprivation affects decision-making similarly across all individuals, regardless of criminal background. Hamilton and Alloy (2022) found that college students with poor sleep patterns exhibited increased sensation-seeking behavior, suggesting that the effects of sleep deprivation on risk-taking may not be unique to criminals. This raises questions about whether sleep deprivation is a causal factor in criminal decision-making or if it merely exacerbates preexisting tendencies.
Limitations of Existing Research
Several limitations in the current literature must be acknowledged:
Diverse Study Populations: Some studies focus on delinquents, some on prisoners, and others on general populations. This makes direct comparisons difficult.
Methodological Variability: Some studies rely on self-reported sleep duration, while others use controlled experimental deprivation protocols.
Lack of Longitudinal Studies: Most research examines short-term sleep deprivation, leaving long-term effects on criminal behavior largely unknown.
Future Research Directions
To better understand the role of sleep deprivation in criminal behavior, future studies should:
Focus on incarcerated populations to determine whether sleep loss influences recidivism.
Use objective sleep tracking methods (e.g., actigraphy, polysomnography) instead of self-reports.
Investigate potential interventions, such as sleep therapy programs in correctional settings, to examine whether improving sleep quality reduces criminal tendencies.
Conclusion
This systematic review highlights the negative impact of sleep deprivation on moral decision-making and risk-taking, suggesting that impaired cognitive function due to sleep loss may contribute to criminal behavior. While research supports this connection, there remains uncertainty regarding whether offenders are uniquely vulnerable or if these effects are consistent across all populations. Further research is needed to clarify the causal mechanisms involved and explore intervention strategies aimed at mitigating the risks associated with sleep deprivation.

"following the argument of the essay belo, can you help to address the consequences and risks of instability on liberal democracies? Francis Fukuyama writes, in the Preface to The End of History and the Last Man (1992: xxii-xxiii):
‘Following Nietzsche’s line of thought, we are compelled to ask the following questions: Is not the man who is completely satisfied by nothing more than universal and equal recognition less than a full human being, indeed, an object of contempt, a “last man” with neither striving nor aspiration? Is there not a side of the human personality that deliberately seeks out struggle, danger, risk, and daring, and will this side not remain unfulfilled by the “peace and prosperity” of contemporary liberal democracy? Does not the satisfaction of certain human beings depend on recognition that is inherently unequal? Indeed, does not the desire for unequal recognition constitute the basis of a liveable life, not just for bygone aristocratic societies, but also in modern liberal democracies? Will not their future survival depend, to some extent, on the degree to which their citizens seek to be recognized not just as equal, but as superior to others? And might not the fear of becoming contemptible “last men”; not lead men to assert themselves in new and unforeseen ways, even to the point of becoming once again bestial “first men” engaged in bloody prestige battles, this time with modern weapons?’

What are the implications of these thoughts for the idea of democracy and its central notion of equality?
Fukuyama's ""The End of History and the Last Man"" explores the concept of the ""last man,"" a figure content with the ""peace and prosperity"" of contemporary liberal democracy, but lacking striving and aspiration (Fukuyama, 1992). According to Fukuyama (1992), the question is whether the ""completely satisfied"" man is really the end goal of human development, or if this ""last man"" is detestable. Fukuyama, drawing on Hegel, argues that human beings inherently desire recognition (thymos), which can manifest in two forms; isothymia, which means the desire to be recognized as equal to others, or megalothymia, the desire to be recognized as superior. Furthermore, he suggests that liberal democracies, while satisfying the desire for equal recognition, may struggle to provide outlets for the desire for distinction or superiority, inherent in humanity. This can lead to a sense of incompleteness or dissatisfaction, potentially undermining the stability of liberal democratic societies. Equality is a core democratic value, challenged by the persistent human desire for superiority. Suppose this equality alone is insufficient to sustain democracy, as the human desire for superiority risks its stability. In that case, the issue may not lie solely in judicial equality, equal opportunity and de facto equality, but also in social and economic structures, such as unequal wealth or prosperity opportunities, that fuel competitive hierarchies. This essay will argue that democratic inequality does not rise from judicial, opportunity or de facto shortcomings, but from the broader socio-economic forces that cultivate and reinforce the desire for dominance. First, the essay will address what democratic equality is and what Fukuyama defends about it, introducing the debate between ambition and equality. Secondly, it will address how socioeconomic inequalities impact the concept of equality in democracies. Finally, it will evaluate the risks of social inequality for democracies. 
Democracy is founded as the principle of universal recognition and equality, asserting that all individuals are inherently equal in dignity and rights (O’Mahoney, 2012). Within democratic systems, every person has equal opportunity to participate in governance, free from discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or other characteristics. This foundational principle dismantles rigid class structures, allowing individuals greater freedom to shape their destinies while fostering self-reliance and personal independence (Tocqueville, 1840). However, Fukuyama reveals a fundamental tension within liberal democracy; while it promotes universal recognition, it conflicts with the persistent human drive for distinction and superiority. This creates a paradox where democratic equality faces challenges from both the risk of stagnation - the ""Last Man""-  and violent regression-  the ""First Man"". Democratic individualism presents both strengths and vulnerabilities. Tocqueville (1840) observed that while democracy elevates individuals by removing hierarchies, it may simultaneously suppress human ambitions. By prioritizing individual concerns over collective engagement, democratic societies risk fragmentation as citizens retreat into private life rather than actively participating in public affairs. Furthermore, government enforcement of consensus through majority opinion, what Tocqueville called the ""tyranny of the majority”. This can discourage individuals from challenging dominant ideas, thereby limiting societal progress. While some look up for universal dignity, others try to bring down the powerful, trying to achieve equality. Nevertheless, liberal democracy replaces traditional social hierarchies with a system of universal and reciprocal recognition (Fukuyama, 1992). Unlike aristocratic societies that granted status based on birthright, liberal democracy ensures recognition through protected rights, including property ownership, freedom of expression, religious practice, and political participation. This universal recognition, however, creates tension. While democracy promises equality, human nature craves distinction. Fukuyama, drawing on Hegel and Nietzsche, argues that individuals not only seek recognition as equals but also desire acknowledgment of their superiority or achievements. Liberal democracies, while successful in providing legal and political equality, may struggle to satisfy this deeper human need for distinction, potentially leading to dissatisfaction with democracy itself (Fukuyama, 1992). Excessive individualism may undermine democratic institutions by eroding civic responsibility. When individuals disengage from politics, the state may gradually assume more control,  potentially leading to authoritarian governance where citizens exchange civic rights for protection and convenience. This resembles Hobbes's Leviathan (1651), where individuals, as ""first men"", exchange rights for protection from anarchic power. The ""last man,"" unsatisfied with mere equality, risks becoming the ""first man"" again. As Nietzsche argued in The Will to Power (1901), the desire for power represents a fundamental driving force in human nature. This irrational desire for superiority threatens democratic stability, potentially eroding democracy through authoritarian tendencies or forcing it to adapt to new forms of recognition.
As Robert Dahl (2007) argues, equality is a fundamental premise of democracy. The democratic equality rests on the principle that all citizens should have an equal say in decision-making, regardless of their social or economic background. Democracy includes all voices, and no group holds disproportionate power over others. However, while political equality is a central democratic value, it does not automatically lead to an overall equality in society. Fukuyama (1992) distinguished between three forms of equality, being: judicial equality, equality of opportunity, and de facto social equality. While judicial equality and equal opportunity are often connected with democratic constitutions, de facto social equality remains disparate, particularly in societies characterized by extreme wealth disparities and class divisions. In other words, political equality, while guaranteeing formal rights, does not address the structural inequalities that shape real-world access to power and resources. Amartya Sen (1999) argues that freedom depends on material preconditions. A society that formally grants equal rights but fails to provide the necessary economic and social conditions for individuals to exercise those rights is not truly free nor equal. Liberal society must provide the necessary preconditions for individual freedom. This often requires redistribution mechanisms, equitable access to basic services and state intervention to correct market failures that have a major impact on disadvantaged people. Without those measures, wealth disparities translate into power inequality, leading to a system where economic elites wield disproportionate influence over political institutions. This undermines the democratic ideal of equal representation. Despite democracy’s theoretical commitment to equality, the human desire for status, competition, and superiority is fueled by capitalism, an economic systems that reward those who succeed in accumulating wealth, thereby reinforcing materialistic inequality as a threat to democracy. This economic model prioritizes efficiency over quality, leading to an increase in wealth distribution. Wealth accumulation is self-reinforcing, those who possess capital have greater access to education, investment opportunities, and political influence, perpetuating economic hierarchies. This fosters a new form of aristocracy, where economic elites dominate media ownership, public discourse, and policy decisions, leading to an oligarchic space within democracies. Fukuyama (1992) argues that liberal democracy promises universal recognition but does not satisfy the deeper human desire for superiority and hierarchy. If political systems fail to provide meaningful avenues for status, individuals will seek alternative ways to assert their dominance, through economic, social or political power. The growing wealth gap in Western democracies has fueled populist backlashes, as economically disenfranchised citizens increasingly view the system as rigged in favor of elites. The problem increases when wealth determines access to media representation, policymaking, or political candidacy, and consequently formal political equality becomes meaningless. Democracies risk evolving into antidemocratic systems, where elections are heavily influenced by corporate and elite interests rather than the will of the general population, as it can now be seen in the US. Fukuyama warns that if democracy fails to balance equality and hierarchical recognition, societies may drift toward authoritarian or elitist governance structures that explicitly embrace economic and political hierarchies. The revival of nationalist and authoritarian movements can be seen as a reaction to economic disenfranchisement, as voters reject democracy’s failure to address inequalities."

ARGUMENT
Fukuyama: religious observance promotes non-liberal values, people are individualistic in nature, want personal well-being → once they stop using the excuse of god they’ll choose democracy

Huntington is not a pcifier, he’s polemic and arguing for wartime (Said) → his theory only promjotes war so it’s not a valuable framework to read conflicts + ignores the complexities of geopolitics 
Tanzania as an example that religious pluralism can exist within a country and sustainable democracy → the reason why conflict would appear is because western country have this idea that their “value set” is always and inherently superior and that they have the duty to export it. As  Formann () puts it: liberalism is the re­fusal to engage in principled ideological struggle inside and out­side of a revolutionary organization. The main source of conflict will be found in liberalism itself.

Does policy-making in coalition governments a!ect cabinet parties’ electoral performance? Previous research shows that about two thirds of all propositions promised in coalition agreements are actually enacted. But does non-compliance with pledges made in the agreement a!ect subsequent electoral support? Drawing on the literature on performance voting, we expect that non-compliance is punished by voters, but the e!ect is conditioned by the importance of the issue and by a parties’ seniority status within the coalition. To test our argument, we have compiled the new comparative COALITIONPOLICY dataset on the enactment of more than 7000 policy pledges by 217 cabinet parties in 19 Western and Eastern European countries from 2000 to 2015. Across a broad range of models, we ""nd no e!ect of pledge ful""llment on subsequent electoral performance. If anything, adherence to policy-promises only increases support for the prime minister party. These results have important implications for our understanding of political representation, coalition governance, and electoral competition in multiparty democracies.
Introduction
Does policy-making in coalition governments a!ect cabinet parties’ subsequent electoral performance? Before coalition governments take over executive o#ces, they typically engage in intensive coalition negotiations and publish a comprehensive coalition agreement in which they provide a detailed account of the policy reforms they plan to enact in government. The adoption of coalition agreements is typically a highly visible event that is accompanied by extensive media coverage so that voters receive a lot of information about the major promises that multiparty governments make in their coalition agreements. However, previous research shows that only about two thirds of all the policy reforms promised in coalition agreements were actually enacted (Moury, 2011, 2013). How does non-compliance with the promises made in coalition agreements a!ect subsequent electoral support? In this study, we address this question by leveraging a novel comparative dataset that maps the ful""llment of policy pledges made in coalition agreements across 19 European democracies.
Previous research devoted most attention to election pledges made in pre-election party programs. Researchers have examined when and why political parties do (not) ful""ll the promises they have made in their manifestos (Artés, 2013; Costello and Thomson, 2008; Naurin, 2011, 2014; Praprotnik, 2016; Royed, 1996; Schermann and Ennser-Jedenastik, 2014; Thomson, 2001; Thomson et al., 2017). Our work also builds on the vast literature on retrospective economic and performance voting (Ferejohn, 1986; Fiorina, 1981; Key and Cummings, 1966). Importantly, Matthieß (2020) posits voters rewarding of party accomplishments and their attribution of competence based on perceptions of pledge performance as two mechanisms linking pledge ful""llment to voting behavior. These mechanisms should be at play when evaluating coalition parties based on their agreement commitments. However, both mechanisms rely on the fact that voters behave rationally, policy-seeking (Downs, 1957), and can clearly allocate pledges to governing parties (Powell and Whitten, 1993). If these assumptions are violated, rational retrospective evaluations by constituents can be impeded. Matthieß (2020) shows that the ful""llment of election pledges has important electoral implications. She ""nds that higher ful""llment leads to better performance at elections. Thus, voters reward parties for complying with their promises while sanctioning parties that do not ful""ll their election pledges. Prior coalition research has by contrast studied coalition agreements in terms of bargaining success (Däubler and Debus, 2009; Quinn et al., 2011), as a control mechanism (e.g., Bowler et al., 2016; Eichorst, 2014; Indridason and Kristinsson, 2013; Klüver et al., 2023; Klüver and Bäck, 2019; Krauss, 2018; Müller and Kaare, 2000; Müller and Strøm, 2008; Timmermans, 2006), and with regard to their impact on policy-making during the legislative term (e.g., Bäck et al., 2017; Moury, 2011). However, the electoral impact of coalition agreement enactment remains unclear.
Even though the negotiation of a coalition contract is one of the most important political events during government formation, we know surprisingly little about the electoral consequences of not adhering to its policy propositions. While coalition negotiations are con""dential, the presentation of the coalition agreement is highly visible. Coalition parties typically organize big press conferences to announce what has been negotiated in the past weeks. Media outlets report about the bargain struck between coalition partners and monitor the ful""llment of policy pledges throughout the legislative term.
In this article, we address this important question and shed new light on the electoral consequences of non- compliance with policy pledges for individual cabinet parties. We do so based on the new COALITIONPOLICY dataset which maps policy pledges made by 217 parties in 86 coalition agreements across 19 Western and Eastern European countries. Their performance is evaluated based on the ful""llment of more than 7000 individual pledges made between 2000 and 2015. We match this rich dataset with election results to investigate the consequences of (not) enacting the coalition agreement for electoral support. Counter- intuitively, we ""nd that the enactment of coalition agreements does not increase subsequent vote share across a large number of di!erent model speci""cations. Voters do not seem to reward or punish coalition parties for (non-)compliance with the coalition contract. These results are relevant for our understanding of political representation and coalition governance in multiparty democracies.
Research design Dataset
We test our argument based on the newly compiled COALITIONPOLICY Dataset which maps policy pledges made in coalition agreements based on a hand-coded content analysis by country experts. The dataset covers 86 coalition agreements negotiated in 19 European countries between 2000 and 2015. We elaborate on the document selection and country sample in Appendix Section A. Our selection of countries follows established standards in coalition research and only includes European democracies that were governed by coalition cabinets which have publicly released a coalition agreement at least once in the time period under investigation (see Andersson et al., 2014). As discussed in Appendix Section A, we draw on o#cial government programs that ful""ll certain criteria whenever agreements only cover technical content (see Klüver and Bäck, 2019). We also provide more graphical evidence on the distribution of pledge performance across our sample in Appendix Section C.
Capturing electoral performance using lagged dependent variables
In the main manuscript, we assess the electoral performance of cabinet parties using a lagged dependent variable (LDV) approach. For each governing party, the vote share (scaled 0–100) at the election that follows the cabinet formation constitutes our outcome of interest. Crucially, we control for the vote share of each party during the election that preceded coalition formation. Intuitively, we therefore capture the e!ect of policy performance during the governing term on the vote share at the following election while controlling for the vote share at the previous election.
Election results are obtained from the ParlGov database (Döring and Manow, 2018). To test the robustness of our ""ndings, we rerun the main analysis using (a) the vote ratio, and (b) the absolute di!erence between two subsequent election results as dependent variables (see Appendix Sections G and F). The results do not change substantially across these outcomes.
Explanatory variables: Policy performance
We measure the policy performance of individual cabinet parties by tracking how many of the policy pledges made in the coalition agreement are actually ful""lled during their time in o#ce. To do so, we rely on a novel, extensive content analysis of coalition agreements. For each cabinet party, we identify speci""c policy pledges to which it has committed itself during the coalition negotiations. A policy pledge is de""ned as a promise to carry out an action or to produce a policy outcome whose ful""llment can be objectively veri""ed (see Royed, 1996). To ensure reliability, we follow previous research and distinguish between objectively veri""able hard pledges and more vague statements that contain soft or no pledges (Matthieß, 2020; Thomson et al., 2017). We discuss our coding process and reliability checks in more detail in Appendix Section D.
In order to measure each parties’ share of ful""lled hard pledges, we rely on two additional steps conducted by the country experts. First, they coded the enactment of the policy pledges as either fully ful""lled or not fully ful""lled. The evaluation is based on national legislative databases, o#cial statistics (for instance, from national statistical o#ces, Eurostat, or government reports and websites), and articles of trustworthy newspapers.
Second, the experts coded if a pledge found in the coalition agreement can be attributed to a speci""c cabinet party. They checked if a hard pledge was already mentioned in their election manifestos (obtained from the Manifesto Project (Lehmann et al., 2021)). The coders examined the campaign manifestos for mentions of every hard pledge identi""ed in the agreement. This allows us to dissect which party actually pushed for a pledge to be part of the mutual agreement. According to a responsible party model, we expect that a cabinet party which is more successful in codifying their propositions in the coalition agreement and then translating them into policy should be rewarded by its supporters. Out of 13,756 unique hard pledges identi""ed in the agreements, our coders were able to attribute 7’299 pledges (or 55%) to at least one cabinet party. These 7’299 agreement pledges constitute the basis of all subsequent analyses.
We then calculate two party-speci""c independent variables: First, party pledge count is a simple count of the number of policy pledges in an agreement that have been mentioned by a respective party and ful""lled throughout the legislative term of the coalition government. Second, we take the count and divide it by the total number of hard pledges in the coalition agreement to calculate the party pledge share. This variable takes the overall number of pledges made in the agreement into account.
Measuring issue salience for parties
In addition, we also pay attention to the divergent salience of di!erent policy areas across parties. It is likely that voters particularly reward or punish coalition parties for (not) ful""lling pledges made in policy areas relevant for the party (see e.g., Plescia et al., 2021). To do so, we are breaking our data down to the party- issue level for some analyses. We do so based on the assignment of a policy ""eld for every hard pledge in our sample. Our coders assigned a policy code based on the Manifesto Project (Lehmann et al., 2021) to all policy pledges which we identi""ed in the coalition agreements. Following Klüver and Spoon (2016), we identi""ed 11 pivotal issue areas for which the Project’s codebook includes positional categories. Appendix Section H provides an overview of the issue areas and associated categories.
Based on matching the coalition agreement data with the manifesto data, we generate three di!erent salience variables: Manifesto salience speci""es how salient the general issue was to the speci""c cabinet party prior to the election. We do so by calculating the share of text a party dedicated to an issue area in its entire party manifesto. In essence, this measure assesses how relevant the general issue has been to a speci""c cabinet party before the election. Pledge salience speci""es how salient a speci""c pledge was to the cabinet party prior to the election. We do so by calculating the average amount of words that each cabinet party has devoted to pledges of a speci""c issue area. For instance, a party manifesto could refer over pages about economic policy, but only brie$y mention speci""c economic hard pledges codi""ed in the coalition agreement. This measure assesses how relevant the actual pledges made in an issue area have been to a cabinet party prior to the election. Agreement salience speci""es how salient an issue area was in the mutual coalition agreement drafted after the election. It is based on the share of text in the agreement that was dedicated to an issue area relative to its overall length. Note that this measure also considers parts of the agreement that deal with a policy ""eld even when it does not contain hard pledges. Thus, this measure assesses how relevant an issue area has been for the entire cabinet after the election.
By generating measures of salience and pledge ful""llment across the speci""c policy ""elds, our data is able to capture multidimensional complexity that goes along with coalition bargaining and promise keeping. Quite often, parties can hold very similar positions in one policy ""eld—that is, European Integration—while being far apart on other issues such as economic redistribution. More detailed descriptive statistics on our dependent and explanatory variables can be found in Section A of the Appendix.
Additional control variables
Beyond having the prior vote share as a crucial control in the LDV-models, we also account for a number of potential confounders. First, we control for party status in the coalition as previous research has shown that junior parties generally lose votes at the next election (Klüver and Spoon, 2020). We thus incorporate the simple dichotomous PM party variable that receives the value of “1” whenever the prime minister was appointed by a party and “0” if a coalition party is a junior partner in the government. We also interact this measure with our salience variables. Second, since previous research on economic voting has shown that macroeconomic performance is an important predictor of incumbents’ electoral performance (Lewis-Beck et al., 2000), we also control for economic growth. Economic Growth is based on IMF data on yearly real GDP growth, operationalized in GDP percentage change between the beginning and at the end of a government’s term in o#ce.
In addition, we control for cabinet-level attributes that can impact the clarity of responsibility. We account for the ideological distance of the cabinet, measured as the log value of the di!erence between the left- and rightmost party. The value is based on the distance between the two most extreme election manifestos on the rile-measure (Lehmann et al., 2021). Next, we also include the absolute number of cabinet parties and a minority cabinet dummy. Finally, models without ""xed e!ects also include a dummy variable that denotes if a country is located in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) to account for di!erences across established Western and younger East European democracies.
Data analysis
In what follows, we test the e!ect agreement pledge ful""llment across a large range of model speci""cations. First, we estimate party-level models without taking di!erent issue areas into account. Since pledges in some policy areas might be more relevant for the electoral performance of parties than pledges made in other areas, we then estimate issue-level models. All standard errors are clustered at the country level.
Party-level models
Figure 1 presents results from 16 regression models using the LDV approach. Full tables can be found in Appendix Section E, where models 1–4 in Table 7 contain country ""xed e!ects and models 5–8 in Table 7 omit the ""xed e!ects. For each variable, we plot the estimate with country ""xed e!ects (upper point) and without country ""xed e!ects (lower point). The bars represent the 95% con""dence intervals. The upper part of the ""gure shows null e!ects for our two independent variables derived from regular regression models. The lower half of Figure 1 shows the interaction between our independent variables and the prime minister party dummy. Figure 1 illustrates that neither party pledge share, party pledge count nor the interaction e!ects lead us to believe that compliance with policy pledges in coalition agreements has a substantive e!ect on subsequent electoral performance. The e!ects we ""nd are substantially small and mostly do not reach conventional levels of statistical signi""cance. If at all, we ""nd a tendency suggesting that prime minister parties can pro""t from pledge enactment.
Figure 1. Coe#cient plot for the party-level models using the LDV approach (95% CI).
Issue-level models
For the issue-level models, we again estimate linear regression models with and without country ""xed e!ects. The corresponding tables can be found in Appendix Section E. The upper plot suggests that pledge performance within speci""c issue categories does not in$uence the vote ratio.
More interesting than the overall null e!ects (which mimic the results from the party-level analysis) are the interactions with regard to salience. We interact the independent variables on pledge ful""llment with our three measures for policy salience to test whether the ful""llment of pledges in speci""c policy areas has an e!ect on the electoral performance. Just as for the party-level models, we estimated every model with and without country ""xed e!ects. The lower part of Figure 2 shows that we do not ""nd any meaningful interaction e!ects. None of the coe#cients show con""dently that pledge performance matters for electoral performance, irrespective of how salient a pledge may have been to a party or coalition. Only the interaction between the absolute pledge count and pledge salience results in a marginal, yet signi""cant positive e!ect.
Figure 2. Coe#cient plot for the issue-level models using the LDV approach (95% CI).
Appendix Sections G and F show similar null-result patterns for models with vote di!erential or vote ratio as alternative outcomes. In nearly all models, pledge ful""llment does not have a systematic e!ect on coalition parties’ electoral performance. We also assess if our null-""ndings are driven by the diverse country sample that also covers younger democracies in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). In Appendix Section I, we show that the results of our main analysis are robust even when we exclude cases from CEE.
Conclusion
In this article, we have addressed the question whether the (non-)ful""llment of policy pledges made in coalition agreements has electoral implications for coalition parties. Based on the newly compiled COALITIONPOLICY Dataset mapping the ful""llment of policy pledges by more than 200 cabinet parties across 19 West and East European democracies, we conclude that the enactment of coalition agreements does not garner electoral payo!s. Citizens appear to cast their vote irrespective of a cabinet parties’ adherence to its policy propositions.
These ""ndings have important implications for our understanding of coalition governance, electoral accountability, and political representation. First, with regard to coalition governance, our results suggest that coalition parties can make policies without having to fear electoral repercussions if they do not stick to the agreement. In terms of vote-maximization, coalition agreements do not seem to dictate the policy agenda throughout the legislative term. Voters do not punish coalition parties for non-compliance. The parties have some $exibility to deviate from the negotiated agreement without jeopardizing their reelection. Hence, governments can respond to current developments such as economic downturns, international crises, or natural disasters without having to stick to the pledges they have made before taking o#ce.
Second, while we ""nd that the enactment of coalition agreements cannot explain the electoral performance of coalition parties, Matthieß (2020) showed that the ful""llment of campaign pledges made in election manifestos does positively e!ect on electoral performance. Even when we restrict our country sample to Western democracies, mimicking the sample of Matthieß (2020), we do not ""nd a similar e!ect with regard to coalition agreements (see Appendix Section I). Based on the implications by Matthieß (2020) with regard to the signi""cant e!ect of party manifestos and the null-""ndings brought forth in our analysis, we conclude that voters do hold government parties accountable for their performance in o#ce, but that voters use the election manifesto rather than coalition agreements as a yardstick. Thus, voters reward political parties for implementing their election pledges, but they do not seem to evaluate the enactment of the coalition agreement. Future research could build on this ""nding and the work by Matthieß (2020) to trace the entire chain of accountability from election manifestos to coalition agreements to actual policy-making.
Overall, coalition agreements are important documents, but appear to matter more for con$ict management within the cabinet than for electoral competition. Voters do not reward or sanction compliance with the agreement, so coalition parties are insulated from electoral scrutiny when implementing policy. Prior research shows that coalition agreements are e!ective control instruments for managing preference divergence across parties. While they give coalition parties an instrument to constrain their partners, coalition contracts play little role in electoral competition."

"Francis Fukuyama writes, in the Preface to The End of History and the Last Man (1992: xxii-xxiii):
‘Following Nietzsche’s line of thought, we are compelled to ask the following questions: Is not the man who is completely satisfied by nothing more than universal and equal recognition less than a full human being, indeed, an object of contempt, a “last man” with neither striving nor aspiration? Is there not a side of the human personality that deliberately seeks out struggle, danger, risk, and daring, and will this side not remain unfulfilled by the “peace and prosperity” of contemporary liberal democracy? Does not the satisfaction of certain human beings depend on recognition that is inherently unequal? Indeed, does not the desire for unequal recognition constitute the basis of a liveable life, not just for bygone aristocratic societies, but also in modern liberal democracies? Will not their future survival depend, to some extent, on the degree to which their citizens seek to be recognized not just as equal, but as superior to others? And might not the fear of becoming contemptible “last men”; not lead men to assert themselves in new and unforeseen ways, even to the point of becoming once again bestial “first men” engaged in bloody prestige battles, this time with modern weapons?’

What are the implications of these thoughts for the idea of democracy and its central notion of
equality?"

As the liberation war goes on, the people will suffer many wounds. This chapter, Fanon says, explores the mental disorders suffered during the Algerian War. The reader may find it strange that this book involves psychiatry case files. “There is absolutely nothing we can do about that,” Fanon says. Colonialism is “a great purveyor of psychiatric hospitals.” As it sought to completely negate the humanity of another, colonialism has caused many colonized individuals to question who they are. 
Fanon’s comment that there is nothing to be done about the fact that his book contains case files reflects their importance. For Fanon, the psychological effects of colonization are the most significant and lasting effects of colonialism. There is no shortage of mental disorders in the colonial situation, Fanon implies, as colonialism is a “great purveyor” of hospitals.

When colonialism exists without armed rebellion, and the violence and oppression hit a specific limit, “the colonized’s defenses collapse.” As a result, many are admitted to psychiatric institutions. Algeria, where a liberation war has been raging for seven years, is “a breeding ground for mental disorders.” This chapter includes both Algerian and French patients, and most of them are suffering from a “psychotic reaction,” which means a specific situation triggered the psychotic event. In this case, the trigger is the Algerian War.
Here, Fanon implies that colonialism places so much mental stress on the colonized, they reach a point when they just snap. Algeria’s war has been raging for years, which means the people have had plenty of time to snap (hence it is a “breeding ground for mental disorders). Fanon’s use of the medical term “psychotic reaction” effectively places the blame for such disorders on colonialism, where, in Fanon’s opinion, it rightfully belongs.

QUOTES
It is of note, Fanon says, that most of the cases of psychotic reaction in this chapter are “relatively benign.” Cases in which one’s entire personality is dislocated are rare. However, Fanon still contends that each of these cases as “pathological processes” are “malignant.” These mental disorders are chronic, they attack the mind and ego, and leave the patient vulnerable. While these disorders are “benign,” the patients’ futures are completely “compromised,” Fanon says.
Here, Fanon explains that even though the medical field considers such psychological problems relatively harmless, Fanon argues that they are not so “benign.” The people suffering from them are horribly afflicted, and there is no reason to believe that such illnesses will ever completely resolve. Thus, the patients’ lives will always be “compromised.”

"as a foreign policy analysis expert, critically explain and analyse the main thesis  in a discursive way following the author's main train of thought, in detail : This chapter explores the dynamic and strategic processes transitional states undergo to achieve international recognition and legitimacy. Essential to their success is the support of a ‘sponsor’, typically a state
or coalition within influential multilateral institutions like the United Nations (UN). These sponsors advocate for the transitional governments, portraying them as adherents to cosmopolitan ideals and thus legitimate aspirants to sovereignty. Historical examples, such as the formation of the UN’s Special Committee on Apartheid and the exclusion of authoritarian regimes from UN representation, illustrate how international support can shape the fate of transitional governments. This pathway to recognition often requires shifting ideological allegiances, as seen in the post-Cold War era’s widespread rejection of Marxism–Leninism in favour of neoliberalism, reflecting the opportunistic aspects of these movements’ engagements
with global powers. Through formal and informal interactions within international forums, these entities undergo a process of socialisation, subtly guided by their sponsors, that prepares them to play their roles on the world stage effectively.
11.2 Transitional foreign policy and international recognition
For governments in transitional states, achieving international recognition is essential for their long-term quest for power. Crucial to winning recognition is a ‘sponsor’ (inevitably a state or coalition of states) within multilateral institutions, and an ability to cast the aspirant governing authorities as conforming to cosmopolitan ideals. International institutions are gatekeepers of sovereign recognition and use established rules and procedures to grant or withhold legitimacy. In the context of the UN, the Security Council ultimately has the final word on recognition, though
the procedures reflect the outlook of the General Assembly as well. Examples of this process at work include the willingness of a coalition
of states to use resources to create the UN’s Special Committee on Apartheid and the UN Institute for Namibia, the willingness to grant observer status to a variety of liberation movements and, concurrently,
to disallow authoritarian governments representative status in either the UN or its agencies. Individual states also use their own resources, be they diplomatic (by making formal representation of non-state actor interests
  in multilateral settings) or material (by providing the financial and physical support necessary to allow cash-strapped movements and new governments the means of carrying on their search for recognition and legitimacy).
Aspirant political entities such as liberation and opposition movements have a strong element of opportunism in their engagement with sponsor states; this was readily seen in the post-Cold War summary abandonment of Marxist–Leninism for neo-liberalism by many apparently committed adherents. Despite this, there is clearly a process of socialisation that occurs in the context of extended informal engagement and achieving formal recognition within international organisations.
International institutions and non-governmental organisations (as well as other non-state actors such as political foundations) play a critical role in this training and broader socialisation process.
11.3 Transitional foreign policy and domestic structure
The focus of scholastic enquiries into the foreign policy of transitional states has been on the relationship between regime type and foreign
policy choice. Samuel Huntington (1993) proposes a typology of regimes, specifically, transformation (incumbent caretaker) led from above; replacement (revolutionary provisional) where the ancien regime is ousted altogether and a revolutionary government takes its place, albeit with
an explicit mandate to usher in democratic change; and transplacement (a power-sharing interim government). He suggests that each of these transitional governments are faced with a dilemma regarding the previous authoritarian government’s foreign policy which centres around how and when to demonstrate change, continuity and to retain or build legitimacy. The critical factor is the constituency that the transitional government is beholden to in defining and addressing foreign policy preferences.
Building upon this work, Allison Stanger (1995) puts the focus more explicitly on regime type as the key determinant in understanding foreign policy choice by transitional governments. She says that the character of each of Huntington’s three regime types provides the underlying motivation for their foreign policy. Paulo Gorjão (2002) looks to domestic structure and, in particular, the role of corporate entities (or institutional representations of collective interests) like the military or the Catholic Church, as well as
the role of charismatic individuals to shape selection and promote their respective interests on given foreign policy issues. He believes that in turbulent times of transition these entities are better able to articulate
and influence decision-makers who might otherwise lack the requisite information, or the sense of certainty needed to make difficult decisions.
Examining transitional states and foreign policy through the rubric of domestic structures tells us which foreign policy issue a certain regime type will take up as a function of constituencies, both international and domestic.
11.4 Transitional foreign policy and charismatic leadership
The character of the political leadership of a transitional state is crucial in mobilising support for it, both internationally and domestically, as well as in shaping perceptions of the transition. This individual in many respects symbolises the anti-authoritarian struggle for the international and domestic constituency, and has an opportunity – and sometimes
a commensurate ability – to articulate the foreign policy aims of the
Chapter 11: The foreign policy of states in transition
  79 transitional state. For example, Maria Corazon Aquino, wife of the assassinated Filipino opposition leader with no political experience of
her own, was seen by virtue of familial association to be the symbol of oppositional politics in the Philippines and the key figure around which the domestic and international forces coalesced during the transition. Leaders, again by virtue of their standing and the recognition accorded
to them as individuals who embody cosmopolitan values, can shape
and promote aims that reflect their interpretation of national priorities.
Of equal importance is the capacity of leaders as domestic coalition builders and interlocutors between local politics and the international community. Charismatic leaders who are able to negotiate across these two settings, against a backdrop of the uncertainty and change that comes with transitions, are more likely to be able to succeed in achieving their government’s foreign policy goals.
Examining transitional states and foreign policy through the rubric of individual leadership provides us with a means of understanding the selection and promotion of specific foreign policy issues by transitional governments. Furthermore, it is suggestive of the importance of perception in moulding international institutional responsiveness to transitional states’ agendas. The role of contingency and human agency is more readily apparent than seen in the previous two dimensions outlined in sections 11.2 and 11.3.
11.5 Overview of chapter
This chapter looked at the impact of change on states themselves, a
topic traditionally neglected in foreign policy analysis (FPA) and which demonstrates that under these circumstances foreign policy is beholden to a number of factors. The constant among all such states is the search for international legitimacy, while the contingent nature of transitional regime type and the character of leadership introduce variables to the process of foreign policy formulation for transitional states. Examining this phenomenon reasserts the role and specificity of agency in the actions of states as well as the significance of domestic and systemic structures to influencing choice. This therefore contributes to our broader understanding of foreign policy."

In this chapter, we look at democratic political systems in the context
of state institutions rather than party politics. Although there are a
few exceptions, most democratic governments have a clear leader of government. The head of government is sometimes the head of state, but there are cases where this is not so. In some countries the head of state is essentially an honorary figure that represents a country rather than ruling it. The honorary head of state can be a hereditary monarch (as in Britain), a directly elected figure (as in southern Ireland), or an indirectly elected figure (as in Germany).
Every head of government has to operate on several different levels. They are ultimately responsible for the ordinary work of government. Much of the work of any state is routine and relatively humdrum, but efficiency
is important in any society and the failure of state institutions to work efficiently can impinge seriously upon the lives of ordinary people. Nobody wants to be wrongly imprisoned, wrongly bankrupted or otherwise mistreated by government agencies. Moreover, where the press is free and independent, scandalous issues of this kind tend to be heavily publicised when they arise, and this kind of publicity can do great harm to the image of any government.
In the developing world, a lot of the blame for relatively poor economic performance is generally placed on low quality public administration.
Chapter 6: Bureaucracy and the democratic state
     69 The result can be corruption or simple inefficiency. In the 1990s, a lot of weight was given by donors on the idea of ‘good government’ and the idea of administrative reform was very much in vogue. Although some progress was made in some cases, the general outcome of good government agendas was on the whole disappointing. The main reason for this was the highly political nature of effective reform. Without a real political will to make changes, the result was a continuation of traditional modes of governance. Bureaucratic organisation within democratic states: a brief history
It is necessary for all governments to have a bureaucracy at their disposal. This is partly because all states simply have to do certain things in order to guarantee their own survival. In the first chapter we saw that the modern state normally enjoys a monopoly of organised force. However, in order to maintain the most elementary internal police force and external defences, some form of taxation is necessary. It is therefore necessary for even the most minimalist state to decide who pays tax and how much they should pay,
and then make sure that they do pay. There needs to be a judicial system to enforce compliance. All of this requires administration.
Clearly most contemporary states are far from minimalist. The development of democratic forms of government in Europe was associated with an extension of the role of the state. In most developed countries democracy was accompanied by demands for the provision of improved public services and for some redistribution of income. The result was a much more extensive set of governmental responsibilities. This was clearly the will of the people, and it was then necessary to find a means of ensuring that this will was enforced.
Over the last century the belief also took root, in developed and developing countries alike, that the state should take at least some responsibility for enhancing national prosperity. Some countries experimented with outright Socialism, but this has been somewhat discredited due to the failures of the Soviet Union. However, even capitalist countries look upon government to
set interest rates, regulate the banking system, either build or organise the construction of infrastructure, organise and run a system of public education. All in all, therefore, the state has much to do – and not everything that it does can be the subject of direct political attention.
Weberian bureaucracies
The reform of administration in the major European countries was actually started seriously in Prussia at the end of the eighteenth century: the principal reason for the administrative reform was military. It is perhaps appropriate then, that the principal theorist of modern bureaucracy,
Max Weber, was also German. Weber’s theory of bureaucracy described a system of rational administration, rule-bound and hierarchically organised. Most literature on modern bureaucracy refers to Weber’s notion. The Weberian bureaucrat was an official who was salaried, employed under contract and involved in pursuing a career. He had no financial interest in matters within his remit and no significant occupation outside his office. Initial recruitment was determined largely by examination with an internal system of promotions to determine who reached the top of the organisations.
   The main alternative to a Weberian system is a patronage system in which positions in the public administration are allocated by the head of government. Many systems do have some scope for political appointment to what might otherwise be regarded as essentially administrative positions. However, some do so to a much greater extent than others. In some Latin American countries, there are literally thousands of positions in the gift of the president. As a result, in these countries few highly qualified people seek posts in the career bureaucracy, except in a few ministries
or agencies where promotion on merit clearly exists. It is also a problem that any time that a government minister moves, there is a considerable turnover of senior personnel. This high rate of turnover can be damaging to efficiency.
Weber’s theory of bureaucratisation has attracted the attention of many scholars during the past century. The most important questions asked about government bureaucracy have to do with democracy (or, in more general terms, agency) and efficiency.
Bureaucracy and efficiency
It is important to note that Weber’s notion of bureaucratic rationality is not the same thing as efficiency, although there are areas of official
life – especially those connected with technical economic decision making – where Weberian systems do seem to work better in policy
terms than patronage systems. Weber was concerned with the internal logic of bureaucracy and the way in which bureaucratic behaviour was legitimated. These are important questions, but not the only ones that should be asked.
Efficiency is an increasingly demanding objective in the case of organisations that are entrusted to carry out complex and technically difficult tasks. Organisations can only work if there are some rules enforced by an element of coercion. However, organisations run purely
on a coercive basis are likely to be very bad at solving complex problems. Excessive authoritarianism may be bad for staff morale. Furthermore, situations will arise in almost any bureaucratic organisation that are not precisely covered by the rules. These situations can be dealt with creatively only if there is a willingness to improvise, and this requires accepting certain kinds of power relationship within the organisation. However, the nature and ability or inability of bureaucracies to improvise creatively relates to the political culture of the society as a whole.
Democratic control of bureaucracy
It is largely because efficiency is an important criterion for governments that the question of democratic control of bureaucracy is so difficult. At
its most abstract level, the question is one of agency. If B works for A,
how can A make sure that B does what A wants them to do – rather than what B wants to do? We encountered a similar problem when discussing electoral systems in Chapter 4, so we in fact have a double agency problem. We elect politicians in order to represent us, but they have minds of their own; the politicians may try to control the state, but senior state bureaucrats have minds of their own too. Control is largely dependent on having knowledge, but sophisticated bureaucracies have far more detailed knowledge of particular issues than professional politicians. This enables experts within the bureaucracy to present policy issues to politicians, or
to interpret ministerial directives in particular ways, which are themselves highly political and may not reflect what the elected government might have wanted. Public device theorists have argued that bureaucrats tend to want to increase their own powers and functions and will tend to advise politicians to adopt policies that are in the organisational interest of the bureaucracies themselves.
Bureaucrats in many democratic countries will also come into contact with organised interests of various kinds and this may lead to other influences being exerted on the system. The media and the law are both likely to be important constraints. Nobody wants to be at the receiving end of a bad press, while the law has become so demanding that it is now reasonably common for a bureaucrat to find themselves at the wrong end of an adverse legal judgment. Bureaucrats therefore have to be wary of people with access to the media and of people capable of pursuing an interest
in Court.
Those who seek to influence the bureaucracy by such means may include economic organisations (such as business corporations) or groups motivated more by a set of values or ideas than interests as such (the environmental lobby may be an example here). These external organisations may be able to provide specialised information that is
not widely available. In some cases, outside interests will use more controversial or disreputable means to influence the public bureaucracy. Outright bribery is relatively rare in First World countries, but it is not unknown.
Taking all of these factors together, critics of traditionally run government bureaucracies accuse them of ending up representing those interests that they theoretically exist to control, instead of representing the elected government of the day or public opinion in general. A British satirical programme discussed the role of several government agencies by saying that, ‘the Ministry of Agriculture represents farmers, the Ministry of Education represents teachers, and the Foreign Ministry represents foreigners.’ In recent years, this pattern of centralised bureaucratic organisation has been reformed in the light of contemporary theories of management. Hood (1998) argues that patterns of bureaucracy need to be congruent to the political culture of society as a whole. Hood regards Weberian patterns
of bureaucracy as ‘hierarchist’ – technically efficient, but also secretive, remote and inclined to defend authority even when authority is wrong. However, Hood’s alternative patterns of organising the state – egalitarian, individualist and fatalist – have problems of their own.
Some of the public administrative reforms introduced in Britain during the 1980s could be categorised as individualist. They gave greater weight to the efficient use of public money and less to the role of giving policy advice. Executive agencies have been decentralised from the
civil service and staffed in ways that are more typical of private sector organisations – although political factors are also taken into account. The word ‘quango’ (quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisation) has been coined to cover some of these agencies in Britain. This kind of reform can lead to financial savings but there are also dangers, including a lack
of bureaucratic coordination, an excessively narrow focus and – at the worst – outright corruption. Meanwhile the role that a more traditionalist bureaucracy would have been expected to play – namely, keeping things in some kind of balanced overall perspective – tended to go by default.
A combination of a desire to save public money, interest group pressure to pursue certain social objectives and a lack of central scrutiny led some ministers to propose – and get enacted – some well-meaning but very poorly thought-out legislation. Clientelism and semi-clientelism
The American system of administration is designed very differently. Although in theory there is a career bureaucracy in the United States, large numbers of senior positions are allocated by the president on a discretionary basis – often as a reward for political loyalty – that is, it is semi-clientelist. It is interesting that the USA did, in the early years of the republic, have a genuine state bureaucracy. However, this became less and less ‘bureaucratic’ and more clientelist as the nineteenth century wore on and party organisations and business interests became increasingly concerned to fill public offices. Today many of the important jobs within the US administration are political rather than bureaucratic appointments. Having said this, there are far fewer patronage appointments in the United States (relative to the size of the public bureaucracy as a whole) than
in a number of countries in Latin America. Some parts of the American bureaucracy can still be considered a career civil service. The military is one clear example. There is also a professional diplomatic service, although the top ambassadorships are often political appointments.
When the US government changes as a result of election (whether locally or nationally) there is a considerable turnover of government jobs.
Those who enjoy government positions are political activists, financial contributors to a political party or, sometimes, academic supporters. The loyalty of such people is generally to their immediate boss rather than to the civil service as such. Some will have political ambitions of their own, but most will stay in government for a limited period before going back into business or university life.
While this system may seem inefficient, it did prove to be a means of allowing party politics to develop in a country that did not have the acute class divisions or ideological forms of politics that developed in Europe. In most of Western Europe, political parties developed either around the Socialist–non/anti-Socialist axis, or around religious parties. In the USA, Socialism was never strong as a political doctrine and the separation of Church and state was required by the Constitution. The party system had to develop in a different way, and might have been weakened decisively without a clientelist system of public administration.
Disadvantages of clientelism
For the most part, political scientists have considered clientelism to be
less successful as a form of public administration than administrative professionalism. In its more extreme variants, clientelism can be inefficient. This is because a professional civil service is more likely to achieve competence through the acquisition of collective wisdom over many years and changes of government. A clientelist system will be composed of political appointees who will have to re-learn their job at the outset. When the minister leaves office, the entire ministerial team is likely to leave as well. In the Mexican case, for example, incoming ministerial teams have often started out with so little knowledge of their department that they did not always know the proper way to order stationery. Even more serious, outgoing teams often committed the state to contracts which had to be honoured by incoming teams that had no knowledge of the conditions that led them to be signed – or even of the contracts themselves.
Advantages of clientelism
However, a system that allows a limited role for clientelism has some advantages too. It does permit political leaders to bring in new people to look at existing procedures in a different way. Moreover, professional loyalty to the service can sometimes be damaging to the broader public interest, if the civil servants come to think that they know best. Some sort of mixture of bureaucratic and clientelistic principles may not be a bad arrangement. Some Latin American countries mix an essentially clientelist system of recruitment in some aspects of the state with a professional bureaucracy in other aspects – there can be ‘islands of Weberianism’ in the Central Bank, the Foreign Ministry, the statistical service, and some other areas. However, the mix is at present rather too heavily weighted toward clientelism and there is a lot of pressure for administrative reform in
the region. Good governance and its problems
In some developing countries, as we have noted, there has been considerable international pressure for reform to the bureaucracy. The World Bank developed a notion of ‘good governance’, which included
a measure of bureaucratic reform. The reason behind this is that
many loan programmes in developing countries, including economic adjustment programmes, failed because they were poorly managed. Better management, so it was argued, would translate into better policy performance and better economic results. However, World Bank efforts to produce ‘good government’ have met with serious difficulties. While most of us can identify bad government when we see it, it is much harder to form a consensus around good government. In the end, government is the product of political decisions taken in various parts of the political system. Political institutions matter, but they only work well if they are compatible with the political culture of the country concerned. If rules are not valued they are not likely to be reliably enforced. As we saw in Chapter 1, if they are not enforced, then we cannot speak of them as being institutionalised.
Therefore good government is only possible if the bureaucratic institutions responsible for maintaining it are somehow embedded in the culture of its own society. Governance cannot work well if the core assumptions behind the organisation of the main state bureaucracies are different from the assumptions governing public opinion in the society as a whole: this is especially true if the country concerned is a democracy.
Politics and the bureaucracy: a conclusion
A pure Weberian might claim that hierarchist patterns of bureaucracy
are largely inevitable in complex modern societies. It certainly can be claimed that Weberian patterns are often more efficient than other forms of bureaucratic organisation. However, there may be political reasons why alternative patterns of bureaucratic organisation might be preferred. Governments that are concerned above all with careful budgeting may prefer ideas of new public management. Politicians who need to build or strengthen a party system in societies that do not naturally divide into parties may prefer a clientelist system in order to create a reliable form of partisan division.
However, as with presidentialism, it is pointless to try to devise a system of public administration from scratch. Good bureaucratic practice is only possible when the political (and broader) culture is compatible with the mode of bureaucratic organisation selected. This is because bureaucratic practice invariably involves unwritten rules. Not everything can be written
   74 down or codified. If bureaucrats are forbidden to do what they consider natural, then the effect will be to cause confusion and paralysis, since nobody will take any action at all for fear of the consequences. This makes it very hard to achieve effective bureaucratic reform."

"as a democracy and democratisation expert, critically explain and analyse the main thesis  in a discursive way following the author's main train of thought, in detail :In 1996 the political scientist Samuel Huntington offered several
strong claims about the post-Cold War world.
Global politics was becoming not just “multipolar” but
“multicivilizational,” he argued, with competing powers
modernizing along different cultural lines, not simply converging
with the liberal West. “The balance of power among civilizations”
was shifting, and the West was entering a period of relative
decline. A “civilization-based world order” was emerging, in which
societies “sharing cultural affinities” were more likely to group
themselves into alliances or blocs. And the would-be universalism
of the West was setting the stage for sustained conflict with rival
civilizations, most notably with China and the Islamic world.
These claims were the backbone of Huntington’s book “The Clash
of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order,” which was seen
as a sweeping interpretive alternative to Francis Fukuyama’s “end
of history” thesis, with its vision of liberal democracy as the
horizon toward which post-Cold War societies were likely to
converge.
The Huntington thesis would seem ripe for new attention in the
wake of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the surprisingly
unified Western response, the more uncertain reactions from China
and India. But more often lately Huntington has been invoked
either warily, on the grounds that Putin wants a clash of
civilizations and we shouldn’t give it to him, or in dismissal or
critique, with the idea being that his theory of world politics has
actually been disproved by Putin’s attempt to restore a Greater
Russia.
That’s the argument offered, for instance, by the French scholar of Observateur. Roy describes the Ukraine war as “definitive proof Islam Olivier Roy in a recent interview with Le Nouvel
(because we have many others) that the ‘Clash of Civilizations’
theory does not work” — mostly because Huntington had predicted
that countries that share Orthodox Christianity would be unlikely
to go to war with one another, but instead here we have Putin’s
Russia making war, and not for the first time, against a largely
Orthodox Christian neighbor, even as he accommodates Muslim
constituencies inside Russia.
Writing for the new outsider journal Compact, a would-be home for
Huntington’s seemingly falsified predictions about Orthodox radicals of the left and right, Christopher Caldwell also invokes Christian unity. But then he also offers a different reason to reject
Huntington’s application to our moment, suggesting that the
civilizational model has been a useful framework for understanding
events over the last 20 years, but lately we have been moving back
to a world of explicitly ideological conflict — one defined by a
Western elite preaching a universal gospel of “neoliberalism” and
“wokeness,” and various regimes and movements that are trying to
resist it.

This is a right-wing reading of the global landscape, one hostile to the Western missionary zeal that it describes. But Caldwell’s
analysis resembles the popular liberal argument that the world is
increasingly divided between liberalism and authoritarianism,
democracy and autocracy, rather than being divided into multiple
poles and competing civilizations.
Yet both of those contemporary arguments offer weaker

invoked to explain the rise of jihadi terrorism, the Islamist
resistance to the power of the West.
But in every other theater of the world, his thesis looked relatively
dubious. American power didn’t seem to be obviously declining. some degree, not charting its own civilizational course. Russia in China was integrating with the Western world and liberalizing to
Putin’s first term seemed to aspire to alliances with America and
Europe and to a certain kind of democratic normalcy. In India the
forces of Hindu nationalism weren’t ascendant yet. And even in the
Muslim world, there were repeated moments, from the Green
Movement in Iran to the Arab Spring, that seemed to promise 1989-
style democratic revolutions followed by convergence with the
West.
The first years of the 21st century, in other words, provided a fair
amount of evidence for the universal appeal of Western capitalism,
liberalism and democracy, with outright opposition to those values
confined to the margins — Islamists, far-left critics of globalization,
the government of North Korea.
The last decade, on the other hand, has made Huntington’s
predictions of civilizational divergence look much more prescient.
It isn’t just that American power has obviously declined relative to
our rivals and competitors, or that our post-9/11 efforts to spread divergences between the world’s major powers have also followed, Western values by force of arms so often came to grief. The specific

Then what about Huntington’s specific predictions about Ukraine, raised by Roy and Caldwell in critique? Well, there he did get something wrong: Though he accurately foresaw internal Ukrainian divisions, the split between the Orthodox and Russian- speaking east and the more Catholic and Western-leaning west, his assumption that civilizational alignments would trump national ones hasn’t been borne out in Putin’s war, in which eastern Ukraine has resisted Russia fiercely.
That example fits a larger pattern: None of the emerging non- Western great powers have yet built grand alliances based on civilizational affinities, meaning that the third of the four big Huntingtonian predictions looks like the weakest one today. He imagined, for instance, that a rising China might be able to peacefully integrate Taiwan and maybe even draw Japan into its sphere of influence; that scenario seems highly unlikely at the moment. Instead, wherever smaller countries are somehow “torn,” in his language, between some other civilization and the liberal West, they usually prefer an American alliance to an alignment with Moscow or Beijing.
This speaks to the West’s resilient appeal, to enduring American advantages even in a multipolar world. But it doesn’t mean that liberalism is poised for some sweeping return to the position it occupied when American strength was at its height. None of the ambiguous and ambivalent reactions to Putin’s war outside the Euro-American alliance suggest a sudden springtime for the liberal-international world order. And while aspects of Fukuyama’s end of history have clearly spread beyond the liberal West, it’s as often the shadow side of his vision — consumerism and childless anomie — as the idealism of democracy and human rights.
Still less does the conflict in Ukraine mean that the export of American-style “wokeness,” however much it may preoccupy Putin, is poised to become the focal point for a new global ideological conflict. Quite the reverse: Most of wokeness feels inward-looking and parochial, a specifically Western and especially Anglo-American response to disappointments with the neoliberal period. Rather than offering a universal message, its key slogans and ideas really make sense only inside America and Europe — what could “interrogating whiteness” possibly mean to the middle class of Mumbai or Jakarta or to the young elites of Bahrain or Beijing? And it’s clearly tailored to an age of perceived American decline, offering a program of moral and spiritual renewal on the one hand but also a way to justify a certain mediocrity and torpor because, after all, too much focus on excellence or competition smacks of white supremacy.
Interestingly, the wokeness wars reveal another key thing that Huntington may have gotten wrong. His main fear for the Western world in an age of civilizational competition was that it would abandon its own cultural distinctiveness and that multiculturalism especially would be its undoing — that the United States might even fragment into English- and Spanish-speaking enclaves under the pressure of mass immigration. And some of the recent convergences between North American and Latin American politics — the growing appeal of right-wing populism and socialism in the United States, the rise of evangelicalism and Pentecostalism in South America — map onto those predictions.

But the battles over wokeness are not necessarily an example of ethnic Balkanization or multiculturalism gone too far. Instead the current culture war may actually be reducing ethnic polarization in our political parties — drawing some racial minorities rightward, for instance — while resurfacing some of the oldest divides in Anglo-American politics. The woke often seem like heirs of the New England Puritans and the utopian zeal of Yankeedom; their foes are often Southern evangelicals and conservative Catholics and the libertarian descendants of the Scots-Irish; and the stakes in the debates are competing interpretations of the American founding, the Constitution, the Civil War and the settlement of the frontier.
The present American culture war, then, vindicates Huntington in the larger sense, while cutting against one of his specific fears. Our various battles over race and sex, liberalism, education and religion, are indeed a response to a world that no longer takes American hegemony or liberal universalism for granted. But they aren’t — or at least aren’t yet — a surrender to dissolving forces, a post-American descent. Rather, if there’s going to be a clash of civilizations, the clash inside America is over what kind of civilization ours should be."
"I can't understand this FPA question: Do transnational actors employ diplomacy to impact the foreign policy ideology of states, or do their efforts primarily target influencing state actions?"
"as a foreign policy analysis expert, critically explain and analyse the main thesis  in a discursive way following the author's main train of thought, in detail : 

I should explain by way of introduction that I was in the Soviet Union during the summer of 1960, about a month after the U-2 incident. The primary purpose of my trip was to become acquainted with scientific developments in my field, which is social psychology. But in addition to visiting laboratories at universities and institutes, I wanted also to become acquainted with living social psychology-the Soviet people themselves. It was my good fortune to be able to speak Russian, I was traveling with a tourist visa on a new plan which permitted me to go about alone without a guide. Accordingly, after spending the first two or three days of my visit in a particular city at scientific centers, I would devote the remaining days to walking about the town and striking up conversations with people in public conveyances, parks, stores, restaurants, or just on the street. Since foreigners are a curiosity, and I was obviously a foreigner (though, I quickly learned, not obviously an American), people were eager to talk. But I also went out of my way to strike up conversations with people who weren't taking the initiative- with fellow passengers who were remaining silent, with strollers in the park, with children and old people. Or I would enter a restaurant deciding in advance to sit at the third table on the left with whoever should turn out to be there. (In Soviet res- taurants it is not uncommon to share a table with strangers.) These conversations convinced me that the great majority of Russians feel a genuine pride in the accomplishments of their system and a conviction that communism is the way of the future not only for themselves but for the rest of the world as well. For several reasons my Soviet journey was a deeply dis- turbing experience. But what frightened me was not so much the facts of Soviet reality as the discrepancy between the real and the perceived. At first I was troubled only by the strange irrationality of the Soviet view of the world—especially their gross distortion of American society and American foreign policy as I knew them to be. But then, gradually, there came an even more disquieting awareness-an awareness which I resisted and still resist. Slowly and painfully, it forced itself upon me that the Russian's distorted picture of us was curiously similar to our view of them-a mirror image. But of course our image was real. Or could it be that our views too were distorted and irrational-a mirror image in a twisted glass?
It was and is a frightening prospect. For if such reciprocal distortion exists, it is a psychological phenomenon without parallel in the gravity of its consequences. For this reason, the possibility deserves serious consideration.
The Mirror Image Magnified
Let us then briefly examine the common features in the American and Soviet view of each other's societies. For the Russian's image I drew mainly, not on official government pronouncements, but on what was said to me by Soviet citizens in the course of our conversations. Five major themes stand
out.
1. THEY ARE THE AGGRESSORS
The American view: Russia is the warmonger bent on imposing its system on the rest of the world. Witness Czechoslovakia,
Berlin, Hungary, and now Cuba and the Congo. The Soviet Union consistently blocks Western proposals for disarmament by refusing necessary inspection controls.
The Soviet view: America is the warmonger bent on imposing its power on the rest of the world and on the Soviet Union itself. Witness American intervention in 1918; Western encir- clement after World War II with American troops and bases on every border of the USSR (West Germany, Norway, Turkey, Korea, Japan); intransigence over proposals to make Berlin a free city; intervention in Korea, Taiwan, Lebanon, Guatemala, Cuba. America has repeatedly rejected Soviet disarmament pro- posals while demanding the right to inspect within Soviet ter- ritory-finally attempting to take the right by force through deep penetration of Soviet airspace.
2. THEIR GOVERNMENT EXPLOITS AND DELUDES THE PEOPLE
The American view: Convinced communists, who form but a small proportion of Russia's population, control the govern- ment and exploit the society and its resources in their own interest. To justify their power and expansionist policies they have to perpetuate a war atmosphere and a fear of Western aggression. Russian elections are a travesty, since only one party appears on the ballot. The Russian people are kept from knowing the truth through a controlled radio and press, and conformity is insured through stringent economic and political sanctions against deviant individuals or groups.
The Soviet view: A capitalistic-militaristic clique controls the American government, the nation's economic resources, and its media of communication. The group exploits the society and its resources. It is in their economic and political interest to maintain a war atmosphere and engage in militaristic expansion. Voting in America is a farce, since candidates for both parties are selected by the same powerful interests leaving nothing to choose between. The American people are kept from knowing the truth through a controlled radio and press and through economic and political sanctions against liberal elements.
3. THE MASS OF THEIR PEOPLE ARE NOT REALLY SYMPATHETIC TO THE REGIME
The American view: In spite of the propaganda, the Soviet people are not really behind their government. Their praise of the government and the party is largely perfunctory, a necessary concession for getting along. They do not trust their own sources of information and have learned to read between the lines. Most of them would prefer to live under our system of gov- ernment if they only could.
The Soviet view: Unlike their government, the bulk of the American people want peace. Thus, the majority disapproved of American aggression in Korea, the support of Chiang Kai- shek, and above all, of the sending of U-2. But of course they could do nothing, since their welfare is completely under the control of the ruling financier-militaristic clique. If the American people were allowed to become acquainted with communism as it exists in the USSR, they would unquestionably choose it as their form of government. (""You Americans are such a nice people; it is a pity you have such a terrible government."")
4. THEY CANNOT BE TRUSTED
The American view: The Soviets do not keep promises and they do not mean what they say. Thus, while they claim to have discontinued all nuclear testing, they are probably carrying out secret underground explosions in order to gain an advantage over us. Their talk of peace is but a propaganda maneuver. Everything they do is to be viewed with suspicion, since it is all part of a single coordinated scheme to further aggressive communist aims.
The Soviet view: The Americans do not keep promises and they do not mean what they say. Thus, they insist on inspection only so that they can look at Soviet defenses; they have no real intention of disarming. Everything the Americans do is to be viewed with suspicion (e.g., they take advantage of Soviet hos- pitality by sending in spies as tourists).
5. THEIR POLICY VERGES ON MADNESS
The American view: Soviet demands on such crucial problems as disarmament, Berlin, and unification are completely unreal- istic. Disarmament without adequate inspection is meaningless; a ""free Berlin"" would be equivalent to a Soviet Berlin; and a united Germany without free elections is an impossibility. In pursuit of their irresponsible policies the Soviets do not hesitate to run the risk of war itself. Thus, it only due to the restraint and coordinated action of the Western alliance that Soviet provocations over Berlin did not precipitate World War III.
The Soviet view: The American position on such crucial problems as disarmament, East Germany, and China is com- pletely unrealistic. They demand to know our secrets before they disarm; in Germany they insist on a policy which risks the resurgence of a fascist Reich; and as for China, they try to act as if it did not exist while at the same time supporting an aggressive puppet regime just off the Chinese mainland. And, in pursuit of their irresponsible policies, the Americans do not hesitate to run the risk of war itself. Were it not for Soviet prudence and restraint, the sending of a U-2 deep into Russian territory could easily have precipitated World War III.
It is easy to recognize the gross distortions in the Soviet views summarized above. But is our own outlook completely realistic? Are we correct, for example, in thinking that the mass of the Soviet people would really prefer our way of life and are unenthusiastic about their own? Certainly the tone and tenor of my conversations with Soviet citizens hardly support this belief.
But, you may ask, why is it that other Western observers do not report the enthusiasm and commitment which I encoun- tered?
I asked this very question of newspapermen and embassy officials in Moscow. Their answers were revealing. Thus one reporter replied somewhat dryly, ""Sure, I know, but when a communist acts like a communist, it isn't news. If I want to be sure that it will be printed back home, I have to write about what's wrong with the system, not its successes."" Others voiced an opinion expressed most clearly by representatives at our  embassy. When I reported to them the gist of my Soviet con- versations, they were grateful but skeptical: ""Professor, you underestimate the effect of the police state. When these people talk to a stranger, especially an American, they have to say the right thing.""
The argument is persuasive, and comforting to hear. But perhaps these very features should arouse our critical judgment. Indeed, it is instructive to view this argument against the back- ground of its predecessor voiced by the newspaperman. To put it bluntly, what he was saying was that he could be sure of getting published only the material that the American people wanted to hear. But notice that the second argument also fulfills this objective, and it does so in a much more satisfactory and sophisticated way. The realization that ""Soviet citizens have to say the right thing"" enables the Western observer not only to discount most of what he hears but even to interpret it as evidence in direct support of the West's accepted picture of the Soviet Union as a police state.
It should be clear that I am in no sense here suggesting that Western reporters and embassy officials deliberately misrepresent what they know to be the facts. Rather, I am calling attention to the operation, in a specific and critical context, of a phe- nomenon well known to psychologists-the tendency to assim- ilate new perceptions to old, and unconsciously to distort what one sees in such a way as to minimize a clash with previous expectations. In recent years, a number of leading social psy- chologists, notably Heider (1958), Festinger (1957), and Osgood (1960), have emphasized that this ""strain toward consistency"" is especially powerful in the sphere of social relations-that is, in our perceptions of the motives, attitudes, and actions of other persons or groups. Specifically, we strive to keep our views of other human beings compatible with each other. In the face of complex social reality, such consistency is typically accomplished by obliterating distinctions and organizing the world in terms of artificially simplified frames of reference. One of the simplest of these, and hence one of the most inviting, is the dichotomy of good and bad. Hence we often perceive others, be they individuals, groups, or even whole societies, as simply ""good"" or ""bad."" Once this fateful decision is made, the rest is easy,

for the ""good"" person or group can have only desirable social characteristics and the ""bad"" can have only reprehensible traits. And once such evaluative stability of social perception is es- tablished, it is extremely difficult to alter. Contradictory stimuli arouse only anxiety and resistance. When confronted with a desirable characteristic of something already known to be ""bad,"" the observer will either just not ""see"" it, or will reorganize his perception of it so that it can be perceived as ""bad."" Finally, this tendency to regress to simple categories of perception is especially strong under conditions of emotional stress and ex- ternal threat. Witness our readiness in times of war to exalt the virtues of our own side and to see the enemy as thoroughly evil.
Still one other social-psychological phenomenon has direct relevance for the present discussion. I refer to a process dem- onstrated most dramatically and comprehensively in the ex- periments of Solomon Asch (1956), and known thereby as the ""Asch phenomenon."" In these experiments, the subject finds himself in a group of six or eight of his peers, all of whom are asked to make comparative judgments of certain stimuli pre- sented to them; for example, identifying the longer of two lines. At first the task seems simple enough; the subject hears others make their judgments and then makes his own. In the beginning he is usually in agreement, but then gradually he notices that more and more often his judgments differ from those of the rest of the group. Actually, the experiment is rigged. All the other group members have been instructed to give false responses on a predetermined schedule. In any event, the effect on our subject is dramatic. At first he is puzzled, then upset. Soon he begins to have serious doubts about his own judgment, and in an appreciable number of cases, he begins to ""see"" the stimuli as they are described by his fellows.
What I am suggesting, of course, is that the Asch phenomenon operates even more forcefully outside the laboratory where the game of social perception is being played for keeps. Specifically, I am proposing that the mechanisms here described contribute substantially to producing and maintaining serious distortions in the reciprocal images of the Soviet Union and the United States.
My suggestion springs from more than abstract theoretical inference. I call attention to the possible operation of the Asch phenomenon in the Soviet-American context for a very concrete reason: I had the distressing experience of being its victim. While in the Soviet Union I deliberately sought to minimize association with other westerners and to spend as much time as I could with Soviet citizens. This was not easy to do. It was no pleasant experience to hear one's own country severely criticized and to be constantly outdebated in the bargain. I looked forward to the next chance meeting with a fellow westerner so that I could get much-needed moral support and enjoy an evening's invective at the expense of Intourist and the ""worker's paradise."" But though I occasionally yielded to temptation, for the most part I kept true to my resolve and spent many hours in a completely Soviet environment. It was difficult but interesting. I liked many of the people I met. Some of them apparently liked me. Though mistaken, they were obviously sincere. They wanted me to agree with them. The days went on, and strange things began to happen. I remember picking up a Soviet newspaper which featured an account of American activities in the Near East. ""Oh, what are they doing now!"" I asked myself, and stopped short; for I had thought in terms of ""they,"" and it was my own country. Or I would become aware that I had been nodding to the points being made by my Soviet companion where before I had always taken issue. In short, when all around me saw the world in one way, I too found myself wanting to believe and belong.
And once I crossed the Soviet border on my way home, the process began to reverse itself. The more I talked with fellow westerners, especially fellow Americans, the more I began to doubt the validity of my original impressions. ""What would you expect them to say to an American?"" my friends would ask. ""How do you know that the person talking to you was not a trained agitator?"" ""Did you ever catch sight of them following you?"" I never did. Perhaps I was naive. But then, recently I reread a letter written to a friend during the last week of my stay. ""I feel it is important,"" it begins, ""to try to write to you in detail while I am still in it, for just as I could never have conceived of what I am now experiencing, so, I suspect,
it will seem unreal and intangible once I am back in the West."" The rest of the letter, and others like it, contain the record of the experiences reported in this account.
In sum, I take my stand on the view that there is a mirror image in Soviet and American perceptions of each other and that this image represents serious distortions by both parties of realities on either side.
The Mirror Image Projected
And if so, what then? Do not distortions have adaptive functions? Especially in war is it not psychologically necessary to see the enemy as thoroughly evil and to enhance one's self- image? And are we not engaged in a war, albeit a cold war, with the Soviet Union?
But is not our hope to bring an end to the cold war and, above all, to avoid the holocaust of a hot one? And herein lies the terrible danger of the distorted mirror image, for it is characteristic of such images that they are self-confirming, that is, each party, often against its own wishes, is increasingly driven to behave in a manner which fulfills the expectations of the other. As revealed in social-psychological studies, the mechanism is a simple one: if A expects B to be friendly and acts accordingly, B responds with friendly advances; these in turn evoke additional positive actions from A, and thus a benign circle is set in motion. Conversely, where A's anticipations of B are unfavor- able, it is the vicious circle which develops at an accelerating pace. And as tensions rise, perceptions become more primitive and still further removed from reality. Seen from this perspective, the primary danger of the Soviet-American mirror image is that it impels each nation to act in a manner which confirms and enhances the fear of the other to the point that even deliberate efforts to reverse the process are reinterpreted as evidences of confirmation.
Manifestations of this mechanism in Soviet-American rela- tions are not difficult to find. A case in point is our policy of restricting the travel of Soviet nationals in the United States by designating as ""closed areas"" localities that correspond as closely as possible to those initially selected by Soviet authorities as ""off limits"" to Americans in the USSR. As was brought home to me in conversations with Soviet scientists who had visited the United States, one of the effects of this policy is to neutralize substantially any favorable impressions the visitor might other- wise get of American freedoms.
To take another example in a more consequential area: in a recent issue of Atlantic Monthly (August 1960), Dr. Hans Bethe, an American physicist who participated in negotiations at the Geneva Conference on nuclear testing, reports that our tendency to expect trickery from the Soviets led us into spending con- siderable time and energy to discover scientific loopholes in their proposals which could have permitted them to continue nuclear tests undetected. As a result, our scientists did succeed in finding a theoretical basis for questioning the effectiveness of the Soviet plan. It seems that if the Soviets could dig a hole big enough, they could detonate underground explosions without being detected. Says Dr. Bethe:
I had the doubtful honor of presenting the theory of the big hole to the Russians in Geneva in November 1959. I felt deeply embarrassed in so doing, because it implied that we considered the Russians capable of cheating on a massive scale. I think they would have been quite justified if they had considered this an insult and walked out of the negotiations in disgust.
The Russians seemed stunned by the theory of the big hole. In private, they took Americans to task for having spent the last year inventing methods to cheat on a nuclear test cessation agreement. Officially, they spent considerable effort in trying to disprove the theory of the big hole. This is not the reaction of a country that is bent on cheating.
But the most frightful potential consequence of the mirror image lies in the possibility that it may confirm itself out of existence. For if it is possible for either side to interpret conces- sions as signs of treachery, it should not be difficult to recognize an off-course satellite as a missile on its way. After all, we, or they, would be expecting it.
But it is only in the final catastrophe that the mirror image is impartial in its effects. Short of doomsday, we have even

more to lose from the accelerating vicious circle than do the Soviets. Internally, the communist system can justify itself to the Soviet people far more easily in the face of external threat than in times of peace. And in the international arena, the more the United States becomes committed to massive retal- iation and preventive intervention abroad, the more difficult it becomes for uncommitted or even friendly nations to perceive a real difference in the foreign policies of East and West.
Breaking the Mirror Image
How can we avoid such awesome consequences? One step seems clearly indicated: we must do everything we can to break down the psychological barrier that prevents both us and the Russians from seeing each other and ourselves as we really are. If we can succeed in dispelling the Soviet Union's bogeyman picture of America, we stand to gain, for to the same degree that militant communism thrives in a context of external threat, it is weakened as this threat is reduced. And as the raison d'être for sacrifice, surveillance, and submission disappears there arises opportunity for the expression of such potential for liberalization as may still exist in Russian society."

"as an international political thoery  expert, critically explain and analyse the main thesis   in a discursive way following the author's main train if thought: Women’s role in production: its effect upon the family
Will the family continue to exist under communism? Will the family remain in the same form? These questions are troubling many women of the working class and worrying their menfolk as well. Life is changing before our very eyes; old habits and customs are dying out, and the whole life of the proletarian family is developing in a way that is new and unfamiliar and, in the eyes of some, “bizarre”. No wonder that working women are beginning to think these questions over. Another fact that invites attention is that divorce has been made easier in Soviet Russia. The decree of the Council of People’s Commissars issued on 18 December 1917 means that divorce is, no longer a luxury that only the rich can afford; henceforth, a working woman will not have to petition for months or even for years to secure the right to live separately from a husband who beats her and makes her life a misery with his drunkenness and uncouth behaviour. Divorce by mutual agreement now takes no more than a week or two to obtain. Women who are unhappy in their married life welcome this easy divorce. But others, particularly those who are used to looking upon their husband as “breadwinners”, are frightened. They have not yet understood that a woman must accustom herself to seek and find support in the collective and in society, and not from the individual man.
There is no point in not facing up to the truth: the old family in which the man was everything and the woman nothing, the typical family where the woman had no will of her own, no time of her own and no money of her own, is changing before our very eyes. But there is no need for alarm. It is only our ignorance that leads us to think that the things we are used to can never change. Nothing could be less true than the saying “as it was, so it shall be”. We have only to read how people lived in the past to see that everything is subject to change and that no customs, political organisations or moral principles are fixed and inviolable. In the course of history, the structure of the family has changed many times; it was once quite different from the family of today. There was a time when the kinship family was considered the norm: the mother headed a family consisting of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who lived and worked together. At another period the patriarchal family was the rule. In this case it was the father whose will was law for all the other members of the family: even today such families may be found among the peasantry in the Russian villages. Here the morals and customs of family life are not those of the urban proletariat. In the countryside, they observe norms which the worker has long forgotten. The structure of the family and the customs of family life also vary from nation to nation. Among some peoples such as the Turks. Arabs and Persians, a man is allowed to have several wives. There have been and there still are tribes where the woman may have several husbands. We are used to the fact that a young girl is expected to remain a virgin until marriage; however, there are tribes where it is a matter of pride to have had many lovers and where the women decorate their arms and legs with the corresponding number of bracelets. Many practices which might astonish us and which might even seem immoral are considered by other peoples to be quite normal and they, in their turn, consider our laws and customs “sinful”. There is, therefore, no reason to be frightened of the fact that the family is in the process of change, and that outdated and unnecessary things are being discarded and new relations between men and women developing our job is to decide which aspects of our family system are outdated and to determine what relations, between the men and women of the working and peasant classes and which rights and duties would best harmonise with the conditions of life in the new workers’ Russia. That which is in be With the new life should be maintained, while all that is old and outdated and derives from the cursed epoch of servitude and domination, of landed proprietors and capitalists, should be swept aside together with the exploiting class itself and the other enemies of the proletariat and the poor.
The type of family to which the urban and rural proletariat has grown accustomed is one of these, legacies of the past. There was a time when the isolated, firmly-knit family, based on a church wedding, was equally necessary to all its members. If there had been no family, who would have fed, clothed and brought up the children? Who would have given them advice? In days gone by, to be an orphan was one of the worst fates imaginable. In the family of old, the husband earns and orts his wife and children. The wife for her part is occupied with housekeeping and with bringing up the children as best she can. But over the last hundred years this customary family structure has been falling apart in all the countries where capitalism is dominant and where the number of factories and other enterprises which employ hired labour is increasing. The customs and moral principles of family life are changing as the general conditions of life change. It is the universal spread of female labour that has contributed most of all to the radical change in family life. Formerly only the man was considered a breadwinner. But Russian women have for the past fifty or sixty years (and in other capitalist countries for a somewhat longer period of time) been forced to seek paid work outside the family and outside the home. The wages of the “breadwinner” being insufficient for the needs of the family, the woman found herself obliged to look for a wage and to knock at the factory door. With every year the number of working-class women starting work outside the home as day labourers, saleswomen, clerks, washerwomen and servants increased. Statistics show that in 1914, before the outbreak of the First World War, there were about sixty million women earning their own living in the countries of Europe and America, and during the war this number increased considerably. Almost half of these women are married. What kind of family life they must have can easily be imagined. What kind of “family life” can there be if the wife and mother is out at work for at least eight hours and, counting the travelling, is away from home for ten hours a day? Her home is neglected; the children grow up without any maternal care, spending most of the time out on the streets, exposed to all the dangers of this environment. The woman who is wife, mother and worker has to expend every ounce of energy to fulfil these roles. She has to work the same hours as her husband in some factory, printing-house or commercial establishment and then on top of that she has to find the time to attend to her household and look after her children. Capitalism has placed a crushing burden on woman’s shoulders: it has made her a wage-worker without having reduced her cares as housekeeper or mother. Woman staggers beneath the weight of this triple load. She suffers, her face is always wet with tears. Life has never been easy for woman, but never has her lot been harder and more desperate than that of the millions of working women under the capitalist yoke in this heyday of factory production.
The family breaks down as more and more women go out to work. How can one talk about family life when the man and woman work different shifts, and where the wife does not even have the time to prepare a decent meal for her offspring? How can one talk of parents when the mother and father are out working all day and cannot find the time to spend even a few minutes with their children? It was quite different in the old days. The mother remained at home and occupied herself with her household duties; her children were at her side, under her watchful eye. Nowadays the working woman hastens out of the house early in the morning when the factory whistle blows. When evening comes and the whistle sounds again, she hurries home to scramble through the most pressing of her domestic tasks. Then it’s oil to work again the next morning, and she is tired from lack of sleep. For the married working woman, life is as had as the workhouse. It is not surprising therefore that family ties should loosen and the family begin to fall apart. The circumstances that held the family together no longer exist. The family is ceasing to be necessary either to its members or to the nation as a whole. The old family structure is now merely a hindrance. What used to make the old family so strong? First, because the husband and father was the family’s breadwinner; secondly, because the family economy was necessary to all its members: and thirdly, because children were brought up by their parents. What is left of this former type of family? The husband, as we have just seen, has ceased to he the sole breadwinner. The wife who goes to work earns wages. She has learned to cam her own living, to support her children and not infrequently her husband. The family now only serves as the primary economic unit of society and the supporter and educator of young children. Let us examine the matter in more detail, to see whether or not the family is about to be relieved of these tasks as well.
Housework ceases to be necessary
There was a time when the women of the poorer classes in city and country spent their entire lives within the four walls of the home. A woman knew nothing beyond the threshold of her own home, and in most cases had no wish to know anything. After all, in her own home, there was so much to do, and this work was most necessary and useful not only for the family itself but also for the state as a whole. The woman did everything that the modern working and peasant woman has to do, but besides this cooking, washing, cleaning and mending, she spun wool and linen, wove cloth and garments, knitted stockings, made lace, prepared – as far as her resources permitted – all sorts of pickles, jams and other preserves for winter, and manufactured, her own candles. It is difficult to make a complete list of all her duties. That is how our mothers and grandmothers lived. Even today you may still come across remote villages deep in the country, far from the railroads and the big rivers, where this mode of life has been preserved and where the mistress of the house is overburdened with all kinds of chores over which the working woman of the big cities and of the populous industrial regions has long ceased to worry.
In our grandmother’s day, all this domestic work was necessary and beneficial; it ensured the well-being of the family. The more the mistress of the house applied herself, the better the peasant or craftsman’s family lived. Even the national economy benefited from the housewife’s activity, for the woman did not limit herself to making soup and cooking potatoes (i.e. satisfying the Immediate needs of the family), she also produced such things as cloth, thread, butter, etc. which had a value as commodities that could be sold on the market. And every man, whether peasant or worker, tried to find a wife who had “hands of gold”, for he knew that a family could not get along without this “domestic labour”. The interests of the whole nation were involved, for the more work the woman and the other members of the family put into making cloth, leather and wool (the surplus of which was sold in the neighbouring market), the greater the economic prosperity of the country as a whole.
But capitalism has changed all this. All that was formerly produced in the bosom of the family is now being manufactured on a mass scale in workshops and factories. The machine has superseded the wife. What housekeeper would now bother to make candles, spin wool or weave, cloth? All these products can be bought in the shop next door, formerly every girl would learn to knit stockings. Nowadays, what working woman would think of making her own? In the first place she doesn’t have the time. Time is money, and no one wants to waste time in an unproductive and useless manner. Few working women would start to pickle cucumbers or make other preserves when all these things can be bought in the shop. Even if the products sold in the store are of an inferior quality and not prepared with the care of the home-made equivalent the working woman has neither the time nor the energy needed to 1 perform these domestic operations. First and foremost she is a hired worker. Thus the family economy is gradually being deprived of all the domestic work without which our grandmothers could hardly have imagined a family. What was formerly produced in the family is now produced by the collective labour of working men and women in the factories.
The family no longer produces; it only consumes. The housework that remains consists of cleaning (cleaning the floors, dusting, heating water, care of the lamps etc.), cooking (preparation of dinners and suppers), washing and the care of the linen and clothing of the “family (darning and mending). These are difficult and exhausting tasks and they absorb all the spare time and energy of the working woman who must, in addition, put in her hours at a factory. But this work is different in one important way from the work our grandmothers did: the four tasks enumerated above, which still serve to keep the family together, are of no value to the state and the national economy, for they do not create any new values or make any contribution to the prosperity of the country. The housewife may spend all day, from morning to evening, cleaning her home, she may wash and iron the linen daily, make every effort to keep her clothing in good order and prepare whatever dishes she pleases and her modest resources allow, and she will still end the day without having created any values. Despite her industry she would not have made anything that could be considered a commodity. Even if a working woman were to live a thousand years, she would still have to begin every day from the beginning. There would always be a new layer of dust to be removed from the mantelpiece, her husband would always come in hungry and her children bring in mud on their shoes.
Women’s work is becoming less useful to the community as a whole. It is becoming unproductive. The individual household is dying. It is giving way in our society to collective housekeeping. Instead of the working woman cleaning her flat, the communist society can arrange for men and women whose job it is to go round in the morning cleaning rooms. The wives of the rich have long since been freed from these irritating and tiring domestic duties. Why should working woman continue to be burdened with them? In Soviet Russia the working woman should be surrounded by the same ease and light, hygiene and beauty that previously only the very rich could afford. Instead of the working woman having to struggle with the cooking and spend her last free hours in the kitchen preparing dinner and supper, communist society win organise public restaurants and communal kitchens.
Even under capitalism such establishments have begun to appear. In fact over the last half a century the number of restaurants and cafes in all the great cities of Europe has been growing daily; they are springing up like mushrooms after the autumn rain. But under capitalism only people with well-lined purses can afford to take their meals in restaurants, while under communism everyone will be able to eat in the communal kitchens and dining-rooms. The working woman will not have to slave over the washtub any longer, or ruin her eyes in darning her stockings and mending her linen; she will simply take these things to the central laundries each week and collect the washed and ironed garments later. That will be another job less to do. Special clothes-mending centres will free the working woman from the hours spent on mending and give her the opportunity to devote her evenings to reading, attending meetings and concerts. Thus the four categories of housework are doomed to extinction with the victory of communism. And the working woman will surely have no cause to regret this. Communism liberates worm from her domestic slavery and makes her life richer and happier.
The state is responsible for the upbringing of children
But even if housework disappears, you may argue, there are still the children to look after. But here too, the workers’ state will come to replace the family, society will gradually take upon itself all the tasks that before the revolution fell to the individual parents. Even before the revolution, the instruction of the child had ceased to be the duty of the parents. Once the children had attained school age the parents could breathe more freely, for they were no longer responsible for the intellectual development of their offspring. But there were still plenty of obligations to fulfil. There was still the matter of feeding the children, buying them shoes and clothes and seeing that they developed into skilled and honest workers able, when the time came, to earn their own living and feed and support their parents in old age. Few workers’ families however, were able to fulfil these obligations. Their low wages did not enable them to give the children enough to eat, while lack of free time prevented them from devoting the necessary attention to the education of the rising generation. The family is supposed to bring up the children, but in reality proletarian children grow up on the streets. Our forefathers knew some family life, but the children of the proletariat know none. Furthermore, the parents’ small income and the precarious position in which the family is placed financially often force the child to become an independent worker at scarcely ten years of age. And when children begin, to earn their own money they consider themselves their own masters, and the words and counsels of the parents are no longer law; the authority of the parents weakens, and obedience is at an end.
Just as housework withers away, so the obligations of parents to their children wither away gradually until finally society assumes the full responsibility. Under capitalism children were frequently, too frequently, a heavy and unbearable burden on the proletarian family. Communist society will come to the aid of the parents. In Soviet Russia the Commissariats of Public Education and of Social Welfare are already doing much to assist the family. We already have homes for very small babies, creches, kindergartens, children’s colonies and homes, hospitals and health resorts for sick children. restaurants, free lunches at school and free distribution of text books, warm clothing and shoes to schoolchildren. All this goes to show that the responsibility for the child is passing from the family to the collective.
The parental care of children in the family could be divided into three parts: (a) the care of the very young baby, (b) the bringing up of the child, and (c) the instruction of the child. Even in capitalist society the education of the child in primary schools and later in secondary and higher educational establishments became the responsibility of the state. Even in capitalist society the needs of the workers were to some extent met by the provision of playgrounds, kindergartens, play groups, etc. The more the workers became conscious of their rights and the better they were organised, the more society had to relieve the family of the care of the children. But bourgeois society was afraid of going too far towards meeting the interests of the working class, lest this contribute to the break-up of the family. For the capitalists are well aware that the old type of family, where the woman is a slave and where the husband is responsible for the well-being of his wife and children, constitutes the best weapon in the struggle to stifle the desire of the working class for freedom and to weaken the revolutionary spirit of the working man and working woman. The worker is weighed down by his family cares and is obliged to compromise with capital. The father and mother are ready to agree to any terms when their children are hungry. Capitalist society has not been able to transform education into a truly social and state matter because the property owners, the bourgeoisie, have been against this.
Communist society considers the social education of the rising generation to be one of the fundamental aspects of the new life. The old family, narrow and petty, where the parents quarrel and are only interested in their own offspring, is not capable of educating the “new person”. The playgrounds, gardens, homes and other amenities where the child will spend the greater part of the day under the supervision of qualified educators will, on the other hand, offer an environment in which the child can grow up a conscious communist who recognises the need for solidarity, comradeship, mutual help and loyalty to the collective. What responsibilities are left to the parents, when they no longer have to take charge of upbringing and education? The very small baby, you might answer, while it is still learning to walk and clinging to its mother’s skirt, still needs her attention. Here again the communist state hastens to the aid of the working mother. No longer will there be any women who are alone. The workers’ state aims to support every mother, married or unmarried, while she is suckling her child, and to establish maternity homes, day nurseries and other such facilities in every city and village, in order to give women the opportunity to combine work in society with maternity.
Working mothers have no need to be alarmed; communist not intending to take children away from their parents or to tear the baby from the breast of its mother, and neither is it planning to take, violent measures to destroy the family. No such thing! The aims of communist society are quite different. Communist society sees that the old type of family is breaking up, and that all the old pillars which supported the family as a social unit are being removed: the domestic economy is dying, and working-class parents are unable to take care of their children or provide them with sustenance and education. Parents and children suffer equally from this situation. Communist society has this to say to the working woman and working man: “You are young, you love each other. Everyone has the right to happiness. Therefore live your life. Do not flee happiness. Do not fear marriage, even though under capitalism marriage was truly a chain of sorrow. Do not be afraid of having children. Society needs more workers and rejoices at the birth of every child. You do not have to worry about the future of your child; your child will know neither hunger nor cold.” Communist society takes care of every child and guarantees both him and his mother material and moral support. Society will feed, bring up and educate the child. At the same time, those parents who desire to participate in the education of their children will by no, means be prevented from doing so. Communist society will take upon itself all the duties involved in the education of the child, but the joys of parenthood will not be taken away from those who are capable of appreciating them. Such are the plans of communist society and they can hardly be interpreted as the forcible destruction of the family and the forcible separation of child from mother.
There is no escaping the fact: the old type of family has had its day. The family is withering away not because it is being forcibly destroyed by the state, but because the family is ceasing to be a necessity. The state does not need the family, because the domestic economy is no longer profitable: the family distracts the worker from more useful and productive labour. The members of the family do not need the family either, because the task of bringing up the children which was formerly theirs is passing more and more into the hands of the collective. In place of the old relationship between men and women, a new one is developing: a union of affection and comradeship, a union of two equal members of communist society, both of them free, both of them independent and both of them workers. No more domestic bondage for women. No more inequality within the family. No need for women to fear being left without support and with children to bring up. The woman in communist society no longer depends upon her husband but on her work. It is not in her husband but in her capacity for work that she will find support. She need have no anxiety about her children. The workers’ state will assume responsibility for them. Marriage will lose all the elements of material calculation which cripple family life. Marriage will be a union of two persons who love and trust each other. Such a union promises to the working men and women who understand themselves and the world around them the most complete happiness and the maximum satisfaction. Instead of the conjugal slavery of the past, communist society offers women and men a free union which is strong in the comradeship which inspired it. Once the conditions of labour have been transformed and the material security of the working women has increased, and once marriage such as the church used to perform it – this so-called indissoluble marriage which was at bottom merely a fraud – has given place to the free and honest union of men and women who are lovers and comrades, prostitution will disappear. This evil, which is a stain on humanity and the scourge of hungry working women, has its roots in commodity production and the institution of private property. Once these economic forms are superseded, the trade in women will automatically disappear. The women of the working class, therefore, need not worry over the fact that the family is doomed to disappear. They should, on the contrary, welcome the dawn of a new society which will liberate women from domestic servitude, lighten the burden of motherhood and finally put an end to the terrible curse of prostitution.
The woman who takes up the struggle for the liberation of the working class must learn to understand that there is no more room for the old proprietary attitude which says: “These are my children, I owe them all my maternal solicitude and affection; those are your children, they are no concern of mine and I don’t care if they go hungry and cold – I have no time for other children.” The worker-mother must learn not to differentiate between yours and mine; she must remember that there are only our children, the children of Russia’s communist workers.
The workers’ state needs new relations between the sexes, just as the narrow and exclusive affection of the mother for her own children must expand until it extends to all the children of the great, proletarian family, the indissoluble marriage based on the servitude of women is replaced by a free union of two equal members of the workers’ state who are united by love and mutual respect. In place of the individual and egoistic family, a great universal family of workers will develop, in which all the workers, men and women, will above all be comrades. This is what relations between men and women, in the communist society will be like. These new relations will ensure for humanity all the joys of a love unknown in the commercial society of a love that is free and based on the true social equality of the partners.
Communist society wants bright healthy children and strong, happy young people, free in their feelings and affections. In the name of equality, liberty and the comradely love of the new marriage we call upon the working and peasant men and women, to apply themselves courageously and with faith to the work of rebuilding human society, in order to render it more perfect, more just and more capable of ensuring the individual the happiness which he or she deserves. The red flag of the social revolution which flies above Russia and is now being hoisted aloft in other countries of the world proclaim the approach of the heaven on earth to which humanity has been aspiring for centuries."

Ten Theses on Racial Capitalism
1. Racial capitalism is a way of understanding the role of racism in enabling key moments of capitalist development—it is not a way of understanding capitalism as a racist conspiracy or racism as a capital- ist conspiracy. To explain this point a little more: the analysis of the productivity of racialisation in the service of capitalism should not— must not—be read as an allegation of intentionality. There are racists in the world and some of them have profited through exploitation, but racial capitalism does not emerge as a result of a plan. No one maps out this programme and then enacts it. What we seek to understand is the place of racialisation in particular instances of capitalist formation, most of all when those instances are now.
2. To understand racial capitalism, we must revisit our understanding of the value of work and the conception of some activity as ‘non-work’.
This section of the discussion to follow borrows heavily from feminist debates about the conception of ‘work’ and an expanded conceptual- isation of social reproduction allows us to understand the racialised differentiation of populations as enabling forms of supplementarity beyond households.
3. Accounts of racial capitalism cannot act as metatheories of racism. Racism has a distinctive history that precedes capitalism.
4. Racial capitalism operates both through the exercise of coercive pow- er and through the mobilisation of desire. People are not only ‘forced’ to participate in economic arrangements that cast them to the social margins; they also rush to be included in this way and to become edge- subjects of capitalism. 5.

Introduction
Racial capitalism includes the sedimented histories of racialised dis- possession that shape economic life in our time, but is never reducible to those histories. There are new and unpredictable modes of dispos- session to be understood alongside the centuries-old carnage that moistens the earth beneath our feet.
Racial capitalism helps us to understand how people become divided from each other in the name of economic survival or in the name of economic well-being. One aspect of its techniques encompass the pro- cesses that appear to grant differential privileges to workers and al- most workers and non-workers and the social relations that flow from these differentiations.
Although the insights of scholars of intersectionality interweave with the discussion that follows, this is not an account of the intersectional- ity of capitalism. Neither is it an argument for the ‘primacy’ of race. Racial capitalism describes a set of techniques and a formation, and in both registers the disciplining and ordering of bodies through gender and sexuality and dis/ability and age flow through what is happening. I continue to call this ‘racial capitalism’ because these techniques of othering and exclusion utilise the logics of race, regardless of the targeted population.
The racial capitalism that I seek to describe here is intimately inter- twined with the processes precipitating ecological crisis. The myth of expendability—of expendable peoples and expendable regions— haunts our time and is a key motor of the forms of capitalist develop- ment that operate on the assumption that some populations will never be included and will never reach viability or sustainability.
The logics of racial capitalism suggest that capitalism cannot be ‘fixed’ or ‘adapted’ in a way that allows us all to be equal or all forms of humanity to be valued. This is not to say that change does not occur and that some historical disadvantages cannot be ameliorated. Howev-
er, it is to argue that capitalism cannot function if we all are allowed to become fully human. Dehumanisation seems to be an unavoidable outcome of the processes of capitalist development.

10. Racial capitalism is a way of understanding why we seem to be so divided and yet remain so intimately intertwined with each other. It is a description, not a manifesto. As always, what comes next is to be decided elsewhere.
Let us start at the very beginning, a very good place to start.
Of course, this is not a story about all human life. Who could imagine such a thing, let alone embark on its telling? Class struggle may be the story of all human history, but it is not a one-volume job. Strictly for the instalment market. The history of capitalism, on the other hand, that’s a much more bite-size endeavour. Not a tiny morsel but only a small-sigh chunk in the history of humanity. So, racial capitalism. That might be the story of all human life but only in this instant. A snapshot of what feels like the longue durée to us but which is in reality a mere blinking of an eye. The human suffering of genera- tions—all no more than one more ugly episode in the perpetual stand-off between those who have and those who do not.
Consider what follows not as a corrective (‘the true-life histories of the raciality of capitalism in all its gore-filled details’) but as a mystery (‘the strange tale of recurring racism’), perhaps with a nod to horror (‘blood and guts in accumulation’).
The main point to remember is: none of us really know whodunnit. If we did, the story would not be worth telling.
At the heart of this mystery is the question ‘why?’ Why such dehumanisa- tion, but only of some? Why such carnage? Why such devaluing of some lives? And alongside this over-arching instrumentalisation of human life, how are some deemed (even) less?
For us—of course, of course—there can be no retreat into fairy tales of human nature (so fallen, so evil). Not for us those tales of a racism that runs as deep as the secrets that make us human. The answers to the mystery of racial capitalism must lie in the mystery of capital itself. Or, at the very least, in shadows where capital meets other histories of dispossession."

"as an international political thoery expert, critically explain and analyse the main thesis in a discursive way following the author's main train if thought: National consciousness, Fanon says, is not “the coordinated crystallization of the people’s innermost aspirations.” Rather, it is “a crude, empty, fragile shell.” There are cracks in national consciousness, and it can quickly degrade from nation, to ethnic groups, to the state, and then to tribe. This deterioration, according to Fanon, is harmful to the developing nation. The problems with national consciousness can be overwhelmingly attributed to the national bourgeoisie. 
The national consciousness is not one stable, crystalized thing—it is pliable, impressionable, and rapidly building in a developing nation. The national consciousness must reflect the nation, not a single ethic group, state, or tribe. To degrade the national consciousness to any one of these things is to destroy it.

In a newly independent nation, the national bourgeoisie takes power after the exit of the colonial power, but the bourgeoisie is underdeveloped and inexperienced. The business elite and university graduates who make up the national bourgeoisie are small in number and concentrated in cities, but they are not industrialists, nor are they financiers. They don’t produce anything or invent anything, and they do very little actual work.  
In Fanon’s view, the national bourgeoisie does nothing productive for the nation, yet they are driving the politics and the economy. In developed nations, the bourgeoisie still drives society, but they are more experienced. The newly colonized, however, do not have this experience, and they quickly run the new nation into the ground.

The main job of the national bourgeoisie in an underdeveloped country is to reject their status as bourgeois and dedicate themselves to the peasant masses they represent. An authentic national bourgeoisie should leave their city vocation and go to the masses to learn from the people, and they should in turn teach the masses what they have learned in Western universities. This “heroic and positive path,” Fanon says, is the best way for the national bourgeoisie to remain helpful to the nation as a whole. 
Of course, the national bourgeoisie does not do this, because to do so would mean to abandon their cushy Westernized lives. In this way, Fanon implies that the national bourgeoisie are neither “heroic” nor “positive,” and are therefore a completely destructive part of society and serve no real, useful purpose.

As they are underdeveloped like their nation, the national bourgeoisie knows nothing about actual economics. Their knowledge is purely theoretical, and the economy they support is limited and based on local products. Under such economic plans, the national bourgeoisie make substantial profits while the people suffer. As the national bourgeoisie has limited skills, they are restricted in which colonial businesses they can take over after the exit of the colonial power. However, they take over every position they can, and they work capitalism and economics to their own best interest, creating a system of neocolonialism. At a psychological level, the national bourgeoisie identifies more with the Western bourgeoisie than with their own people. The national bourgeoisie mimics the Western bourgeoisie, sliding right into their place. However, nation building, Fanon says, is not about “taking short cuts.”
Here, Fanon implies that the national bourgeoisie’s attempt to slide into the colonial power’s place and run the nation in the exact same way is a “short cut.” Decolonizing is to dismantle the entire colonial situation, Fanon argues, not to keep what suits them and get rid of what doesn’t. Of course, since Fanon argues that nation building does involve keeping open Western channels of economics, this weakens his argument a bit. However, Fanon’s argument is clear: the power of the national bourgeoisie mimics that of the colonists, and thus, it is still colonialism and is not progress.

The national bourgeoisie, like the Western bourgeoisie, develops an economy based on tourism, including “exoticism, hunting, and casinos.” There are resorts and playgrounds, and soon tourism is a national industry. Casinos, like in Havana and Rio, saturate the landscape, and young Brazilian and Mexican girls are sold as well. 
Tourism is a huge trade in formerly colonized nations, and it, too, is another form of neocolonialism. Cities are still full of foreigners, and the indigenous are exploited in the process, as they are frequently placed in service positions to white people.

Landowners behave in much the same way as the national bourgeoisie. Soon after independence, the large farmers call for the nationalization of all agricultural holdings. They take over the farms that had been owned by the colonists, and they gain control over the region. The landowners exploit farm workers and are not interested in increasing their production or integrating into a national economy.
Ironically, the landowners want agriculture nationalized, meaning they want the nation to own and control it. Yet, they keep all the profits and do nothing for the nation, just like the national bourgeoisie. This, again, is more neocolonialism, only this time it is the landowners who are in control.

Soon after independence, the national bourgeoisie, having struggled against the racism of colonialism, call for the jobs of white lawyers, doctors, and landowners, claiming that such white workers insult the nation. They move to Africanize the managerial classes and demand all the jobs. The urban proletariat agrees with this nationalist viewpoint, but whereas the national bourgeoisie singles out white Europeans, the urban proletariat fights with other African nations. Race riots break out between indigenous tribes, and just like that, Fanon says, nationalism has changed to “ultranationalism, chauvinism, and racism.”
Ultranationalism holds importance of one tribe or state over another, which often brings out racist arguments, and this, too, is neocolonialism. In this way, whichever tribe or ethnic group holds the majority power, controls the nation, leaving all other tribes, races, and states behind. Again, Fanon argues that the nation and national consciousness must reflect the entire nation, not simply a portion of it.

Africanization and Arabization by the national bourgeoisie is not based in true nationalism. Rather, it is chiefly concerned with transferring power previously held by foreigners, which leads to “a depressing return to the most heinous and virulent type of chauvinism.” The national bourgeoisie, underdeveloped and inexperienced, is unable to enlighten the people or build the vision of the nation, and this leads to a return to tribalism and the rise of ethnic tensions. Colonialism, Fanon argues, does not exploit an entire nation. It focuses its efforts in urban areas and lets the peasant masses fall into complete poverty.  
The “depressing return to the most heinous and virulent type of chauvinism” is a reference to colonialism. As only one race—African or Arab—or one tribe within a single race is being represented here, this, too, turns to neocolonialism, and the nation is right back where they started. Fanon implies that the nation needs to be brought together by a single unifying force; however, the national bourgeoisie are not able to facilitate this coming together.

As conflict builds between ethnic groups, religious rivalries begin to surface as well, and the two major religions—Islam and Catholicism—begin to clash. Now, Fanon claims, colonialism is “back on its feet,” as it “shamelessly pulls all these strings” and keeps a nation divided and fighting. Africa, for instance, is divided into a white and black region. White Africa is considered rich in culture and civilization, while Black Africa is “wild, savage, [and] uncivilized.” This is much like the racism imposed by the colonist, and it is rooted in the same racist philosophy. 
Religion is a major way in which colonialism exerted its power around the globe. Christian missionaries were sent to Third World nations to civilize and bring God to the people they perceived as savages, and with the religious clash seen here, the very same thing is implied. Those who support religion, especially Catholicism, will automatically see the other nonreligious individuals as innately evil and uncivilized.

The inadequacies of the national bourgeoisie are not limited to only economics. They achieve power through biased nationalism and incite race wars to weaken and divide the people. According to Fanon, the national bourgeoisie preach human equality and freedom, but then they demand that others rise with them to the level of the West. Therefore, true African unity can only be accomplished through the people, and with complete disregard for the bourgeoisie. 
Fanon points out that the national bourgeoisie believes in equality, but they also believe that the West is superior to the East in every way, which is counterproductive to their claims. Disregarding this need to rise to the Western standard can only be accomplished, Fanon argues, if the national bourgeoisie are stripped of their power.

The national bourgeoisie is also inept in areas of domestic politics. They have no real power, so they believe the best approach is a single-party political system. This decision doesn’t inspire confidence in the people, and the State begins to oppress and harass the masses. The national bourgeoisie continues to ignore the peasant masses and focuses only on cities. They pander to foreign capitalists and do not share any profits with the people.
A single-party political system is essentially a dictatorship, which again places the new nation in a state of neocolonialism. One person, with the interests of the national bourgeoisie in mind, has absolute power over the nation. Under this model, the peasant masses are again oppressed and exploited.

Soon, a popular leader is selected to both steady the regime and placate the national bourgeoisie. This “bourgeois dictatorship” is fueled by the presence of a beloved leader, and as he makes his way across the nation speaking about the oppression of colonial power, the people immediately place their trust in him. He speaks of independence and freedom for all, but he is really just looking to “be the CEO” of the national bourgeoisie and their profits. The new leader combines the interests of the national bourgeoisie with the interests of ex-colonial companies, and he is a knowing accessory in the corruption of the national bourgeoisie.  
Again, the dictator has no interest in building the nation, only the national bourgeoisie, and the peasant masses are again made to suffer. This system also closely resembles the colonial system, and is therefore, by definition, not decolonization. In this way, Fanon implies that true decolonization cannot be achieved in any form as long as the national bourgeoisie are in power.

In the meantime, the former colonial power takes less trouble trying to hide the fact that they still have a hold over the national government. The new leader puts a divider between the people and the national bourgeoisie, and then he takes to supporting the bourgeoisie and hiding his efforts from the masses. Still, through his impassioned speeches, the people are fooled. Many nations have implemented such rulers, Fanon says. They usually come from the country, and they swear they speak for the black masses. The leader placates the people and refuses to break up the bourgeoisie, and each time he talks to the masses, he calls on them to remember colonial times and think about how far they have come. 
Fanon argues that it makes little difference if the colonial power is pulling the strings of oppression from abroad or from directly within the nation. In both scenarios, he implies, it is still colonialism, and it must be dismantled just like the practice of colonialism was for so many. Like the colonial power, the dictator manipulates the formerly colonized and banks on their history of struggle and war to drum up support. Furthermore, they haven’t actually come very far if they are still under a colonial system, Fanon implies.

Of course, Fanon says, the peasant masses aren’t able to assess how far they have come since colonialism. Their lives are much the same as they have always been—impoverished and hungry—and there has been little to no change. The police, who are now Africans, still harass them, and they are not particularly convinced that things are going that well for the nation. The rebellion, in the meantime, is losing patience. After becoming relatively immobile after independence, the rebellion is only needed for festivals and parades on Independence Day. The rebellion has done their part and helped the national bourgeoisie come to power, and now they are no longer needed.  
Those in the rebellion are completely used and thrown away when they are no longer needed, like many others under the colonial system. The rebellion was once crucial in the fight for independence, but now they man parades and festivals. Absolutely nothing has changed for the nation, except for who is in the role of oppressor, and the peasant masses are still being exploited. Again, Fanon implies that the national bourgeoisie is the enemy of the developing nation and must be removed if the nation is to progress.

Inside the new regime of the State, corruption abounds, and morals are nonexistent. The nationalist party helps to keep the State in power over the people and society is increasingly antidemocratic. The police hold everything together, and they are trained by foreign experts. The national bourgeoisie are trained by foreign experts as well, and they take concessions and kickbacks from foreign companies.
Again, this is a colonial system in place in even the absence of the colonial power. The State is run like a colony, and the police still have a tyrannical hold over the people. There is still no equality, and the national bourgeoisie are stealing from everyone, just like the colonialists.

Opposition to the nationalist party becomes more apparent, and hostility toward the national bourgeoisie grows, but this affects the national bourgeoisie very little. They are concerned only with Europe and will not invest time or money into their own nation. Dissent grows in the nation, and the army is dispatched to keep order, turning society even more authoritarian. The national bourgeoisie, Fanon says, “has learned nothing from history.” To move the nation forward, the masses “should bar the way to this useless and harmful bourgeoisie” that only serves to transform into a “caricature” of Europe.  
Here, Fanon clearly asserts the harmfulness of the bourgeoisie, who seem content to impose a new system of colonialism on their people. Fanon’s use of the word “caricature” to describe the new nation implies that not only is the nation not Europe, but it is some distorted image of Europe that is essentially a joke. By trying to adopt European ways, Fanon thus implies, the new nation is destined to fail.

From the beginning, the national bourgeoisie is concerned with intermediate activities. So, in order to lift the nation toward progress, the tertiary sector must be nationalized, which has been bombarded by the young national bourgeoisie. The tertiary sector is the most important by far under colonialism, and after independence, the civil servants sabotage the national economy and institutions, falling back on corruption and fraud. Buying and selling must be organized democratically in order to nationalize the tertiary sector, and all the people of a nation must be educated politically. This education should be given using plain language, and one that does not hide bourgeoisie leadership.
The tertiary sector, or the service sector of society, is important during colonialism because the colonized are in service to the colonists in a way that closely resembles slavery. By nationalizing the tertiary sector and turning control of it over to the nation—to the people—they, too, can profit from it. Of course, civil servants aren’t needed as much after the colonial power exits, which is why the sector has become corrupt in the postcolonial era. Understanding all these nuances, Fanon implies, is only possible with a political education.

The role of the political party in the developing nations is often a dictatorship used only to hold up the national bourgeoisie. The party is gradually transformed into an intelligence agency, and all opposition parties are rooted out, silenced, and banished. The nationalist party, which claims to work for the people, will send the people “back to their caves” as soon as the colonial power exits. Furthermore, this political party is damaging to national unity and works on a tribal basis. In many ways, it is a party made up of one ethnic group, which then claims to be national and speak the language of the people. This amounts to a “genuine ethnic dictatorship,” and instead of a bourgeoisie dictatorship, it is a tribal one. Jobs are given to those of the leader’s ethnic group, even members of his own family, and this quickly results in separatism and regionalist thinking.  
Fanon’s language that the people will be sent “back to their caves” again suggests that the people are animals or savages, and this, too, reflects the racist thinking of colonialism. The transformation of the political parties into an intelligence agency illustrates just how corrupt postcolonial society can be. Any party that might potentially upset the status quo is silenced, which suggests that the free and independent nation really isn’t so free. Once again, Fanon claims that for all the fighting, suffering, and struggling, the newly independent nation really hasn’t moved that far away from colonialism.

On the other hand, if a nation really wants to progress, they will need an honest party that is working for the people, not the government. The party should not be dedicated to politics, and they should not be centralized in the cities. All politicians should live in rural areas, and every effort should be made to decentralize the government. Doing so, Fanon says, is the only way to breathe life into struggling, and at times dying, regions.  
In completely dismantling the colonial situation, Fanon suggests changing everything, including the idea of a government capital in a metropolitan area. As most of the people don’t live in metropolitan areas, Fanon implies, neither should the nation’s political leaders.

Rural areas should be given absolute priority in the new nation. The importance of the capital is a myth, Fanon says, and every effort should be made to increase contact with peasant masses. National policies to that affect must be implemented, as one should never neglect those who fought for independence and improved life. It is not enough just to stay in contact with the peasant masses; rather, the political party should live in close proximity to them. In order to do all of this, however, the national bourgeoisie must be taken from power.
By definition, the national bourgeoisie will not relocate to the country, as their Westernized lifestyle cannot be supported there. But, Fanon argues, this is exactly the point. As the Third World is not a Western society, it cannot be structured in such a way. Fanon further implies that to effectively led the people, one must know the people, and that can only happen if one lives with the people.

The peasant masses are capable of governing themselves, Fanon argues, and they do understand the political issues at hand. While it may be common for an individual to misunderstand certain issues, the masses as a whole, easily understand. Of course, political education should include plain language that is not at all technical. People become more vigilant the more they understand, Fanon argues, and they understand that wealth is made from corruption, not their hard work. In an underdeveloped country, it is not important that some understand political implications and processes, it is imperative that everyone does, even if it takes twice as long to teach. The people must know what is going on, Fanon says, and the development of their national consciousness depends on it. 
Racist colonial assumptions dictate that the peasant masses are not smart enough to grasp these political concepts, but Fanon exposes how ridiculous this assumption is. Of course the people understand—they are simply given little to no credit by the Western-minded national bourgeoisie. As the national consciousness is the identity of the entire nation, one part of the country cannot be ignored to favor another. Fanon repeatedly advocates for a political education to be given to all members of a new and struggling nation, and he favors simple language that is free from jargon and bourgeoisie influence.

The young people of an underdeveloped nation must be addressed, too. Young people are often idle and illiterate, and they are vulnerable to all kinds of corruptive forces, such as alcohol and R-rated movies. Thus, the government should stabilize this population as well. Young people must be kept occupied, and instead of encouraging sports, school and work should be encouraged. The people should not be looking for a hero or leader. Instead, they should be looking to elevate the people.
Fanon rejects the idea of sports because they often offer up one member or player as the most important or the most heroic. Everyone is important in a developing nation, not just one person, and this egalitarian viewpoint should be fostered instead. Fanon earlier implies that young, vulnerable kids often turn into the lumpenproletariat, a trend that could also be remedied with education.

A political education does not mean a series of long speeches. To educate one politically is to open one’s mind and introduce it to the world, and it has nothing to do with speeches. Again, to make these approaches work, government must be decentralized and have the peasant masses on their side. The masses must be politicized, which will lead to making the nation a reality to everyone. If a government wants to declare itself national, then it must equally represent the entire nation.
Nation-building is a political process, Fanon implies, and the people must be educated accordingly. By educating the masses and relocating the government to the countryside to be near where the people actually live, Fanon argues that a new nation has a better chance of growing and prospering.

The peasant masses should be mobilized in a developing nation, and outdated traditions that favor women over men should not be given priority. The army must be nationalized as well, and the militia should be strengthened. Professional soldiers, too, are a bad idea, and career officers should be kept to a minimum. People should be placed in jobs and professions where they are needed, not put into the army to wait for a war to start. Nationalism is not political, and to foster the nation, national consciousness must take priority over social and political consciousness.
Building the nation should be first priority, Fanon claims, not building an army, which he implies is given far too much priority in Western societies. People are valuable to the nation in other ways, and those ways must be nurtured for the betterment of the nation. The nation is all about the people, and to Fanon, that is not a political idea.

In an underdeveloped country, the national effort must always involve the people. The national bourgeoisie will inevitably fail the people, and national politics most often lead to a “dead end.” The collective national consciousness is the “living expression of the nation,” and without it, there is chaos and oppression.
In short, Fanon claims that the way of the national bourgeoisie is a “dead end.” If the nation does not exist for the people, it is not truly a nation, which, again, only leads to neocolonialism and continued oppression.

"as  an international political thoery expert, critically explain and analyse the mian thesis in a discursive way following the author's main train if thought: WARS and revolutions- as though events had only hurried up to fulfil Lenin's early prediction - have thus far determined the physiognomy of the twentieth century. And as distinguished from the nineteenth-century ideologies - such as nationalism and internationalism, capitalism and imperialism, socialism and communism, which, though still invoked by many as justifying causes, have lost contact with the major realities of our world - war and revolution still constitute its two central political issues. They have outlived all their ideological justifications. In a con- stellation that poses the threat of total annihilation through war against the hope for the emancipation of all mankind through revolution -leading one people after the other in swift succession 'to assume among the powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitlethem' - no cause is left but the most ancient of all, the one, in fact, that from the beginning of our history has deter-. mined the very existence of politics, the cause of freedom versus tyranny.
This in itself is surprising enough. Under the concerted assault of the modern debunking 'sciences', psychology and sociology, nothing indeed has seemed to be more safely buried than the concept of freedom. Even the revolutionists, 'fhom one might have assumed ·to be safe]y and even inexorably anchored in a tradition that could hardly be told, let alone made sense of, with- out the notion of freedom, would much rather degrade freedom to the rank of a lower-middle-class prejudice than admit that the aim of revolution was, and always has been, freedom. Yet if it was amazing to see how the very word freedom could dis- appear from the revolutionary vocabulary, it has perhaps been no less astounding to watch how in recent years the idea of freedom has intruded itself into the centre of the gravest of all present political debates, the discussion of war and of a justifiable use of violence. Historically, wars are among the oldest pheno~ mena of the recorded past while revolutions, properly.speaking, did not exist prior to the modern age; they are among the most recent of all major political data. In contrast to revolution, the aim of war was only in rare cases bound up with the notion of freedom; and while it is true that warlike uprisings against a foreign invader have frequently been felt to be sacred, they· have never been recognized, either in theory or in practice, as the only just wars.
Justifications of wars, even on a theoretical level, are quite old, although, of course, not as old as organized warfare. Among their obvious prerequisites is the conviction that political relations in their normal course do not fall under the sway of violence, and this conviction we find for the first time in Greek antiquity, in so far as the Greek polis, the city-state, defined itself explicitly as a way of life that was based exclusively upon per.. suasion and not upon violence. (That these were no empty words, spoken in self-deception, is shown, among other things, by the Athenian custom of 'persuading' those who had been condemned to death to commit suicide by drinking the hemlock cup, thus sparing the Athenian citizen under all circumstances the indignity of physical violation.) However, since for the Greeks political life by definition did not extend beyond the walls of the polis, the use of violence seemed to them beyond the need for justification in the realm of what we today call foreign affairs or international relations, eventhough their foreign affairs, with the one exception of the Persian wars, which saw all Hellas united, concerned hardly more than relations between Greek cities. Outside the walls of the polis, that is, outside the realm of politics in the Greek sense of the word, 'the strong did what they
could, and the weak suffered what they must' (Thucydides). Hence we must turn to Roman antiquity to find the first justification of war, together with the first notion that there are just and unjust wars. Yet the Roman distinctions and justifica- tions were not concerned with freedom and drew no line between aggressive and defensive warfare. 'The war that is necessary is just,' said Livy, 'and hallowed are the arms where no hope exists but in them.' ('Iustum enim est bellum quibus neces- sarium, et pia arma ubi nulla nisi in armis spes est.') Necessity, since the time of Livy and through the centuries, has meant
-many things that we today would find quite sufficient to dub a war unjust rather than just. Conquest, expansion, defence of vested interests, conservation of power in view of the rise ofnew and threatening powers, or support of a given power equilibrium
- all these well-kown realities of power politics were not only actually the causes of the outbreak of most wars in history, they were also recognized as 'necessities', that is, as legitimate motives to invoke a decision by arms. The notion that aggression is a crime and that wars can be justified only if they ward off aggres- sion or prevent it acquired its practical and even theoretical significance only after the First World War had demonstrated the horribly destructive potential of warfare under conditions of modern technology.
Perhaps it is because of this noticeable absence of the freedom argument from the traditional justifications of war as the last resort of international politics that we have this curiously jarring sentiment whenever we hear it introduced into the debate of the war question today. To sound off with a cheerful 'give me liberty or give me death' sort of argument in the face of the unprece- dented and inconceivable potential of destruction in nuclear warfare is not even hollow; it is downright ridiculous. Indeed it seems so obvious that it is a very· different thing to risk one's own life for the life and freedom of one's country and one's posterity from risking the very existence of the human species for the same purpose that it is difficult not to suspect the defenders of the 'better dead than red' or 'better death than slavery' slogans of bad faith. Which of course is not to say the reverse, 'better red than dead', has any more to recommend itself; when an old truth ceases to be applicable, it does not become any truer by being stood on its head. As a matter of fact, to the extent that the discussion of the war ques~ion today is conducted in these terms, it is easy to detect a mental reservation on both sides.
Those who say 'better dead than red' actually think: The losses may not be as great as some anticipate, our civilization will survive; while those who say 'better red than dead' actually think: Slavery will not be so bad, man will not change his nature, freedom will not vanish from the earth forever. In other words, the bad faith of the discussants lies in that both dodge the preposterous alternative they themselves have proposed; they arc not serious.1
It is important to remember that the idea of freedom was introduced into the· debate of the war question after it had become quite obvious that we had reached a stage of technical development where the means of destruction were such as to ex· clude their rational use. In other words, freedom has appeared in this debate like a deus ex machina to jU:~tify what on rational grounds has become unjustifiable. Is it too much to read into the current rather hopeless confusion of issues and arguments a hopeful indication that a profound change in international rela- tions may be about to occur, namely, the disappearance of war from the scene of politics even without a radical transformation of international relations and without an inner change of men's hearts and minds? Could it not be that our present perplexity in this matter indicates our lack of preparedness for a disappearance of war, our inability to think in terms of foreign policy without having in mind this 'continuation with other means' as its last resort?
Quite apart from the threat of total annihilation, which con- ceivably could be eliminated by new technical discoveries such as a 'clean' bomb or an anti-missile missile, there are a few signs pointing in this direction. There is first the fact that the seeds of total war developed as early as the First World War, when the distinction between soldiers and civilians was no longer respected because it was inconsistent with the new weapons then used. To be sure, this distinction itself had been a relatively modern achievement, and its practical abolition meant no more than the reversion of warfare to the days when the Romans wiped Carthage off the face of the earth. Under modern circumstances, howev~r, this appearance or reappearance of total war has a very important political significance in so far as it contradicts the basic assumptions upon. which the relationship between the military and the civilian branches of government rests : it is the function of the army to protect and to defend the civilian population. In contrast, the history of warfare in our century could almost be told as the story of the growing incapacity of the army to fulfil this basic function, until today the strategy of deterrence has openly changed the role of the military from that of protector into that of a belated and essentially futile avenger.
Closely connected with this perversion in the relationship between state and army is second the little-noticed but quite noteworthy fact that since the end of the First World War we almost automatically expect that no government, and no state or form of government, will be strong enough to survive a defeat in war. This development could be traced back into the nine- teenth century when the Franco-Prussian War was followed by the change from the Second Empire to the Third Republic of France; and the Russian Revolution of 1905, following upon defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, certainly was an ominous sign of what lay in store for governments in case of a military defeat. However that may be, a revolutionary change in govern- ment, either brought about by the people themselves, as after the First World War, or enforced from the outside by the victorious powers with the demand of unconditional surrender and the establishment of .war trials, belongs today among the most cer- tain consequences of defeat in war - short, of course~ of total annihilation. In our context it is immaterial whether this state of affairs is due to a decisive weakening of government as such, to a loss of authority in the powers that be, or whether no state and no government, no matter how well established and trusted by its citizens, could withstand the unparalleled terror of violence unleashed by modern warfare upon the whole popu)ation. The truth is that even prior to the horror of nuclear warfare, wars had become politically, though not yet biologically, a matter of life and death. And this means that under conditions of modern warfare, that is since the First World War, all.governments have lived oh borrowed time.
The third fact seems to indicate a radical change in the very nature of war through the introduction of the deterrent as the guiding principle in the armament race. For it is indeed true that the strategy of deterrence 'aims in effect at avoiding rather than winning the war it pretends to be preparing. It tends to achieve its goal by a menace which is never put into execution, rather than by the act itself.'2 To be sure, the insight that peace is the end of war, and that therefore a war is the preparation for peace, is at least as old as Aristotle, and the pretence that the aim of an armament race is to safeguard the peace is even older, namely as old as the discovery of propaganda lies. But the point of the matter is that today the avoidance of war is not Qnly the true or pretended goal of an over-all policy but has become the guiding principle of the military preparations themselves. In other words, the military are no longer preparing for a war which the statesmen hope will never break out; their own goal has become to develop weapons that will make war impossible.
Moreover, it is quite in line with these, as it were, paradoxical efforts that a possible serious substitution of 'cold' wars for 'hot' . wars becomes clearly perceptible at the horizon of international politics. I do not wish to deny that the present and, let us hope, temporary resumption of atomiC tests by the big powers aims primarily at new technical developments and discoveries; but it seems to me undeniable that these tests, unlike those that pre- ceded them, are also instruments of policy, and as such they have the ominous aspect of a new kind of manoeuvre in peace- time, involving in their exercise not the make-believe pair of enemies of ordinary troop manoeuvres but the pair who, poten- tially at least, are the real enemies. It is as though the nuclear armament race has turned into some sort of tentative warfare in which the opponents demonstrate to each other the destructive- ness of the weapons in their possession; and while it is always possible that this deady game of ifs and whens may suddenly turn into the real thing, it is by no means inconceivable that one day victory and defeat may end a war that never exploded into reality.
Is this sheer fantasy? I think not. Potentially, at least, we were confronted with this kind of hypothetical warfare the very moment the atom bomb made its first appearance. Many people then thought, and still think, it would have been quite sufficient to demonstrate the new weapon to a select. group of Japanese scientists to force their government into unconditional surrender, for such a demonstration to those who knew would have con- stituted compelling evidence of an absolute superiority which no · changing luck or any other factor could hope to alter. Seventeen years after Hiroshima, our technical mastery of the means of destruction is fast approaching the point where all non-technical factors in warfare, such as troop morale, strategy, general com-
. petence, and even sheer chance, are completely eliminated so that results can be calculated with perfect precision in advance. Once this point is reached, the results of mere tests and demon- strations could be as conclusive evidence to the experts for victory or defeat as the battlefield, the conquest of territory, the break- down of communications, et cetera have formerly been to the military experts on either side.
There is finally, and in our context most importantly, the fact that the interrelationship of war and revolution, their recipro- cation and mutual dependence, has steadily grown, and that the emphasis in the relationship has shifted more and more from war to revolution. To be sure, the interrelatedness of wars and revolutions as such is not a novel phenomenon; it is as old as the revolutions themselves, which either were preceded and accom- panied by a war of liberation like the American Revolution, or led into wars of defence and aggression like the French Revolu- tion. But in our own century there has arisen, in addition to such
,instances, an altogeth~r different type of event in which it is as though even the fury of war was merely the prelude, a prepara- tory stage to the violence unleashed by revolution (such clearly was Pasternak's understanding of war and revolution in Russia in Doctor Zhivago), or where, on the contrary, a world war appears like the consequences of revolution, a kind of civil war raging all over the earth as even the Second World War was considered by a sizeable portion of public opinion and with con- siderable justification. Twenty years later, it has become almost a matter of course that the end of war is revolution, and that the only cause which possibly could justify it is the revolutionary cause of freedom. Hence, whatever the outcome of our present predicaments may be, if we don't perish altogether, it seems more than likely that revolution, in distinction to war, will stay with us into the foreseeable future. Even if we should succeed in changing the physiognomy of this century to the point where it would no longer be a century of wars, it most certainly will remain a century of revolutions. In the contest that divides the world today and in which so much is at. stake, those will prob- ably win who understand revolution, while those who still put their faith in power politics in the traditional sense of the term and, therefore, in war as the last resort of all foreign poliG:y may well discover in a not too distant future that they have become masters in a rather useless and obsolete trade. And such under- standing of revolution can be neither countered nor replaced with an expertness in counter~revolution; for counter~revolution - the word having been coined by Condorcet in the course of the French Revolution -has always remained bound to revolution as reaction is bound to action. De Maistre's famous statement: 'La contrerevolution ne sera point une revolution contraire, mais le contraire de la revolution' ('The counter~revolution will not be a revolution in reverse but the opposite of revolution') has remained ,.vhat it was when he pronounced it in 1796, an empty witticism.3
Yet, however needful it may be to distinguish in theory and practice between war and revolution despite their close interre- latedness, we must not fail to note that the mere fact that revolu- tions and wars are not even conceivable outside the domain of violence is enough to set them both apart from all other political phenomena. It would be difficult to deny that one of the reasons why wars have turned so easily into revolutions and why revolu- tions have shown this ominous inclination to unleash wars is that violence is a kind of common denominator for both. The magnitude of the violence let loose in the First World War might indeed have been enough to cause revolutions in its after- math even .without any revolutionary tra~ition and even if no revolution had ever occurred before.
To be sure, not even wars, let alone revolutions, are ever com- pletely determined by violence. \Vhere violence rules absolutely, as for instance in the concentration camps of totalitarian regimes; not only the laws - les lois se taisent, as the French Revolution phrased it - but everything and everybody must fall silent. It is because of this silence that violence is a marginal phenomenon in the political realm; for man, to the extent that he is a political being, is endowed with the power of speech. The two famous definitions of man by Aristotle, that he is a political being and a being endowed with speech, supplement each other and both refer to the same experience in Gr.eek polis life. The point here is that violence itself is incapable of speech, and not merely that speech is helpless when t.:onfronted with violence. Because of this sperchlessness political theory has little to say about the phenomenon of violence and must leave its discussion to the technicians. For political thought can only follow the articulations of the political phenomena themselves, it remains bound to what appears in the domain of human affairs; and these appearances, in contradistinction to physical matters, need speech and articulation, that is, 'Something which transcends mere physical visibility as well as sheer audibility, in order to be manifest at all. A theory of war or a theory of revolution, there- fore, can only deal with the justification of violence because this justification constitutes its political limitation; if, instead, it arrives at a glorification or justification of violence as such, it is no longer_political but antipolitical.
In so far as violence plays a predominant role in wars and revolutions, both occur outside the political realm, strictly speak- ing, in spite of their enormous role in recorded history. This fact led the seventeenth century, which had its share of experience in wars and revolutions, to the assumption of a prepolitical state, called 'state of nature' which, ,of course, never was meant to be taken as a historical fact. Its relevance even today lies in 'the recognition that a political realm does not automatically come into being wherever men live together, and tha~ there exist events which, though they may occur in a strictly historical context, are not really political and perhaps not even connected with politics. The notion of a state of nature alludes at least to a reality that cannot be comprehended by the nineteenth-century idea of development, no matter how we may conceive of it - whether in the form of cause and effect, or of potentiality and actuality, or of a dialectical movement, or even of simple coherence and sequence in occurrences. For the hypothesis of a state of nature implies the existence of a beginning that is separated from every- thing following it as though by an unbridgeable chasm.
The relevance of the problem of beginning to the phenomenon of revolution is obvious. That such a beginning must be inti- mately connected with violence seems to be vouched for by the legendary beginnings of our history as both biblical and classical antiquity report it: Cain slew Abel, and Romulus slew Remus; violence was the beginning and, by the same token, no begin~ ning could be made without using violence, without violating. The first recorded deeds in our biblical and our secular tradition, whether known to be legendary or believed in as historical fact, have travelled through the centuries with the force which human thought achieves in the rare instances when it produces cogent metaphors or universally applicable tales. The tale spoke clearly: whatever brotherhood human beings may be capable of has gro""Y~_?l!_t_~!_!!-atri~ide, whatever eolitical o~ganization men may liave ac!lieved .has its origin in crime. The conviction, in the beginning-was-a'crime-=-for which the phrase 'state of nature' is only a theoretically purified paraphrase- has carried through the centuries no less self-evident plausibility for the state of human affairs than the first sentenc.e of St John, 'In the begin- ning was the Word', has possessed for the affairs of salvation."

"as a democraccy & democratisation  expert, explain in a discursive way following the author's main train :"
"as a democraccy & democratisation  expert, explain in a discursive way following the author's main train : The distant origins of the present volume lie in an article entitled ""The End of History?"" which I wrote for the journal The National Interest in the summer of 1989.1 In it, I argued that a remarkable consensus concerning the legitimacy of liberal democracy as a system of government had emerged throughout the world over the past few years, as it conquered rival ideologies like hereditary monarchy, fascism, and most recently communism. More than that, however, I argued that liberal democracy may constitute the ""end point of mankind's ideological evolution"" and the ""final form of human government,"" and as such constituted the ""end of his­ tory."" That is, while earlier forms of government were character­ ized by grave defects and irrationalities that led to their eventual collapse, liberal democracy was arguably free from such funda­ mental internal contradictions. This was not to say that today's stable democracies, like the United States, France, or Switzerland, were not without injustice or serious social problems. But these problems were ones of incomplete implementation of the twin principles of liberty and equality on which modern democracy is founded, rather than of flaws in the principles themselves. While some present-day countries might fail to achieve stable liberal democracy, and others might lapse back into other, more primi­ tive forms of rule like theocracy or military dictatorship, the ideal of liberal democracy could not be improved on.
The original article excited an extraordinary amount of com­ mentary and controversy, first in the United States, and then in a series of countries as different as England, France, Italy, the So­ viet Union, Brazil, South Africa, Japan, and South Korea. Criti­ cism took every conceivable form, some of it based on simple misunderstanding of my original intent, and others penetrating more perceptively to the core of my argument.2 Many people were confused in the first instance by my use of the word ""his­ tory."" Understanding history in a conventional sense as the oc­ currence of events, people pointed to the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Chinese communist crackdown in Tiananmen Square, and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait as evidence that ""history was con­ tinuing,"" and that I was ipsofacto proven wrong.
And yet what I suggested had come to an end was not the occurrence of events, even large and grave events, but History: that is, history understood as a single, coherent, evolutionary pro­ cess, when taking into account the experience of all peoples in all times. This understanding of History was most closely associated with the great German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel. It was made part of our daily intellectual atmosphere by Karl Marx, who bor­ rowed this concept of History from Hegel, and is implicit in our use of words like ""primitive"" or ""advanced,"" ""traditional"" or ""modern,"" when referring to different types of human societies. For both of these thinkers, there was a coherent development of human societies from simple tribal ones based on slavery and subsistence agriculture, through various theocracies, monarchies, and feudal aristocracies, up through modern liberal democracy and technologically driven capitalism. This evolutionary process was neither random nor unintelligible, even if it did not proceed in a straight line, and even if it was possible to question whether man was happier or better off as a result of historical ""progress.""
Both Hegel and Marx believed that the evolution of human societies was not open-ended, but would end when mankind had achieved a form of society that satisfied its deepest and most fun­ damental longings. Both thinkers thus posited an ""end of his­ tory"": for Hegel this was the liberal state, while for Marx it was a communist society. This did not mean that the natural cycle of birth, life, and death would end, that important events would no longer happen, or that newspapers reporting them would cease to be published. It meant, rather, that there would be no further progress in the development of underlying principles and insti­ tutions, because all of the really big questions had been settled.
The present book is not a restatement of my original article, nor is it an effort to continue the discussion with that article's many critics and commentators. Least of all is it an account of the end of the Cold War, or any other pressing topic in contemporary politics. While this book is informed by recent world events, its subject returns to a very old question: Whether, at the end of the twentieth century, it makes sense for us once again to speak of a coherent and directional History of mankind that will eventually lead the greater part of humanity to liberal democracy? The an-  swer I arrive at is yes, for two separate reasons. One has to do with economics, and the other has to do with what is termed the ""strug­ gle for recognition.""
It is of course not sufficient to appeal to the authority of He­ gel, Marx, or any of their contemporary followers to establish the validity of a directional History. In the century and a half since they wrote, their intellectual legacy has been relentlessly assaulted from all directions. The most profound thinkers of the twentieth century have directly attacked the idea that history is a coherent or intelligible process; indeed, they have denied the possibility that any aspect of human life is philosophically intelligible. We in the West have become thoroughly pessimistic with regard to the possibility of overall progress in democratic institutions. This pro­ found pessimism is not accidental, but born of the truly terrible political events of the first half of the twentieth century—two destructive world wars, the rise of totalitarian ideologies, and the turning of science against man in the form of nuclear weapons and environmental damage. The life experiences of the victims of this past century's political violence—from the survivors of Hit- lerism and Stalinism to the victims of Pol Pot—would deny that there has been such a thing as historical progress. Indeed, we have become so accustomed by now to expect that the future will contain bad news with respect to the health and security of decent, liberal, democratic political practices that we have problems rec­ ognizing good news when it comes.
And yet, good news has come. The most remarkable develop­ ment of the last quarter of the twentieth century has been the revelation of enormous weaknesses at the core of the world's seemingly strong dictatorships, whether they be of the military- authoritarian Right, or the communist-totalitarian Left. From Latin America to Eastern Europe, from the Soviet Union to the Middle East and Asia, strong governments have been failing over the last two decades. And while they have not given way in all cases to stable liberal democracies, liberal democracy remains the only coherent political aspiration that spans different regions and cultures around the globe. In addition, liberal principles in economics—the ""free market""—have spread, and have succeeded in producing unprecedented levels of material prosperity, both in industrially developed countries and in countries that had been, at the close of World War II, part of the impoverished Third World. A liberal revolution in economic thinking has sometimes preceded, sometimes followed, the move toward political freedom around the globe.
All of these developments, so much at odds with the terrible history of the first half of the century when totalitarian govern­ ments of the Right and Left were on the march, suggest the need to look again at the question of whether there is some deeper connecting thread underlying them, or whether they are merely accidental instances of good luck. By raising once again the ques­ tion of whether there is such a thing as a Universal History of mankind, I am resuming a discussion that was begun in the early nineteenth century, but more or less abandoned in our time be­ cause of the enormity of events that mankind has experienced since then. While drawing on the ideas of philosophers like Kant and Hegel who have addressed this question before, I hope that the arguments presented here will stand on their own.
This volume immodestly presents not one but two separate efforts to outline such a Universal History. After establishing in Part I why we need to raise once again the possibility of Univer­ sal History, I propose an initial answer in Part II by attempting to use modern natural science as a regulator or mechanism to explain the directionality and coherence of History. Modern natural sci­ ence is a useful starting point because it is the only important social activity that by common consensus is both cumulative and direc­ tional, even if its ultimate impact on human happiness is ambigu­ ous. The progressive conquest of nature made possible with the development of the scientific method in the sixteenth and seven­ teenth centuries has proceeded according to certain definite rules laid down not by man, but by nature and nature's laws.
The unfolding of modern natural science has had a uniform effect on all societies that have experienced it, for two reasons. In the first place, technology confers decisive military advantages on those countries that possess it, and given the continuing possibility of war in the international system of states, no state that values its independence can ignore the need for defensive modernization. Second, modern natural science establishes a uniform horizon of economic production possibilities. Technology makes possible the limitless accumulation of wealth, and thus the satisfaction of an ever-expanding set of human desires. This process guarantees an increasing homogenizatioq of all human societies, regardless of their historical origins or cultural inheritances. All countries un­ dergoing economic modernization must increasingly resemble one another: they must unify nationally on the basis of a central­ ized state, urbanize, replace traditional forms of social organiza­ tion like tribe, sect, and family with economically rational ones based on function and efficiency, and provide for the universal education of their citizens. Such societies have become increas­ ingly linked with one another through global markets and the spread of a universal consumer culture. Moreover, the logic of modern natural science would seem to dictate a universal evolu­ tion in the direction of capitalism. The experiences of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries indicate that while highly centralized economies are sufficient to reach the level of industrialization represented by Europe in the 1950s, they are woefully inadequate in creating what have been termed complex ""post-industrial"" economies in which information and technolog­ ical innovation play a much larger role.
But while the historical mechanism represented by modern natural science is sufficient to explain a great deal about the char­ acter of historical change and the growing uniformity of modern societies, it is not sufficient to account for the phenomenon of democracy. There is no question but that the world's most devel­ oped countries are also its most successful democracies. But while modern natural science guides us to the gates of the Promised Land of liberal democracy, it does not deliver us to the Promised Land itself, for there is no economically necessary reason why advanced industrialization should produce political liberty. Stable democracy has at times emerged in pre-industrial societies, as it did in the United States in 1776. On the other hand, there are many historical and contemporary examples of technologically advanced capitalism coexisting with political authoritarianism, from Meiji Japan and Bismarckian Germany to present-day Sin­ gapore and Thailand. In many cases, authoritarian states are ca­ pable of producing rates of economic growth unachievable in democratic societies.
Our first effort to establish the basis for a directional history is thus only partly successful. What we have called the ""logic of modern natural science"" is in effect an economic interpretation of historical change, but one which (unlike its Marxist variant) leads to capitalism rather than socialism as its final result. The logic of modern science can explain a great deal about our world: why we residents of developed democracies are office workers rather than peasants eking out a living on the land, why we are members of labor unions or professional organizations rather than tribes or clans, why we obey the authority of a bureaucratic superior rather than a priest, why we are literate and speak a common national language.
But economic interpretations of history are incomplete and unsatisfying, because man is not simply an economic animal. In particular, such interpretations cannot really explain why we are democrats, that is, proponents of the principle of popular sover­ eignty and the guarantee of basic rights under a rule of law. It is for this reason that the book turns to a second, parallel account of the historical process in Part III, an account that seeks to recover the whole of man and notjust his economic side. To do this, we return to Hegel and Hegel's non-materialist account of History, based on the ""struggle for recognition.""
According to Hegel, human beings like animals have natural needs and desires for objects outside themselves such as food, drink, shelter, and above all the preservation of their own bodies. Man differs fundamentally from the animals, however, because in addition he desires the desire of other men, that is, he wants to be ""recognized."" In particular, he wants to be recognized as a human being, that is, as a being with a certain worth or dignity. This worth in the first instance is related to his willingness to risk his life in a struggle over pure prestige. For only man is able to overcome his most basic animal instincts—chief among them his instinct for self-preservation—for the sake of higher, abstract principles and goals. According to Hegel, the desire for recognition initially drives two primordial combatants to seek to make the other ""rec­ ognize"" their humanness by staking their lives in a mortal battle. When the natural fear of death leads one combatant to submit, the relationship of master and slave is born. The stakes in this bloody battle at the beginning of history are not food, shelter, or security, but pure prestige. And precisely because the goal of the battle is not determined by biology, Hegel sees in it the first glim­ mer of human freedom.
The desire for recognition may at first appear to be an unfa­ miliar concept, but it is as old as the tradition of Western political philosophy, and constitutes a thoroughly familiar part of the hu­ man personality. It was first described by Plato in the Republic, when he noted that there were three parts to the soul, a desiring part, a reasoning part, and a part that he called thymos, or ""spir- itedness."" Much of human behavior can be explained as a com- bination of the first two parts, desire and reason: desire induces men to seek things outside themselves, while reason or calculation shows them the best way to get them. But in addition, human beings seek recognition of their own worth, or of the people, things, or principles that they invest with worth. T h e propensity to invest the self with a certain value, and to demand recognition for that value, is what in today's popular language we would call ""self-esteem."" The propensity to feel self-esteem arises out of the part of the soul called thymos. It is like an innate human sense of
justice. People believe that they have a certain worth, and when other people treat them as though they are worth less than that, they experience the emotion of anger. Conversely, when people fail to live up to their own sense of worth, they feel shame, and when they are evaluated correctly in proportion to their worth, they feel pride. The desire for recognition, and the accompanying emotions of anger, shame, and pride, are parts of the human personality critical to political life. According to Hegel, they are what drives the whole historical process.
By Hegel's account, the desire to be recognized as a human being with dignity drove man at the beginning of history into a bloody battle to the death for prestige. The outcome of this battle was a division of human society into a class of masters, who were willing to risk their lives, and a class of slaves, who gave in to their natural fear of death. But the relationship of lordship and bond­ age, which took a wide variety of forms in all of the unequal, aristocratic societies that have characterized the greater part of human history, failed ultimately to satisfy the desire for recogni­ tion of either the masters or the slaves. The slave, of course, was not acknowledged as a human being in any way whatsoever. But the recognition enjoyed by the master was deficient as well, be­ cause he was not recognized by other masters, but slaves whose humanity was as yet incomplete. Dissatisfaction with the flawed recognition available in aristocratic societies constituted a ""contra­ diction"" that engendered further stages of history.
Hegel believed that the ""contradiction"" inherent in the rela­ tionship of lordship and bondage was finally overcome as a result of the French and, one would have to add, American revolutions. These democratic revolutions abolished the distinction between master and slave by making the former slaves their own masters and by establishing the principles of popular sovereignty and the rule of law. The inherently unequal recognition of masters and slaves is replaced by universal and reciprocal recognition, where every citizen recognizes the dignity and humanity of every other citizen, and where that dignity is recognized in turn by the state through the granting of rights.
This Hegelian understanding of the meaning of contempo­ rary liberal democracy differs in a significant way from the Anglo- Saxon understanding that was the theoretical basis of liberalism in countries like Britain and the United States. In that tradition, the prideful quest for recognition was to be subordinated to enlight­ ened self-interest—desire combined with reason—and particu­ larly the desire for self-preservation of the body. While Hobbes, Locke, and the American Founding Fathers like Jefferson and Madison believed that rights to a large extent existed as a means of preserving a private sphere where men can enrich themselves and satisfy the desiring parts of their souls,3 Hegel saw rights as ends in themselves, because what truly satisfies human beings is not so much material prosperity as recognition of their status and dignity. With the American and French revolutions, Hegel as­ serted that history comes to an end because the longing that had driven the historical process—the struggle for recognition—has now been satisfied in a society characterized by universal and reciprocal recognition. No other arrangement of human social institutions is better able to satisfy this longing, and hence no further progressive historical change is possible.
The desire for recognition, then, can provide the missing link between liberal economics and liberal politics that was missing from the economic account of History in Part II. Desire and rea­ son are together sufficient to explain the process of industrializa­ tion, and a large part of economic life more generally. But they cannot explain the striving for liberal democracy, which ultimately arises out of thymos, the part of the soul that demands recognition. The social changes that accompany advanced industrialization, in particular universal education, appear to liberate a certain de­ mand for recognition that did not exist among poorer and less educated people. As standards of living increase, as populations become more cosmopolitan and better educated, and as society as a whole achieves a greater equality of condition, people begin to demand not simply more wealth but recognition of their status. If people were nothing more than desire and reason, they would be content to live in market-oriented authoritarian states like Fran­ co's Spain, or a South Korea or Brazil under military rule. But they also have a thymotic pride in their own self-worth, and this leads them to demand democratic governments that treat them like adults rather than children, recognizing their autonomy as free individuals. Communism is being superseded by liberal de­ mocracy in our time because of the realization that the former provides a gravely defective form of recognition.
An understanding of the importance of the desire for recog­ nition as the motor of history allows us to reinterpret many phe­ nomena that are otherwise seemingly familiar to us, such as culture, religion, work, nationalism, and war. Part IV is an attempt to do precisely this, and to project into the future some of the dif­ ferent ways that the desire for recognition will be manifest. A re­ ligious believer, for example, seeks recognition for his particular gods or sacred practices, while a nationalist demands recognition for his particular linguistic, cultural, or ethnic group. Both of these forms of recognition are less rational than the universal recogni­ tion of the liberal state, because they are based on arbitrary dis­ tinctions between sacred and profane, or between human social groups. For this reason, religion, nationalism, and a people's com­ plex of ethical habits and customs (more broadly ""culture"") have traditionally been interpreted as obstacles to the establishment of successful democratic political institutions and free-market econ­ omies.
But the truth is considerably more complicated, for the suc­ cess of liberal politics and liberal economics frequently rests on irrational forms of recognition that liberalism was supposed to overcome. For democracy to work, citizens need to develop an irrational pride in their own democratic institutions, and must also develop what Tocqueville called the ""art of associating,"" which rests on prideful attachment to small communities. These communities are frequently based on religion, ethnicity, or other forms of recognition that fall short of the universal recognition on which the liberal state is based. The same is true for liberal economics. Labor has traditionally been understood in the West­ ern liberal economic tradition as an essentially unpleasant activ­ ity undertaken for the sake of the satisfaction of human desires and the relief of human pain. But in certain cultures with a strong work ethic, such as that of the Protestant entrepreneurs who created European capitalism, or of the elites who modern­ ized Japan after the Meiji restoration, work was also undertaken for the sake of recognition. To this day, the work ethic in many Asian countries is sustained not so much by material incentives, as by the recognition provided for work by overlapping social groups, from the family to the nation, on which these societies are based. This suggests that liberal economics succeeds not sim­ ply on the basis of liberal principles, but requires irrational forms of thymos as well.
The struggle for recognition provides us with insight into the nature of international politics. The desire for recognition that led to the original bloody battle for prestige between two individ­ ual combatants leads logically to imperialism and world empire. The relationship of lordship and bondage on a domestic level is naturally replicated on the level of states, where nations as a whole seek recognition and enter into bloody battles for supremacy. Nationalism, a modern yet not-fully-rational form of recognition, has been the vehicle for the struggle for recognition over the past hundred years, and the source of this century's most intense con­ flicts. This is the world of ""power politics,"" described by such foreign policy ""realists"" as Henry Kissinger.
But if war is fundamentally driven by the desire for recogni­ tion, it stands to reason that the liberal revolution which abolishes the relationship of lordship and bondage by making former slaves their own masters should have a similar effect on the relationship between states. Liberal democracy replaces the irrational desire to be recognized as greater than others with a rational desire to be recognized as equal. A world made up of liberal democracies, then, should have much less incentive for war, since all nations would reciprocally recognize one another's legitimacy. And in­ deed, there is substantial empirical evidence from the past couple of hundred years that liberal democracies do not behave imperi- alistically toward one another, even if they are perfectly capable of going to war with states that are not democracies and do not share their fundamental values. Nationalism is currently on the rise in regions like Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union where peoples have long been denied their national identities, and yet within the world's oldest and most secure nationalities, nationalism is under­ going a process of change. The demand for national recognition in Western Europe has been domesticated and made compatible with universal recognition, much like religion three or four cen­ turies before.
The fifth and final part of this book addresses the question of the ""end of history,"" and the creature who emerges at the end, the  
""last man."" In the course of the original debate over the National Interest article, many people assumed that the possibility of the end of history revolved around the question of whether there were viable alternatives to liberal democracy visible in the world today. There was a great deal of controversy over such questions as whether communism was truly dead, whether religion or ul- tranationalism might make a comeback, and the like. But the deeper and more profound question concerns the goodness of lib- eral democracy itself, and not only whether it will succeed against its present-day rivals. Assuming that liberal democracy is, for the moment, safe from external enemies, could we assume that suc- cessful democratic societies could remain that way indefinitely? Or is liberal democracy prey to serious internal contradictions, con- tradictions so serious that they will eventually undermine it as a political system? There is no doubt that contemporary democracies face any number of serious problems, from drugs, homelessness, and crime to environmental damage and the frivolity of consum- erism. But these problems are not obviously insoluble on the basis of liberal principles, nor so serious that they would necessarily lead to the collapse of society as a whole, as communism collapsed in the
1980s.
Writing in the twentieth century, Hegel's great interpreter, Alexandre Kojève, asserted intransigently that history had ended because what he called the ""universal and homogeneous state""— what we can understand as liberal democracy—definitely solved the question of recognition by replacing the relationship of lord- ship and bondage with universal and equal recognition. What man had been seeking throughout the course of history—what had driven the prior ""stages of history""—was recognition. In the modern world, he finally found it, and was ""completely satisfied."" This claim was made seriously by Kojève, and it deserves to be taken seriously by us. For it is possible to understand the problem of politics over the millennia of human history as the effort to solve the problem of recognition. Recognition is the central prob- lem of politics because it is the origin of tyranny, imperialism, and the desire to dominate. But while it has a dark side, it cannot simply be abolished from political life, because it is simultaneously the psychological ground for political virtues like courage, public- spiritedness, and justice. All political communities must make use of the desire for recognition, while at the same time protecting themselves from its destructive effects. If contemporary constitu-tional government has indeed found a formula whereby all are recognized in a way that nonetheless avoids the emergence of tyranny, then it would indeed have a special claim to stability and longevity among the regimes that have emerged on earth.
But is the recognition available to citizens of contemporary liberal democracies ""completely satisfying?"" T h e long-term future of liberal democracy, and the alternatives to it that may one day arise, depend above all on the answer to this question. In Part V we sketch two broad responses, from the Left and the Right, respectively. The Left would say that universal recognition in lib­ eral democracy is necessarily incomplete because capitalism cre­ ates economic inequality and requires a division of labor that ipso
facto implies unequal recognition. In this respect, a nation's abso­ lute level of prosperity provides no solution, because there will continue to be those who are relatively poor and therefore invis­ ible as human beings to their fellow citizens. Liberal democracy, in other words, continues to recognize equal people unequally.
The second, and in my view more powerful, criticism of uni­ versal recognition comes from the Right that was profoundly concerned with the leveling effects of the French Revolution's commitment to human equality. This Right found its most bril­ liant spokesman in the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, whose views were in some respects anticipated by that great observer of democratic societies, Alexis de Tocqueville. Nietzsche believed that modern democracy represented not the self-mastery of former slaves, but the unconditional victory of the slave and a kind of slavish morality. The typical citizen of a liberal democracy was a ""last man"" who, schooled by the founders of modern liber­ alism, gave up prideful belief in his or her own superior worth in favor of comfortable self-preservation. Liberal democracy pro­ duced ""men without chests,"" composed of desire and reason but lacking thymos, clever at finding new ways to satisfy a host of petty wants through the calculation of long-term self-interest. The last man had no desire to be recognized as greater than others, and without such desire no excellence or achievement was possible. Content with his happiness and unable to feel any sense of shame for being unable to rise above those wants, the last man ceased to be human.
Following Nietzsche's line of thought, we are compelled to ask the following questions: Is not the man who is completely satisfied by nothing more than universal and equal recognition something less than a full human being, indeed, an object of contempt, a ""last man"" with neither striving nor aspiration? Is there not a side of the human personality that deliberately seeks out struggle, dan­ ger, risk, and daring, and will this side not remain unfulfilled by the ""peace and prosperity"" of contemporary liberal democracy? Does not the satisfaction of certain human beings depend on rec­ ognition that is inherently unequal? Indeed, does not the desire for unequal recognition constitute the basis of a livable life, not
just for bygone aristocratic societies, but also in modern liberal democracies? Will not their future survival depend, to some ex­ tent, on the degree to which their citizens seek to be recognized not just as equal, but as superior to others? And might not the fear of becoming contemptible ""last men"" not lead men to assert them­ selves in new and unforeseen ways, even to the point of becoming once again bestial ""first men"" engaged in bloody prestige battles, this time with modern weapons?
This books seeks to address these questions. They arise natu­ rally once we ask whether there is such a thing as progress, and whether we can construct a coherent and directional Universal History of mankind. Totalitarianisms of the Right and Left have kept us too busy to consider the latter question seriously for the better part of this century. But the fading of these totalitarian­ isms, as the century comes to an end, invites us to raise this old question one more time."

"can you improve this essay structure answering this question:  Assess the relevance of Césaire and Fanon for contemporary international political theory.


I. Introduction
•
Begin with a broad statement about the enduring impact of colonialism on international relations and the importance of postcolonial perspectives.
•
Introduce Aimé Césaire and Frantz Fanon as key theorists of colonialism and anti-colonialism, noting their foundational role in postcolonial thought and International Relations theory.
•
State the essay's argument: that the works of Césaire and Fanon remain highly relevant for contemporary international political theory due to their incisive critiques of colonialism and their exploration of related issues.
•
Briefly outline the main themes to be discussed: critique of colonialism, relevance to postcolonial IR, the relationship between colonialism and fascism, the role of violence, and the importance of culture and identity in decolonization.
II. Critique of Colonialism
•
Discuss Césaire's critique of the ideology of racial and cultural hierarchy central to colonial rule in Discourse on Colonialism.
•
Explain how Fanon, in The Wretched of the Earth, exposes the dehumanizing effects of colonialism and highlights the economic exploitation inherent in the system.
•
Analyze how their critiques challenge the benevolent narratives of empire, demonstrating the realities of racial subjugation, exploitation, and expropriation.
•
Connect their insights to contemporary global inequalities and power structures, emphasizing how the historical roots of colonialism continue to shape the present.
III. Relevance to Postcolonial International Relations
•
Explain how postcolonial theory draws inspiration from thinkers such as Césaire and Fanon.
•
Discuss how postcolonial scholars argue that the political, social, and racial hierarchies imposed by European colonial powers persist in international politics, even after the formal end of decolonization.
•
Discuss how Césaire’s work shows that the colonial system was not just an economic system but that it impacted the culture and identity of both the colonizer and the colonized.
•
Refer to how Fanon's analysis of the psychological impact of colonialism remains relevant in understanding the lived experiences of people affected by racism and systemic oppression.
•
Demonstrate how this theoretical framework is crucial for understanding contemporary issues like neocolonialism, where former colonies may still be subject to external influence.
IV. The Relationship Between Colonialism and Fascism
•
Explore Césaire's analysis of the links between colonialism and fascism, demonstrating that the violence and dehumanization characteristic of colonialism also informed the rise of fascism in Europe.
•
Introduce the idea of the ""boomerang effect,"" where colonial techniques of control and repression are brought back to the colonizer's homeland.
•
Relate this to contemporary forms of state violence and the militarization of policing, which find their roots in colonial practices.
V. Violence and Decolonization
•
Examine Fanon's argument for the use of violence in anticolonial struggles, as presented in The Wretched of the Earth.
•
Explain that, for Fanon, violence was a direct response to the violence inherent in colonialism and a necessary tool for liberation.
•
Discuss how Fanon's ideas continue to spark debate in discussions of revolution, resistance, and liberation movements, noting the ethical complexities involved.
•
Acknowledge that the role of violence is a point of contention in political theory.
VI. Culture, Identity, and Decolonization
•
Discuss Césaire's and Fanon’s engagement with the role of culture in the struggle for decolonization.
•
Explain that both theorists acknowledged the importance of cultural reclamation in challenging colonial oppression.
•
Analyze how Fanon also cautioned against the pitfalls of nationalism in the post-independence era.
•
Discuss how the concept of Negritude arose as a way for colonized peoples to define themselves, noting that Césaire felt that everyone has their own Negritude.
•
Connect these ideas to the ongoing struggles for cultural identity and self-determination in the postcolonial world."

"based only on the info you can fin din these texts, can help me expand this paragraph on the potentials of this idea of 'cross-cutting cleavages' in the context of contemporary forms of polarisation: Cross-cutting cleavages as a stabilising force
In 'Some Social Requisites of Democracy'  Lipset (1959) argues that democratic stability is strengthened when individuals hold multiple, overlapping group affiliations, as they prevent the consolidation of all social divisions into a singular political conflict, thereby reducing polarization.
On the sociological dimension, Lipset (1959) argues that individuals that belong to multiple, sometimes conflicting, identity groups, tend to develop a form of political moderation, acting as bridges between competing factions and reducing the likelihood of deep societal divisions (Lipset, 1960; Lipset and Rokkan, 1967). Similarly, Coser (1956) and Dahrendorf (1959) argued that outright social conflict is less severe when cleavages cut across one another, rather than aligning in a way that hardens political antagonisms, fostering dialogue rather than entrenchment (Gordon et al, 2015). From a political-institutional perspective, Truman (1951) and Dahl (1956) argue that crosscutting cleavages increase the likelihood of coalition-building, thus integrating marginalized groups into the political process, and reduce the likelihood of extreme political behavior. Taylor and Rae (1969) quantitatively measured the effects of cross-cutting cleavages through the concept of cross-cutting index (XC), which evaluates the degree to which different social cleavages overlap within a society. Their findings indicate that societies with high levels of cross-cutting cleavages tend to exhibit greater political stability, whereas those with rigid, reinforcing cleavages are more prone to polarization and conflict. Indeed, if a society is too homogeneous—or too heterogeneous—across racial, linguistic, or religious cleavages, democratic stability is unlikely. Moreover, Selway’s (2011) empirical studies have supported this claim, showing that societies with high cross-cutting cleavages tend to experience higher economic growth and greater political stability, in contrast to those where ethnic, religious, and economic divisions are deeply intertwined, making them more vulnerable to democratic erosion. In the context of contemporary forms of polarization, the cross-cutting theory model continues to illustrate patterns of political competition and democratic stability in Western Europe. As highlighted by Selway (2011) and McCoy et al. (2018), modern societies are more multidimensional than ever. The cleavage model, which historically identified individuals along a Left–Right ideological scale based on their affiliation with social groups such as social class (Lipset and Rokkan, 1967), has evolved due to the erosion of traditional class-based voting patterns driven by socioeconomic shifts. This shift has led to a greater emphasis on individualistic concerns rather than collective identities. However, contemporary political dynamics indicate a realignment towards cultural and transnational cleavages, such as globalist vs. nationalist and urban vs. rural divisions. Unlike traditional class-based cleavages, these new divisions intersect with, rather than reinforce, class and ideological differences, leading to more fluid and sometimes contradictory affiliations—for instance, individuals may be economically left-wing but socially conservative, or ethnically a minority yet economically privileged. Therefore, while traditional cleavages have shifted, Lipset’s model remains relevant in explaining how cross-group interactions mitigate polarization and contribute to democratic resilience in diverse societies. However, if Lipset’s logic was fully applicable, societies with significant cleavage overlap should experience lower polarization—yet this fails to account for cases like the U.S., where polarization remains high despite the presence of cross-cutting affiliations."

"evaluate my essay based on these marking criteria and give each sention a score: Seymour Martin Lipset writes in 'Some Social Requisites of Democracy' (1959, p.97):

 '...the chances for stable democracy are enhanced to the extent that social strata, groups and individuals have a number of cross-cutting politically relevant affiliations. To the degree that a significant proportion of the population is pulled among conflicting forces, such groups and individuals have an interest in reducing the intensity of political conflict.'  

Please discuss the potential and limitations of this idea of 'cross-cutting cleavages' in the context of contemporary forms of polarisation. 

A near-canonical claim among political scientists is that societies with cross-cutting cleavages—divisions along multiple, overlapping social, economic, or political lines—tend to experience lower polarization and greater stability (Selway, 2011). However, this assumption, which has long been accepted within pluralist and democratic theories, is increasingly subjected to empirical scrutiny.
This essay argues that while Lipset’s model was once a useful framework for understanding democratic stability, it has become outdated because contemporary polarization is primarily driven by media structures and consumption, rather than social cleavages. Empirical research demonstrates that algorithmic curation (Lelkes et al., 2015), selective exposure (Westerwick et al., 2017), and affective polarization (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015) now override the moderating effects of cross-cutting cleavages, making structural media reforms an essential focus for depolarization efforts. While historical political divisions were influenced by cross-cutting identities, today’s digital media landscape, characterized by algorithm-driven news feeds, echo chambers, and hyper-partisan content, has intensified ideological and affective mechanisms that deepen partisan hostility (Bail et al., 2018). This essay will first explain the theoretical foundations of cross-cutting cleavage theory, exploring its historical role in fostering democratic stability. Then, it will argue that contemporary polarization is shaped primarily by media ecosystems, specifying how algorithmic curation, social media silos, and partisan information networks have rendered Lipset’s logic empirically outdated. Ultimately, it will contend that fostering a socially diverse electorate will not reduce polarization unless media structures are reformed through regulatory and policy interventions.

Cross-cutting cleavages as a stabilising force
In 'Some Social Requisites of Democracy'  Lipset (1959) argues that democratic stability is strengthened when individuals hold multiple, overlapping group affiliations, as they prevent the consolidation of all social divisions into a singular political conflict, thereby reducing polarization.

Taylor and Rae (1969) quantitatively measured the effects of cross-cutting cleavages through the concept of cross-cutting index (XC), which evaluates the degree to which different social cleavages overlap within a society.

As highlighted by Selway (2011) and McCoy et al. (2018), modern societies are more multidimensional than ever. The cleavage model, which historically identified individuals along a Left–Right ideological scale based on their affiliation with social groups such as social class (Lipset and Rokkan, 1967), has evolved due to the erosion of traditional class-based voting patterns driven by socioeconomic shifts. This shift has led to a greater emphasis on individualistic concerns rather than collective identities.

However, if Lipset’s logic was fully applicable, societies with significant cleavage overlap should experience lower polarization—yet this fails to account for cases like the U.S., where polarization remains high despite the presence of cross-cutting affiliations.

Media dynamics as polarisation dictators
Historically, American politics exhibited strong cross-cutting cleavages. For example, the Democratic Party once included both conservative Southern Democrats and economically progressive Northeastern liberals, while the Republican Party had both pro-business elites and socially moderate suburban voters. However, since the 1980s, partisan sorting has aligned race, religion, geography, and ideology with party affiliation, reducing ideological diversity within political coalitions (Mason, 2016), which presents political opposition in increasingly moralized and existential terms (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). Rather than moderating political behavior, the dissolution of cross-cutting media spaces has contributed to a rigid ""us vs. them"" mentality, where political identity dictates social relationships, trust networks, and even economic decisions. Driving a causal relationship from Lipset’s logic, such high polarisation should be a consequence of no overlapping identities. Then how do we explain high polarisation in democracies with historically cross-cutting cleavages?
A significant body of research (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015; Van der Meer & Hameleers, 2020; Tucker et al, 2018; Bail et al., 2018) found that political polarization is no longer primarily determined by social identities but by media consumption patterns. While social structures still generate cross-cutting identities, their moderating effect has weakened as individuals are no longer primarily socialized through direct personal experiences with diverse groups. Instead, algorithmic curation within digital media ecosystems segments audiences into ideologically homogenous communities, reinforcing singular, identity-based cleavages and amplifying affective polarization. At the core of these concerns is a triangular relationship: social media, political polarization, and disinformation. Social media platforms provide unprecedented access to political news, enabling citizens to bypass traditional media gatekeepers. This decentralization was initially seen as beneficial, allowing independent journalism and civic actors to thrive. Scholars such as Mutz (2002) have argued that online spaces can facilitate cross-cutting exposure and foster political tolerance. However, empirical evidence suggests the opposite. Lelkes et al. (2017) found that broadband expansion has reinforced ideological echo chambers rather than fostering cross-cutting exposure, as hyper-partisan digital environments isolate individuals into ideologically homogenous communities, reinforcing us-vs-them mentalities and reducing the likelihood of political compromise. Similarly, Van der Meer & Hameleers (2020) have shown that algorithm-driven news feeds on social media platforms such as Instagram, X, and TikTok have intensified confirmation bias, as they filter political content in a way that minimizes exposure to countervailing views, even when users themselves do not actively seek out such echo chambers, increasingly  exposing them only to information that aligns with their preexisting beliefs. As a result, media organizations rely their business models on maximizing outrage and engagement through sensationalized, conflict-driven coverage, and highly polarized narratives (Graham & Svolik, 2018). This dynamic, as argued by Iyengar and Westwood (2015), foster affective polarization, creating an environment where partisans view political opponents as existential threats rather than legitimate rivals and posing a great threat to democratic stability. Political identity then becomes is no longer merely an electoral preference but an all-encompassing social marker, a dominant social identity, shaping personal relationships, workplaces, and even economic behavior (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015).

The effects of this media-driven polarization are profound and dangerous. Rational debate is replaced by affective tribalism, reinforcing negative partisanship, where individuals define their political identity primarily through hostility toward the opposing party rather than loyalty to their own (Mason, 2016). This has direct consequence toward voting behaviour, as voters prioritize ideological loyalty over democratic principles. Graham and Svolik (2018) demonstrate that  when confronted with anti-democratic behavior by their preferred party, most voters are unwilling to penalize it if it benefits the opposing party, reinforcing the notion that contemporary partisanship is an entrenched social identity rather than a fluid political affiliation. As polarization deepens and ideological rigidity entrenches, citizens become more susceptible to disinformation—defined as the deliberate spread of false or misleading information—that delegitimises democratic institutions, further undermining institutional trust, fuelling disengagement from democratic processes. For instance, the 2023 Gallup poll reveals that only one-third of Americans trust mainstream media, suggesting that individuals are increasingly consuming news from partisan or alternative sources that align with their pre-existing beliefs. In this environment, even objective reporting is perceived as biased, further weakening the possibility of cross-cutting discourse. The decline of trust in media has also reinforced elite polarization, as politicians increasingly cater to fragmented and ideologically homogenous audiences, reducing incentives for compromise. Ultimately, beyond the risk to stability lies the essence of democracy itself, particularly in terms of participation. This raises the question of how to ensure active involvement in democratic processes.

If Lipset's Theory is Outdated, What Should Take Its Place? 
It has been argued that Lipset’s (1959) theory of cross-cutting cleavages assumes that individuals with diverse social affiliations will mediate between competing groups, thereby mitigating polarization and fostering democratic stability. However, this assumption no longer holds in contemporary democracies, where polarization is less a function of social structures and more a consequence of ideological and affective mechanisms embedded within media environments (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). While past divisions—such as class and religion—intersected in ways that encouraged political moderation, the digital media landscape has fundamentally reshaped political identities. Rather than fostering cross-cutting engagement, today’s algorithmically driven media environment entrenches ideological divisions, limiting the opportunities for exposure to opposing viewpoints (Lelkes et al., 2015). The key determinant of democratic stability is no longer the composition of society but the architecture of media exposure, which dictates whether individuals ever encounter cross-cutting perspectives in the first place. This highlights a crucial shift: exposure to ideological diversity now depends less on the inherent social diversity of a population and more on the structural design of digital platforms, which often reinforce rather than bridge political divides. In other words, cross-cutting cleavages can no longer function as effective moderators of polarization if individuals are systematically shielded from countervailing viewpoints by media silos. This shift has profound implications for how polarization should be addressed. While traditional models of political moderation emphasized the role of diverse social affiliations, the contemporary challenge lies in countering the structural forces that isolate individuals within ideologically homogeneous digital environments. The consequences of this isolation are significant: individuals become more entrenched in their beliefs, less willing to engage in compromise, and increasingly hostile toward political opponents. Therefore, breaking media silos is more critical than restructuring social groups, as even the most diverse societies will remain polarized if their citizens are denied exposure to cross-cutting perspectives. The urgency of addressing media silos cannot be overstated—without intervention, digital echo chambers will continue to drive political antagonism, weakening democratic stability. Nevertheless, efforts to promote media literacy face challenges in mitigating these effects. Simply exposing individuals to contrary perspectives is inadequate; research by Van der Meer & Hameleers (2020) has shown that individuals often reject information that contradicts their beliefs due to reactance bias. Bail et al. (2018) found that when individuals are confronted with political messages from ideological opponents, they frequently react defensively, reinforcing their pre-existing beliefs and becoming more ideologically extreme. This phenomenon, known as the backfire effect or motivated reasoning, is particularly pronounced among conservatives in the study. As a result, attempts to introduce cross-cutting perspectives often fail, further entrenching polarization and making bipartisan compromise increasingly difficult (Guess, Nyhan, & Reifler, 2020). Similarly, Westerwick et al. (2017) highlight the impact of confirmation bias, showing that individuals prioritize attitude-consistent content over credibility. In some cases, media literacy programs may even exacerbate polarization by heightening selective exposure. This underscores the need for depolarization strategies that go beyond passive exposure to conflicting viewpoints and instead emphasize active engagement, cognitive reflection, and deliberative media environments. One promising approach is News Media Literacy (NML), which aims to equip individuals with critical thinking skills to assess media content (Van der Meer & Hameleers, 2020). At its core, NML seeks to provide citizens with the tools to recognize bias, evaluate credibility, and navigate media environments in an informed manner. However, media literacy alone is not a panacea. While it can help mitigate selective exposure, individuals still rely heavily on heuristic-based judgments, often dismissing counterarguments if they conflict with their preexisting beliefs. This highlights the importance of fostering active engagement with conflicting viewpoints rather than relying solely on traditional media literacy efforts. To tackle modern polarization effectively, strategies must prioritize ongoing, structured engagement with ideological opponents, rather than simply increasing exposure to diverse content. This calls for a structural approach to media reform, including greater transparency in algorithmic content curation, platform accountability, and targeted digital literacy programs designed to counteract reactance bias. It is crucial to move beyond passive exposure to partisan content and prioritize ongoing, active engagement with conflicting viewpoints. Implementing such measures, however, presents challenges. In polarized societies, regulatory interventions may be viewed as partisan tools, further entrenching distrust in democratic institutions (Graham & Svolik, 2018). This makes it crucial for reforms to be designed in ways that uphold democratic principles while minimizing the risk of political weaponization. Without these structural measures, political polarization will continue to deepen, rendering traditional cross-cutting cleavages ineffective in stabilizing democratic societies. Ultimately, the survival of democracy in the digital age will depend not on social composition alone but on whether societies can mitigate the polarizing effects of digital media while preserving the fundamental freedoms that underpin democratic governance.

Conclusion 
In conclusion, this essay has demonstrated that while Lipset’s theory of cross-cutting cleavages once provided a compelling framework for understanding democratic stability, it is increasingly insufficient in explaining contemporary polarization. Today, polarization is less a product of social composition and more a consequence of digital media ecosystems that fragment the public sphere, reinforce ideological insularity, and amplify affective divisions. In this environment, traditional cross-cutting identities fail to moderate political conflict, as individuals no longer engage with diverse perspectives in meaningful ways. Addressing this challenge requires moving beyond outdated assumptions about social structure and focusing on what people read and watch, making media structure, rather than social diversity, the primary battleground for mitigating polarization. Efforts to promote media literacy, though well-intentioned, risk exacerbating polarization through cognitive biases such as reactance and selective exposure. Regulatory interventions, while necessary, must strike a delicate balance between curbing algorithmic polarization and safeguarding democratic freedoms. Ultimately, the survival of democratic pluralism in the digital age hinges on a structural reconfiguration of the media landscape—one that fosters deliberation, transparency, and exposure to diverse viewpoints. Without such reforms, cross-cutting cleavages will remain an ineffective buffer against polarization, and democratic stability will continue to erode."

INTRO 

A near-canonical claim among political scientists is that societies with cross-cutting cleavages—divisions along multiple, overlapping social, economic, or political lines—tend to experience lower polarization and greater stability (Selway, 2011). However, this assumption, which has long been accepted within pluralist and democratic theories, is increasingly subjected to empirical scrutiny.
This essay argues that while Lipset’s model was once a useful framework for understanding democratic stability, it has become outdated because contemporary polarization is primarily driven by media structures and consumption, rather than social cleavages. Empirical research demonstrates that algorithmic curation (Lelkes et al., 2015), selective exposure (Westerwick et al., 2017), and affective polarization (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015) now override the moderating effects of cross-cutting cleavages, making structural media reforms an essential focus for depolarization efforts.
While historical political divisions were influenced by cross-cutting identities, today’s digital media landscape, characterized by algorithm-driven news feeds, echo chambers, and hyper-partisan content, has intensified ideological and affective mechanisms that deepen partisan hostility (Bail et al., 2018). This essay will first explain the theoretical foundations of cross-cutting cleavage theory, exploring its historical role in fostering democratic stability. Then, it will argue that contemporary polarization is shaped primarily by media ecosystems, specifying how algorithmic curation, social media silos, and partisan information networks have rendered Lipset’s logic empirically outdated. Ultimately, it will contend that fostering a socially diverse electorate will not reduce polarization unless media structures are reformed through regulatory and policy interventions.

Cross-cutting cleavages as a stabilising force
In 'Some Social Requisites of Democracy'  Lipset (1959) argues that democratic stability is strengthened when individuals hold multiple, overlapping group affiliations, as they prevent the consolidation of all social divisions into a singular political conflict, thereby reducing polarization.
On the sociological dimension, Lipset (1959) argues that individuals that belong to multiple, sometimes conflicting, identity groups, tend to develop a form of political moderation, acting as bridges between competing factions and reducing the likelihood of deep societal divisions (Lipset, 1960; Lipset and Rokkan, 1967). Similarly, Coser (1956) and Dahrendorf (1959) argued that outright social conflict is less severe when cleavages cut across one another, rather than aligning in a way that hardens political antagonisms, fostering dialogue rather than entrenchment (Gordon et al, 2015). From a political-institutional perspective, Truman (1951) and Dahl (1956) argue that crosscutting cleavages increase the likelihood of coalition-building, thus integrating marginalized groups into the political process , and reduce the likelihood of extreme political behavior. Taylor and Rae (1969) quantitatively measured the effects of cross-cutting cleavages through the concept of cross-cutting index (XC), which evaluates the degree to which different social cleavages overlap within a society. Their findings indicate that societies with high levels of cross-cutting cleavages tend to exhibit greater political stability, whereas those with rigid, reinforcing cleavages are more prone to polarization and conflict. Indeed, if a society is too homogeneous—or too heterogeneous—across racial, linguistic, or religious cleavages, democratic stability is unlikely. Moreover, Selway’s (2011) empirical studies have supported this claim, showing that societies with high cross-cutting cleavages tend to experience higher economic growth and greater political stability, in contrast to those where ethnic, religious, and economic divisions are deeply intertwined, making them more vulnerable to democratic erosion. In the context of contemporary forms of polarization, the cross-cutting theory model continues to illustrate patterns of political competition and democratic stability in Western Europe. As highlighted by Selway (2011) and McCoy et al. (2018), modern societies are more multidimensional than ever. The cleavage model, which historically identified individuals along a Left–Right ideological scale based on their affiliation with social groups such as social class (Lipset and Rokkan, 1967), has evolved due to the erosion of traditional class-based voting patterns driven by socioeconomic shifts. This shift has led to a greater emphasis on individualistic concerns rather than collective identities. However, contemporary political dynamics indicate a realignment towards cultural and transnational cleavages, such as globalist vs. nationalist and urban vs. rural divisions. Unlike traditional class-based cleavages, these new divisions intersect with, rather than reinforce, class and ideological differences, leading to more fluid and sometimes contradictory affiliations—for instance, individuals may be economically left-wing but socially conservative, or ethnically a minority yet economically privileged. Therefore, while traditional cleavages have shifted, Lipset’s model remains relevant in explaining how cross-group interactions mitigate polarization and contribute to democratic resilience in diverse societies. However, if Lipset’s logic was fully applicable, societies with significant cleavage overlap should experience lower polarization—yet this fails to account for cases like the U.S., where polarization remains high despite the presence of cross-cutting affiliations.

Media dynamics as polarisation dictators
Historically, American politics exhibited strong cross-cutting cleavages. For example, the Democratic Party once included both conservative Southern Democrats and economically progressive Northeastern liberals, while the Republican Party had both pro-business elites and socially moderate suburban voters. However, since the 1980s, partisan sorting has aligned race, religion, geography, and ideology with party affiliation, reducing ideological diversity within political coalitions (Mason, 2016), which presents political opposition in increasingly moralized and existential terms (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). Rather than moderating political behavior, the dissolution of cross-cutting media spaces has contributed to a rigid ""us vs. them"" mentality, where political identity dictates social relationships, trust networks, and even economic decisions. Driving a causal relationship from Lipset’s logic, such high polarisation should be a consequence of no overlapping identities. Then how do we explain high polarisation in democracies with historically cross-cutting cleavages?
A significant body of research (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015; Van der Meer & Hameleers, 2020; Tucker et al, 2018; Bail et al., 2018) found that political polarization is no longer primarily determined by social identities but by media consumption patterns. While social structures still generate cross-cutting identities, their moderating effect has weakened as individuals are no longer primarily socialized through direct personal experiences with diverse groups. Instead, algorithmic curation within digital media ecosystems segments audiences into ideologically homogenous communities, reinforcing singular, identity-based cleavages and amplifying affective polarization. At the core of these concerns is a triangular relationship: social media, political polarization, and disinformation. 

Social media platforms provide unprecedented access to political news, enabling citizens to bypass traditional media gatekeepers. This decentralization was initially seen as beneficial, allowing independent journalism and civic actors to thrive. Scholars such as Mutz (2002) have argued that online spaces can facilitate cross-cutting exposure and foster political tolerance. However, empirical evidence suggests the opposite. Lelkes et al. (2017) found that broadband expansion has reinforced ideological echo chambers rather than fostering cross-cutting exposure, as hyper-partisan digital environments isolate individuals into ideologically homogenous communities, reinforcing us-vs-them mentalities and reducing the likelihood of political compromise. Similarly, Van der Meer & Hameleers (2020) have shown that algorithm-driven news feeds on social media platforms such as Instagram, X, and TikTok have intensified confirmation bias, as they filter political content in a way that minimizes exposure to countervailing views, even when users themselves do not actively seek out such echo chambers, increasingly  exposing them only to information that aligns with their preexisting beliefs. As a result, media organizations rely their business models on maximizing outrage and engagement through sensationalized, conflict-driven coverage, and highly polarized narratives (Graham & Svolik, 2018). This dynamic, as argued by Iyengar and Westwood (2015), foster affective polarization, creating an environment where partisans view political opponents as existential threats rather than legitimate rivals and posing a great threat to democratic stability. Political identity then becomes is no longer merely an electoral preference but an all-encompassing social marker, a dominant social identity, shaping personal relationships, workplaces, and even economic behavior (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015).

The effects of this media-driven polarization are profound and dangerous. Rational debate is replaced by affective tribalism, reinforcing negative partisanship, where individuals define their political identity primarily through hostility toward the opposing party rather than loyalty to their own (Mason, 2016). This has direct consequence toward voting behaviour, as voters prioritize ideological loyalty over democratic principles. Graham and Svolik (2018) demonstrate that  when confronted with anti-democratic behavior by their preferred party, most voters are unwilling to penalize it if it benefits the opposing party, reinforcing the notion that contemporary partisanship is an entrenched social identity rather than a fluid political affiliation.
As polarization deepens and ideological rigidity entrenches, citizens become more susceptible to disinformation—defined as the deliberate spread of false or misleading information—that delegitimises democratic institutions, further undermining institutional trust, fuelling disengagement from democratic processes. For instance, the 2023 Gallup poll reveals that only one-third of Americans trust mainstream media, suggesting that individuals are increasingly consuming news from partisan or alternative sources that align with their pre-existing beliefs. In this environment, even objective reporting is perceived as biased, further weakening the possibility of cross-cutting discourse. The decline of trust in media has also reinforced elite polarization, as politicians increasingly cater to fragmented and ideologically homogenous audiences, reducing incentives for compromise. Ultimately, beyond the risk to stability lies the essence of democracy itself, particularly in terms of participation. This raises the question of how to ensure active involvement in democratic processes.

If Lipset's Theory is Outdated, What Should Take Its Place? 
Returning to the central argument, Lipset’s (1959) theory of cross-cutting cleavages assumes that individuals with diverse social affiliations will mediate between competing groups, thereby mitigating polarization and fostering democratic stability. However, this assumption no longer holds in contemporary democracies, where polarization is no longer driven by social structures but by the ideological and affective mechanisms embedded within media environments (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015).
While past divisions—such as class and religion—intersected in ways that encouraged political moderation, the digital media landscape has fundamentally reshaped political identities. Rather than fostering cross-cutting engagement, today’s algorithmically-driven media environment entrenches ideological divisions (Lelkes et al., 2015). The key determinant of democratic stability is no longer the composition of society but the architecture of media exposure, which dictates whether individuals ever encounter cross-cutting perspectives in the first place (The text effectively highlights the shift in determining factors for democratic stability but could be improved by emphasizing the impact of media exposure on cross-cutting perspectives.). This shift has profound implications for how polarization should be addressed (example). The main concern lies in individuals being systematically isolated from ideologically conflicting perspectives, rather than merely lacking diverse social affiliations (The text effectively identifies a crucial concern but could be strengthened by emphasizing the impact of isolation from conflicting perspectives on polarization.). Therefore, breaking media silos is more critical than restructuring social groups (The statement effectively prioritizes media silos over social group restructuring but could be improved by highlighting the urgency of addressing media silos in combating polarization.). Nevertheless, efforts to promote media literacy face challenges in mitigating these effects. Merely exposing individuals to contrary perspectives is inadequate, as research by Van der Meer & Hameleers (2020) has shown that individuals often reject information that contradicts their beliefs due to reactance bias. Bail et al (2018) showed that when individuals are exposed to political messages from ideological opponents, they often react defensively, reinforcing their pre-existing beliefs and becoming more ideologically extreme. This phenomenon, known as the backfire effect or motivated reasoning, is particularly pronounced among conservatives in the study. This means that attempts to introduce cross-cutting perspectives are often rejected outright, further entrenching polarization and making bipartisan compromise increasingly difficult  (Guess, Nyhan, & Reifler, 2020). Similarly, Westerwick et al. (2017) highlight confirmation bias, showing that people prioritize attitude-consistent content over credibility. In some cases, media literacy programs may even exacerbate polarization by increasing selective exposure. As a result, depolarization strategies must move beyond passive exposure and instead prioritize active engagement, cognitive reflection, and deliberative media environments. 
One approach is News Media Literacy (NML), which aims to equip individuals with critical thinking skills to assess media content (Van der Meer & Hameleers, 2020). At its core, NML seeks to equip citizens with the tools to recognize bias, assess credibility, and navigate media environments in an informed manner. Yet, media literacy alone is not a panacea. While it can mitigate selective exposure, individuals still rely heavily on heuristic-based judgements, often dismissing counterarguments if they conflict with their preexisting beliefs.
To tackle modern polarization effectively, it is crucial to move beyond passive exposure to diverse perspectives and prioritize ongoing, active engagement with conflicting viewpoints (The text provides a valuable insight into addressing modern polarization but could be strengthened by emphasizing the importance of active engagement with conflicting viewpoints.). This calls for a structural approach to media reform, including greater transparency in algorithmic content curation, platform accountability, and targeted digital literacy programs designed to counteract reactance bias(example - The text effectively suggests solutions for addressing polarization but could be improved by emphasizing the need for structural media reform and the specific strategies involved.). It is with mentioning that in polarized societies, regulatory interventions may be viewed as partisan tools, further entrenching distrust in democratic institutions (Graham & Svolik, 2018).
However, without these measures, political polarization will continue to deepen, rendering traditional cross-cutting cleavages ineffective in stabilizing democratic societies.
Ultimately, the survival of democracy in the digital age will depend on whether societies can mitigate these risks while preserving the fundamental freedoms that underpin democratic governance.

Conclusion 
This essay has argued that while the concept of cross-cutting cleavages remains relevant, contemporary polarization stems less from social composition and more from media silos that restrict cross-cutting information flow. Democratic stability today depends not just on who people are, but on what they read and watch—making media structure, rather than social diversity, the primary battleground for mitigating polarization. However, proposed solutions must be critically examined. Media literacy, while valuable, is insufficient alone and can sometimes backfire. Regulatory interventions must balance democratic integrity with concerns over free expression. In conclusion, tackling modern polarization demands a structural approach that emphasizes algorithmic transparency, the advancement of deliberative media platforms, and a reinvention of civic engagement practices in the digital era."

Driving a causal relationship from Lipset’s logic we should see polarisation where there’s no overlapping identities. Then how do we explain high polarisation in democracies with historically cross-cutting cleavages?

Similarly, Coser (1956) and Dahrendorf (1959) argued that outright social conflict is less severe when cleavages cut across one another, rather than aligning in a way that hardens political antagonisms, fostering dialogue rather than entrenchment (Gordon et al, 2015). From a political-institutional perspective, Truman (1951) and Dahl (1956) argue that crosscutting cleavages increase the likelihood of coalition-building, thus integrating marginalized groups into the political process​, and reduce the likelihood of extreme political behavior. Taylor and Rae (1969) quantitatively measured the effects of cross-cutting cleavages through the concept of cross-cutting index (XC), which evaluates the degree to which different social cleavages overlap within a society. Their findings indicate that societies with high levels of cross-cutting cleavages tend to exhibit greater political stability, whereas those with rigid, reinforcing cleavages are more prone to polarization and conflict. Indeed, if a society is too homogeneous—or too heterogeneous—across racial, linguistic, or religious cleavages, democratic stability is unlikely. Moreover, Selway’s (2011) empirical studies have supported this claim, showing that societies with high cross-cutting cleavages tend to experience higher economic growth and greater political stability, in contrast to those where ethnic, religious, and economic divisions are deeply intertwined, making them more vulnerable to democratic erosion. In the context of contemporary forms of polarization, the cross-cutting theory model continues to illustrate patterns of political competition and democratic stability in Western Europe. As highlighted by Selway (2011) and McCoy et al. (2018) modern societies are more multidimensional than ever. The cleavage model, which historically identified individuals along a Left–Right ideological scale based on their affiliation with social groups such as social class (Lipset and Rokkan, 1967), has evolved due to the erosion of traditional class-based voting patterns driven by socioeconomic shifts. This shift has led to a greater emphasis on individualistic concerns rather than collective identities. However, contemporary political dynamics indicate a realignment towards cultural and transnational cleavages, such as globalist vs. nationalist and urban vs. rural divisions. Unlike traditional class-based cleavages, these new divisions intersect with, rather than reinforce, class and ideological differences, leading to more fluid and sometimes contradictory affiliations—for instance, individuals may be economically left-wing but socially conservative, or ethnically a minority yet economically privileged. Therefore, while traditional cleavages have shifted, Lipset’s model remains relevant in explaining how cross-group interactions mitigate polarization and contribute to democratic resilience in diverse societies. However, if Lipset’s logic was fully applicable, societies with significant cleavage overlap should experience lower polarization—yet this fails to account for cases like the U.S., where polarization remains high despite the presence of cross-cutting affiliations. The following section will examine why this discrepancy occurs.

Media dynamics as polarisation dictators (limitations of this idea of 'cross-cutting cleavages' in the context of contemporary forms of polarisation)
Driving a causal relationship from Lipset’s logic we should see polarisation where there’s no overlapping identities. Then how do we explain high polarisation in democracies with historically cross-cutting cleavages?
A significant body of research (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015; Van der Meer & Hameleers, 2020; Tucker et al, 2018; Bail et al., 2018) found that political polarization is no longer primarily determined by social identities but by media consumption patterns. While social structures still generate cross-cutting identities, their moderating effect has weakened as individuals are no longer primarily socialized through direct personal experiences with diverse groups. Instead, algorithmic curation within digital media ecosystems segments audiences into ideologically homogenous communities, reinforcing singular, identity-based cleavages and amplifying affective polarization. At the core of these concerns is a triangular relationship: social media, political polarization, and disinformation.
Social media platforms provide unprecedented access to political news, enabling citizens to bypass traditional media gatekeepers. This decentralization was initially seen as beneficial, allowing independent journalism and civic actors to thrive. Scholars such as Mutz (2002) have argued that online spaces can facilitate cross-cutting exposure and political tolerance. However, Lelkes et al. (YEAR) find that broadband expansion has the opposite effect, reinforcing ideological echo chambers. Historically, individuals were exposed to a broad range of political perspectives through shared media experiences, such as national newspapers or television networks. Today, hyper-partisan digital environments isolate individuals into ideologically homogenous communities, reinforcing us-vs-them mentalities and reducing the likelihood of political compromise.
The rise of algorithm-driven news feeds on social media platforms such as Instagram, X, and TikTok has intensified confirmation bias, as individuals are increasingly exposed only to information that aligns with their preexisting beliefs (Van der Meer & Hameleers, 2020). As Bakshy et al. (2015) show, platforms like Facebook filter political content in a way that minimizes exposure to countervailing views, even when users themselves do not actively seek out such echo chambers. These platforms use personalized content curation to maximize user engagement, which inadvertently fuels political segregation, limiting individuals' exposure to alternative viewpoints and deepening partisan identities. This creates highly polarized narratives, as media organizations' business models rely on maximizing outrage and engagement through sensationalized, conflict-driven coverage (Graham & Svolik, 2018).
The effects of this media-driven polarization are profound. Studies show that online political discourse is increasingly characterized by dehumanization of political opponents, moral outrage, and conspiratorial thinking. Iyengar and Westwood (2015) argue that social media does not merely reflect partisan divides but actively transforms political identity into a deeply entrenched social marker. As a result, individuals increasingly define themselves by opposition to political rivals, shaping personal relationships, workplaces, and even economic behavior. Research differentiates between ideological polarization (divergence in policy beliefs) and affective polarization (hostility toward political out-groups), with the latter posing a greater threat to democratic stability. While ideological polarization is a natural feature of democracy, affective polarization fosters an environment where partisans view political opponents as existential threats rather than legitimate rivals.
This suggests that individuals no longer see their political opponents as legitimate competitors but as threats to their way of life, eroding the conditions for democratic stability. This is reinforced by negative partisanship, where individuals define their political identity primarily through hostility toward the opposing party rather than loyalty to their own (Mason, 2016). By replacing rational debate with affective tribalism, digital media landscapes entrench ideological rigidity, making cross-cutting cleavages less effective in diffusing political conflict. As a result, political identity has become a dominant social identity, reinforcing polarization not just in electoral behavior but in everyday life.
Van der Meer & Hameleers (2020) demonstrate that even media literacy interventions struggle to counteract these effects, as individuals actively resist information that challenges their worldview, a phenomenon known as reactance bias. This means that attempts to introduce cross-cutting perspectives are often rejected outright, further entrenching polarization and making bipartisan compromise increasingly difficult.
As polarization deepens, citizens become more susceptible to disinformation that delegitimizes democratic institutions. Disinformation—defined as the deliberate spread of false or misleading information—has become one of the most effective tools for manipulating public opinion. Unlike traditional propaganda, digital disinformation is decentralized, making it harder to regulate. Furthermore, Graham and Svolik (2018) demonstrate that in polarized societies where partisanship has become an all-encompassing identity, voters prioritize ideological loyalty over democratic principles. Their research shows that when confronted with anti-democratic behavior by their preferred party, most voters are unwilling to penalize it, reinforcing the notion that contemporary partisanship is an entrenched social identity rather than a fluid political affiliation. This further erodes the moderating effects of cross-cutting cleavages, as political behavior is now driven by loyalty to in-groups rather than issue-based reasoning or democratic norms.

Case Study: The United States and the Effects of Algorithmic Polarization 
Historically, American politics exhibited strong cross-cutting cleavages. For example, the Democratic Party once included both conservative Southern Democrats and economically progressive Northeastern liberals, while the Republican Party had both pro-business elites and socially moderate suburban voters. However, since the 1980s, partisan sorting has aligned race, religion, geography, and ideology with party affiliation, reducing ideological diversity within political coalitions (Mason, 2016). This shift has been further entrenched by the rise of hyper-partisan media, which presents political opposition in increasingly moralized and existential terms (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). Rather than moderating political behavior, the dissolution of cross-cutting media spaces has contributed to a rigid ""us vs. them"" mentality, where political identity dictates social relationships, trust networks, and even economic decisions. The implications of this media-driven polarization are profound. The 2023 Gallup poll reveals that only one-third of Americans trust mainstream media, suggesting that individuals are increasingly consuming news from partisan or alternative sources that align with their pre-existing beliefs. This shift aligns with Graham & Svolik (2018), who argue that polarization has become so entrenched that many voters prioritize ideological loyalty over democratic norms. In this environment, even objective reporting is perceived as biased, further weakening the possibility of cross-cutting discourse. The decline of trust in media has also reinforced elite polarization, as politicians increasingly cater to fragmented and ideologically homogenous audiences, reducing incentives for compromise. Ultimately, the U.S. case illustrates how the erosion of cross-cutting cleavages in media consumption has accelerated political polarization. Unlike Lipset’s model, where overlapping social identities diffuse conflict, modern American politics is increasingly defined by reinforcing cleavages that align ideology, identity, and media consumption into mutually exclusive camps. Unless trust in mainstream media is restored or mechanisms for cross-cutting media exposure are introduced, polarization is likely to deepen, making bipartisan cooperation and democratic stability increasingly difficult.
If Lipset is Outdated, What Should Replace Him? 
Returning to the central argument, Lipset’s (1959) theory of cross-cutting cleavages assumes that individuals with diverse social affiliations will mediate between competing groups, thereby mitigating polarization and fostering democratic stability. However, this assumption no longer holds in contemporary democracies, where polarization is no longer driven by social structures but by the ideological and affective mechanisms embedded within media environments (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015).
While past divisions—such as class and religion—intersected in ways that encouraged political moderation, the digital media landscape has fundamentally reshaped political identities. Rather than fostering cross-cutting engagement, today’s algorithmically-driven media environment entrenches ideological divisions (Lelkes et al., 2015). The key determinant of democratic stability is no longer the composition of society but the architecture of media exposure, which dictates whether individuals ever encounter cross-cutting perspectives in the first place.
This shift has profound implications for how polarization should be addressed. The core issue is not that individuals lack diverse social affiliations but that they are systematically shielded from ideologically dissonant perspectives. Therefore, breaking media silos is more critical than restructuring social groups. However, merely exposing individuals to opposing viewpoints is insufficient; research suggests that counter-attitudinal exposure can intensify polarization rather than mitigate it (Guess, Nyhan, & Reifler, 2020).
As a result, depolarization strategies must move beyond passive exposure and instead prioritize active engagement, cognitive reflection, and deliberative media environments. One approach is News Media Literacy (NML), which aims to equip individuals with critical thinking skills to assess media content (Van der Meer & Hameleers, 2020). Yet, media literacy alone is not a panacea. While it can mitigate selective exposure, individuals still rely heavily on heuristic-based judgments, often dismissing counterarguments if they conflict with their preexisting beliefs (Guess et al., 2020).
Addressing modern polarization requires more than passive exposure to diverse perspectives; it necessitates active, sustained engagement with competing viewpoints. This calls for a structural approach to media reform, including greater transparency in algorithmic content curation, the promotion of deliberative media platforms, and targeted digital literacy programs designed to counteract reactance bias. Without these measures, political polarization will continue to deepen, rendering traditional cross-cutting cleavages ineffective in stabilizing democratic societies.

Conclusion 
In conclusion, this essay has argued that while the concept of cross-cutting cleavages remains relevant, contemporary polarization stems less from social composition and more from media silos that restrict cross-cutting information flow. Democratic stability today depends not just on who people are, but on what they read and watch—making media structure, rather than social diversity, the primary battleground for mitigating polarization."

INTRO 

A near-canonical claim among political scientists is that societies with crosscutting cleavages—divisions along multiple, overlapping social, economic, or political lines—tend to experience lower polarization and greater stability (Selway, 2011). However, this assumption, which has long been accepted within pluralist and democratic theories, is increasingly subjected to theoretical scrutiny.  
This essay argues that while Lipset’s model was once a useful framework for understanding polarization, it is now outdated because contemporary polarization is primarily driven by media structures and consumption rather than social cleavages. While past political divisions were shaped by cross-cutting identities, today’s information environment—dominated by algorithmic curation, disinformation, and selective exposure—reinforces ideological echo chambers and exacerbates partisan hostility. As a result, solutions to polarization must focus not on fostering cross-cutting social affiliations, but on restructuring media environments and promoting media literacy interventions. First, it will explain the foundations of cross-cutting cleavage theory, assessing its role as a stabilizing force in democratic societies. Then, it will argue that the recent emergence of transnational cleavages undermines Lipset logic, as polarisation still prevails in cross-cutting societies. This is because instead of social structures automatically moderating conflict, media dynamics now dictate political (affective) polarization, as exemplified by The U.S. case. Ultimately, it will argue that simply fostering a more socially diverse electorate will not reduce polarization unless media structures actively encourage engagement with competing viewpoints. This requires a structural approach to media reform, one that fosters regulatory and policy interventions.

As a result, democratic stability today depends not on increasing cross-cutting affiliations but on restructuring the media landscape to facilitate cross-cutting information flows.
ESSAY PLAN 

The Foundations of Crosscutting Cleavage Theory
Seymour Martin Lipset (1959) argued that democratic stability is strengthened when individuals hold multiple, overlapping group affiliations, as these cross-cutting cleavages reduce polarization by preventing the alignment of all social divisions into a single, entrenched conflict. This idea has been central to democratic theory and comparative politics, with scholars such as Lipset and Rokkan (1967) and Taylor and Rae (1969) demonstrating that when cleavages—such as class, religion, and ethnicity—do not perfectly align, individuals are pulled between conflicting loyalties. This encourages moderation, fosters political compromise, and mitigates extreme political divisions. Empirical studies have supported this claim, showing that societies with high cross-cutting cleavages tend to experience greater political stability, while those with reinforcing cleavages—where social, economic, and political identities converge—are more prone to polarization and conflict (Selway, 2011). Taylor and Rae (1969) quantitatively measured the effects of cross-cutting cleavages and found that societies where different social divisions overlap exhibit higher democratic resilience. Their findings reinforced Lipset’s proposition that individuals with multiple, sometimes contradictory, group identities act as bridges between competing factions, reducing the likelihood of deep societal divisions. Coser (1956) and Dahrendorf (1959) similarly argued that social conflict is less severe when cleavages cut across one another, rather than aligning in a way that hardens political antagonisms. According to Dahl (1966), cross-cutting cleavages also prevent the emergence of permanent majorities and minorities, which is essential for democratic consolidation, as fluid electoral coalitions reduce the risk of entrenched political exclusion. This framework was later expanded by Selway (2011), who introduced empirical indices measuring cross-cuttingness, demonstrating that societies with strong cross-cutting cleavages tend to experience higher economic growth and greater political stability, in contrast to those where ethnic, religious, and economic divisions are deeply intertwined. Beyond theoretical and empirical validation, the importance of cross-cutting cleavages is evident in historical patterns of political competition. Lipset and Rokkan’s (1967) cleavage model illustrated how democratic stability in Western Europe was historically reinforced by overlapping class, religious, and regional identities, preventing a single divide from dominating political conflict. Similarly, McCoy et al. (2018) highlight that in cases where cleavages remain fragmented across different issue areas, polarization is less severe, as individuals engage in diverse political and social networks that discourage ideological extremism. Thus, the classical cross-cutting cleavage model provides a compelling explanation for how societies mitigate political conflict. When individuals belong to multiple groups that do not fully align with a single political identity, they are less likely to adopt uncompromising partisan positions, thereby diffusing polarization. By fostering fluid coalitions, promoting cross-group interactions, and discouraging the consolidation of societal divisions into singular cleavages, this framework remains a powerful lens for understanding democratic stability. However, as later sections will explore, contemporary trends challenge the applicability of this model, as new forms of polarization emerge that are not shaped by traditional social structures but by identity-driven and media-reinforced political affiliations.

Limitations of lipset

If we get to the relevance of lipset today, McCoy et al. (2018) highlight the emergence of cultural and transnational cleavages, such as globalist vs. nationalist and urban vs. rural divisions, which intersect with class and ideological differences rather than reinforcing them. Similarly, Selway (2011) argues that modern societies are more multidimensional than ever, with individuals holding multiple, sometimes contradictory, affiliations—such as being economically left-wing but socially conservative, or ethnically minority yet economically privileged. Therefore, following Lipset’s logic we shouldn’t be able to see any polarisation in countries that experience a lot of globalisation, economic interdependence, and cultural exchange. So then how do we explain high polarization in countries such as the U.S or the UK? 

This is because Instead of social structures automatically moderating conflict, media dynamics now dictate political polarization. While social structures still produce cross-cutting identities, these identities no longer serve as a moderating force in democratic politics because the media environment overrides them. As a result, political polarization today is driven not by social composition but by the structure of information flows
Why does this happen? Because individuals are no longer politically socialized by direct personal experiences across multiple social groups, but instead by segmented media ecosystems that reinforce singular, identity-based cleavages(Iyengar & Westwood, 2015).
Iyengar and Westwood (2015) describe this process as affective polarization, where partisan identity is no longer merely about political preferences but a deeply entrenched social identity, shaping personal relationships, workplaces, and communities. This suggests that individuals no longer see their political opponents as legitimate rivals but as existential threats, eroding the conditions for democratic stability.
One of the primary drivers of this shift is the restructuring of information flows, which has undermined the cross-cutting interactions Lipset saw as essential for moderation.

Modern media, particularly digital platforms and partisan news outlets, have fundamentally altered the nature of political polarization by reinforcing ideological divisions rather than facilitating cross-cutting dialogue. Unlike traditional mass media, which once played a role in aggregating diverse perspectives, today’s fragmented media landscape encourages selective exposure, ideological echo chambers, and affective polarization (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). The rise of algorithm-driven news feeds on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube has intensified confirmation bias, as individuals are increasingly exposed only to information that aligns with their preexisting beliefs (Van der Meer & Hameleers, 2020). These platforms use personalized content curation to maximize user engagement, which inadvertently fuels political segregation, limiting individuals' exposure to alternative viewpoints and deepening partisan identities.
The effects of this media-driven polarization are profound. Iyengar and Westwood (2015) found that partisan identity now functions similarly to race or religion, meaning that political opponents are viewed not just as adversaries but as existential threats. This is reinforced by negative partisanship, where individuals define their political identity primarily through hostility toward the opposing party rather than loyalty to their own (Mason, 2016). Partisan media outlets further exacerbate this divide by crafting highly polarized narratives that depict political opponents in extreme, often moralistic terms, reducing the possibility for compromise or deliberation. Rather than acting as neutral intermediaries, media organizations have become active participants in polarization, as their business models rely on maximizing outrage and engagement through sensationalized, conflict-driven coverage (Graham & Svolik, 2018).
Some scholars argue that online spaces can facilitate cross-cutting exposure and political tolerance (Mutz, 2002). However, Lelkes et al. find that broadband expansion has the opposite effect, reinforcing ideological echo chambers. Historically, individuals were exposed to a broad range of political perspectives through shared media experiences, such as national newspapers or television networks. Today, hyper-partisan digital environments isolate individuals into ideologically homogenous communities, reinforcing us-vs-them mentalities and reducing the likelihood of political compromise. Van der Meer & Hameleers (2020) demonstrate that even media literacy interventions struggle to counteract this effect, as individuals actively resist information that challenges their worldview, a phenomenon known as reactance bias. This means that attempts to introduce cross-cutting perspectives are often rejected outright, further entrenching polarization.
Ultimately, modern media does not simply reflect existing political divisions; it actively shapes and intensifies them, making contemporary polarization qualitatively different from the cleavage-based divisions Lipset described. By replacing rational debate with affective tribalism, digital media landscapes encourage ideological rigidity, making cross-cutting cleavages less relevant in diffusing political conflict. As a result, political identity has become a dominant social identity, reinforcing polarization not just in electoral behavior but in everyday life, from workplaces to personal relationships. Without structural changes to media ecosystems, the moderating effects of cross-cutting affiliations are unlikely to regain their stabilizing role in democratic politics.
Moreover, modern identity-based cleavages do not function in the same way as traditional class, ethnic, or religious cleavages. Instead of being distributed across multiple dimensions, they have become mutually reinforcing. Iyengar and Westwood (2015) provide experimental evidence showing that partisan bias now exceeds racial or religious bias, meaning that individuals are more likely to discriminate against political opponents than against members of different ethnic or religious backgrounds. This finding challenges Lipset’s claim that political conflict can be diffused through cross-cutting affiliations, as it suggests that political identity has replaced older cleavages as the primary driver of social division.
Furthermore, Graham and Svolik (2018) demonstrate that in polarized societies where partisanship has become an all-encompassing identity, voters prioritize ideological loyalty over democratic principles. Their research shows that when confronted with anti-democratic behavior by their preferred party, most voters are unwilling to penalize it, reinforcing the notion that contemporary partisanship is an entrenched social identity rather than a fluid political affiliation. This further erodes the moderating effects of cross-cutting cleavages, as political behavior is now driven by loyalty to in-groups rather than issue-based reasoning or democratic norms.
Ultimately, while Lipset’s theory once provided a compelling explanation for democratic stability, contemporary polarization follows a different logic, where reinforcing cleavages and identity-driven political sorting have replaced cross-cutting affiliations as the primary organizing forces in democratic conflict. Instead of reducing polarization, modern cleavages exacerbate it, leading to deeper political entrenchment, weaker democratic accountability, and greater social fragmentation.
Historically, American politics exhibited strong cross-cutting cleavages. For example, the Democratic Party once included both conservative Southern Democrats and economically progressive Northeastern liberals, while the Republican Party had both pro-business elites and socially moderate suburban voters. However, since the 1980s, partisan sorting has aligned race, religion, geography, and ideology with party affiliation, reducing ideological diversity within political coalitions (Mason, 2016). This shift has been further entrenched by the rise of hyper-partisan media, which presents political opposition in increasingly moralized and existential terms (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). Rather than moderating political behavior, the dissolution of cross-cutting media spaces has contributed to a rigid ""us vs. them"" mentality, where political identity dictates social relationships, trust networks, and even economic decisions.
The implications of this media-driven polarization are profound. The 2023 Gallup poll reveals that only one-third of Americans trust mainstream media, suggesting that individuals are increasingly consuming news from partisan or alternative sources that align with their pre-existing beliefs. This shift aligns with Graham & Svolik (2018), who argue that polarization has become so entrenched that many voters prioritize ideological loyalty over democratic norms. In this environment, even objective reporting is perceived as biased, further weakening the possibility of cross-cutting discourse. The decline of trust in media has also reinforced elite polarization, as politicians increasingly cater to fragmented and ideologically homogenous audiences, reducing incentives for compromise.
Ultimately, the U.S. case illustrates how the erosion of cross-cutting cleavages in media consumption has accelerated political polarization. Unlike Lipset’s model, where overlapping social identities diffuse conflict, modern American politics is increasingly defined by reinforcing cleavages that align ideology, identity, and media consumption into mutually exclusive camps. Unless trust in mainstream media is restored or mechanisms for cross-cutting media exposure are introduced, polarization is likely to deepen, making bipartisan cooperation and democratic stability increasingly difficult.
This suggests that Lipset’s 1959 argument—that polarization stems from the absence of cross-cutting cleavages—is outdated in an era where globalization has increased societal complexity rather than rigidified divisions. However, despite the emergence of cross-cutting cleavages, polarization remains high—pointing to a different driver of democratic instability.

Lipset’s (1959) theory of cross-cutting cleavages rests on the assumption that individuals with diverse social affiliations will act as bridges between groups, thereby reducing political polarization and fostering democratic stability. However, modern polarization no longer functions primarily through social cleavages but through ideological and affective mechanisms, reinforced by the structure of the media environment (Iyengar & Westwood, 2015). In contemporary democracies, cross-cutting social identities alone are insufficient to prevent polarization if media silos continue to isolate partisans from alternative perspectives. While past divisions—such as class or religion—intersected in ways that encouraged political moderation, today’s digital media landscape systematically reinforces ideological segregation(Lelkes et al., 2015). As a result, the key determinant of political stability is not the composition of society but the structure of media exposure, which dictates whether individuals encounter cross-cutting perspectives at all.
This shift has profound implications for how polarization should be addressed. If the problem is not that individuals lack cross-cutting social cleavages but that they are systematically shielded from cross-cutting information, the solution lies in breaking media silos rather than restructuring social groups. Simply fostering a more socially diverse electorate will not necessarily reduce polarization unless media structures actively encourage engagement with competing viewpoints. This is supported by Guess, Nyhan, & Reifler (2020), who demonstrate that mere exposure to opposing views does not always lead to greater understanding—it can, in some cases, increase political polarization as individuals react defensively when confronted with counter-attitudinal information. Thus, effective depolarization efforts must move beyond passive exposure and focus on active engagement, cognitive reflection, and deliberative media environments.
One potential intervention is News Media Literacy (NML), which seeks to equip individuals with the ability to critically evaluate media content and recognize bias (Van der Meer & Hameleers, 2020). However, media literacy alone is not a panacea. While it can mitigate selective exposure effects by improving critical thinking, research shows that individuals still rely heavily on heuristic-based judgments, where perceived credibility often overrides actual engagement with information (Guess et al., 2020). Encouraging central-route information processing, where individuals actively deliberate on content rather than accepting or rejecting it based on partisan alignment, could be a more effective approach. Bail et al. (2018) further highlight that different media environments moderate polarization differently, meaning that reforms must account for the specific ways in which social media algorithms, partisan news outlets, and digital discourse shape ideological entrenchment.
Thus, while cross-cutting cleavages remain important, they are no longer the primary mechanism for reducing polarization. A socially diverse electorate will not necessarily lead to greater political tolerance unless media environments facilitate genuine cross-cutting engagement. Future efforts to counteract polarization should focus not just on increasing exposure to alternative viewpoints but on fostering active, thoughtful engagement with competing perspectives. This requires a structural approach to media reform, one that prioritizes deliberative media platforms, improves digital literacy, and reduces the role of algorithmic echo chambers in shaping political identity."

ARGUMENT: Lipset - societies where individuals hold multiple, overlapping group memberships are less prone to extreme political conflict.
​​Cleavage Model (Lipset & Rokkan, 1967) → Classic freezing hypothesis: party systems reflect historical cleavages (e.g., class, religion, urban-rural).

LIPSET!!!!
Taylor & Rae (1969) 
Dealignment (1970s) → Weakening of traditional cleavages due to individualization, economic shifts, and declining party loyalty.
Postmaterialism (Inglehart, 1977, 1990) → Shift from materialist (economic security) to postmaterialist (self-expression, identity) values, further eroding old cleavages.

Lipset and Rokkan (1967) theorised that, during the democratisation of industrial nations in the West, voting behaviour was strongly influenced by affiliation to a social group, such as a person's social class (Clark et al. 2017). As the scholars’ “cleavage model” (1967) shows, from the 1920s voters were not necessarily engaged in rational decision-making before voting, and voting patterns have been very stable and very slow to change. Early researchers explored that in general low-class voters were more likely to vote for left-wing political parties, while high-class voters felt more aligned with right-wing parties, as the results of the British National Council elections in 1950 and 1955 reflect (Evans, 2000). The two major parties, the Conservative Party (42% in 1950 and 46% in 1955) and the Labour Party (38% in 1950 and 48% in 1955), consistently drew voters from smaller parties. The upper-middle class felt more and more a sense of belonging towards The Conservative Party, values and policies, while the working-class population strongly identified with the Labour Party's economic and social interests (Evans and Tilley, 2011). However, subsequent research by Evans (2000) and Dalton (1984) has shown that during the '60s and the ‘70s, a general increase in economic growth and higher education within working and middle-class groups weakened the link between social class and voting behaviour; as voters ability to make electoral decisions that are calculative and issue-oriented increased, preferences where less driven by collective identities. Moreover, Inglehart (1971) observed that post-war generations had grown up in a time of relative prosperity and peace. Their material needs had been met and voters no longer had to worry about economic survival, therefore did not vote for the party that best fit their social class but rather focused on post-materialistic values such as self-fulfilment, freedom and morality.  As a result, the lower and middle classes were more dedicated to their principles and social values, and their political preferences were based on individual issues and concerns rather than social class membership (Inglehart, 1971).



Realignment? Today’s Cleavage Model. The question is whether we are witnessing a realignment of cleavages rather than just dealignment.
New cleavages have emerged, such as the cultural divide (liberal cosmopolitans vs. conservative nationalists) and economic globalization vs. protectionism. -> We argue, however, that in today’s world, additional important cleavages underlie contemporary polarization not easily measured with the Left–Right ideological scale: globalist/cosmopolitan versus nationalist; religious versus secular; urban versus rural; traditional versus modern cultural values; and participatory versus representative dem- ocratic models. (McCoy et al., 2018) 
Some argue that instead of the old class-religion cleavages, we now have an emerging populist vs. establishment divide.
Cross-cutting cleavages occur when different social divisions do not align perfectly. For example, an individual might be ethnically minority but economically privileged, or religiously conservative but politically liberal.
Reinforcing cleavages, on the other hand, occur when social divisions align in a way that deepens polarization. For example, if all members of a certain ethnicity also belong to a single economic class and political party, the divisions become harder to bridge, increasing societal tension
Selway, (2011)
→ actually we’ve moved to identity based cleavages : 
Lipset (1959) argued that cross-cutting cleavages reduce polarization because individuals with overlapping group memberships (e.g., religious but economically progressive, or urban but socially conservative) act as bridges between factions, softening political divisions. However, McCoy et al. (2018) argue that modern polarization does not follow this logic. Instead of multiple cleavages acting as a moderating force, contemporary polarization consolidates various divisions (economic, cultural, religious, geographic) into a single dominant cleavage—for instance, ""cosmopolitan vs. nationalist"" or ""populist vs. establishment""—which overrides cross-cutting influences.
Historically, American politics had strong cross-cutting cleavages (e.g., Southern Democrats who were conservative on race but liberal on economics).
Today, McCoy et al. (2018) show that political identity has become a social identity—where even social relationships, workplaces, and neighborhoods are shaped by partisan divisions.
This aligns with Iyengar & Westwood (2015) on affective polarization, where Republicans and Democrats increasingly see each other not as opponents, but as existential threats.

"what is the main thesis?: 
According to research on ‘the end of cleavage politics’ (REF) parties and their electorates have changed in contemporary democracies. Mass based parties have been replaced by electoral/cartel parties while voters have become more independent from traditional forms of group allegiances. This revisionist interpretation challenges a longstanding tradition which regards class, religion and territory as the basis for the ‘insulation’ (Lipset and Rokkan, 1967) of voters in opposing camps brought about by parties, through a kind of social closure (Bartolini and Mair, 1990) which, mainly in Western Europe, eventually led to the “encapsulation’ (Bartolini, 2000) of voters in distinct political enclaves and sub-cultures.
To be sure, the empirical veracity of this diagnosis on the decline of cleavage politics is still a matter of debate (Evans, 1999) but, more importantly, no shared consensus exists on the causal mechanisms underpinning and conditioning this process. Previous research on the decline of social cleavages in western party systems has tended to fall into one of two camps: those that privilege social structural factors and those that emphasise political issues. The former - which have dominated the literature - highlights the primacy of changes in the social composition of the electorate, and can be considered a ‘bottom-up’ approach to the structuring of political divisions. The latter, by contrast argues that cleavage allegiances derives from the strategies of parties themselves, and can be characterized as ‘top-down’ in nature. The bottom up approach argues that changes that have occurred within the electorate, such as rising living standards and the spread of affluence (Kitschelt 1994) and the expansion of higher education have increased the cognitive capacity of voters and undermined the salience of group identities, making voters more individualistic, secular and rational (Franklin 1985, 1992). This ‘modernisation thesis’ therefore posits that there has been gradual erosion in the political salience of social cleavages over time (much like social change itself has been gradual). By contrast, the top down approach has tended to focus on elite mobilisation strategies, and according to this approach the electoral salience of traditional cleavages is a response to changes in the supply side of party policies (Sartori, 1969).
With respect to social class, there is a substantial literature relating class voting to left-right policy preferences (Lipset 1954). The working class prefer redistribution and so vote for parties on the left, whereas the middle class try to resist these claims and so vote for parties on the right. Accordingly, the degree to which parties differ in their economic policies in this regard is thought to influence the degree to which different classes support them. This assumption provides the backbone for studies which seek to explain class voting in relation to party positions. Accordingly if parties differ in their policy outlook along dimensions strongly related to the cleavages we would expect the salience, or strength of these cleavages to be stronger than if the parties stand for much the same policy outlook (Oskarson 2005: 103). This perspective recognises the autonomous role of parties as main players in attenuating or reinforcing traditional cleavages. Although empirical tests of this hypothesis have provided mixed results (see Niewbeerta) evidence that class voting is higher when there is a clear policy difference between the parties has been found in the UK (Evans, Heath, Payne, 1999), Italy (Bellucci, 2001, 2002) and Northern Europe (Oskarson, 2005).
With respect to religion – which has received somewhat less attention in the comparative research literature –, its ostensibly diminishing impact on voting seems to impinge not so much upon the increasing secularization at the mass level, as on the relevance of political agency, that is the role played by religious secondary organization in society and its links to party politics (Broughton and ten Napel, 2000; Bellucci, Maraffi, Segatti, 2007).
Although these top-down and bottom-up approaches are often considered to be competing, this is largely because there has been a considerable amount of controversy over whether the impact of social cleavages has in fact declined or not (see Evans, 1999 for a summary). Accordingly, those that argue that there has been a gradual long term decline in class voting emphasise sociological explanations of change (which have also been gradual), while those who argue that there have been trendless fluctuations emphasise political explanations to do with the polarisation of the policy space (which also goes up and down). At a theoretical level both approaches tap into important aspects of social cleavage theory (group identity and political articulation), and potentially can have independent effects on the strength of social cleaves in party systems.
However, a crucial aspect of social cleavage theory has hitherto been ignored. By far, and surprisingly, the least attention has been devoted to the third element in the notion of a cleavage, which refers to the linkage between parties and organized society, or ‘segmentation’. The capability of parties to penetrate organizations, or to create parallel organizations, has been a key factor in reinforcing group identity and interest representation, so as to strengthen and perpetuate cleavage segmentation (REF). Indeed, Mair (REF) argues that there is nothing ‘natural’ or predetermined about the working class supporting parties of the left, but rather it is a historical result of Union penetration in leftist parties, thus creating a link between group identity and political support.
According to Rokkan (1977: 565), segmentation is the ‘degree of interlocking between cleavage specific organisations active in the corporate channel and party organisations mobilising for electoral support’. Research addressing this aspect has, however, focussed on the organisational density of union or religious associations in society at large rather than in political parties in particular (Bartolini and Mair 1990: 231; Nieuwbeerta and Ultee 1999). These accounts are, again, more society driven, and are of the bottom up variety, thus failing to adequately address the core concept. Indeed, as examples from Latin America show, high levels of unionisation need not necessarily translate in to high levels of class voting. What is important, is the penetration of these organisation in political parties rather than just in society.
We argue that the linkage between parties and social organisations constitutes a critical part of the process in translating membership in a social group into support for a political party. This implies that models which fail to take this into account are seriously underspecified. Moreover, the structure of these linkages, in particular whether they create reinforcing or cross-cutting pressures on voters, also conditions the impact of party attempts to mobilise social groups though policy platforms.
By modelling the structure of linkages between parties and organisations we build on Sniderman and Bullucks’s (2004: 338) notion of consistency theory and argue that the impact of policy polarisation is conditional not only on the characteristics of the chooser (the voter) but also on the characteristics of the choice (the parties). When the characteristics of individual voters are consistent with the characteristics of the choice (political parties) then party efforts to mobilise issues re-inforce voter preferences, making them more likely to select the policy alternative that is congruent with their general view of the matter (Sniderman and Theriault 2004: 347). By contrast, when the characteristics of the choosers are inconsistent with the characteristics of the choice (that is voters face cross-cutting pressures at the organisational level) party efforts to mobilise issues face resistance, and are therefore not so successful. Failure to take these linkages into account in the specification of prior models may explain why previous research has provided only mixed results in support of the polarisation hypothesis.
The Italian dual cleavage system offers a clear opportunity to test these hypotheses, since voters – as Table 1 shows – are exposed to different possible influences of cleavages. The impact of cleavages on voting depends then both on voters’s location in the dual cleavage system and on the configuration of party-association linkages. Cleavages may therefore either reinforce each other in channelling voting or their impact be attenuated by their crosscutting. The extent to which also parties’ links with organized society show an overlapping or a cross-cutting structure becomes then the crucial variable explaining cleavage voting and an intervening variable conditioning the impact of party mobilisation of issues."

T�s book examines the relation between capitalism and democracy or, more �rec ely, between the transfonnations of society that came with capitalist ep:inomic development and the long-term chances of democratic forms of rule. ewill review past research, offer a new theoretical framework that can � coJlnt for the apparent contradictions of earlier findings, and put the framework to the test in three sets of broad historical comparisons - of the ��v ced capitalist countries, of Latin America, and of Central America and e Caribbean islands.
/: That capitalism and democracy go hand in hand is a widely held belief. J�deed it is a commonplace of western political discourse. Editorials and p�litical pronouncements insist regularly that capitalist develop­ ent - economic development driven by capital interests in competition with �ach other - will also bring about political freedom and democratic participa­ ohin government. In fact, democracy and capitalism are often seen as virtually
identical.
\The East-West confrontation gave this proposition a special quality of proud �ssertiveness. And the downfall of the state socialist regimes of eastern Europe �s celebrated by many as the final proof. Ironically, a quite similar proposition central to the views of Lenin, though he gave it a very different slant. ""Bourgeois democracy"" was for him the constitutional form that perfectly fits .the. capitalist economic order. But in this view capitalism and democracy go handin hand because democracy, while proclaiming the rule of the many, in fact protects the interests of capital owners. Whatever their differences in the 9 ncep on and valuation of democracy, both these views share an important da. : the unrestrained operation of the market for capital and labor constitutes tlie material base of democracy. Democracy is the characteristic political form of capitalism.
The classics of nineteenth-century political theory also tended toward the yiew that the transformations wrought by capitalist development would bring :gemocracy. But their reactions to this prospect were very different from what one might expect knowing the thought of their twentieth-century heirs. Ale�� de Tocqueville and John Stuart Mill were apprehensive about full-fledge4t democracy, and they were not alone in this. Their fear of ""false democra �€ (Mill) and of the ""tyranny of the majority"" (de TocquevilIe) expressed �.0 anticipations of many Liberals and bourgeois conservatives of the time. By� contrast, at the left of the political spectrum Marx opted for full democracy an� ; saw in universal suffrage a major step in the transition from capitalis t � socialism.His""dictatorshipoftheproletariat""wasnotsoverydifferentfro d$� Tocqueville's ""tyranny of the majority,"" except that for Marx this was. a vision6�j hope while for de Tocqueville it was one of disaster.
tm These reactions give us a first sense that· the questions surro mding #�
relationship between capitalism and democracy may be more cOlnplex a�$ current orthodoxies allow. Actually, the twentieth century has made this eve�f more clear than it was already in the nineteenth. Our century offers y;� examples of capitalist political economies that prospered without democra �� many were in fact ruled by harshly authoritarian political regimes. South Kor��� and Taiwan after World War II come to mind as well as, in recent decades� such Latin American countries as Brazil and Chile. And even Nazi Germ yl: and the various Fascist regimes in Europe between the two Word Wars do nQtl exhaust the list. On the other hand, virtually all full-fledged democracies w�� know are associated with capitalist political economies, and virtually all ai�� creatures of the twentieth century. If this is the century of repressive regimes;' vastly more burdensome than any known in history, it is also the century oh' democracy.
 Even a cursory review of history suggests some generalizations that point t9. an association between capitalist development and democracy but do not settle! the question.

To this one must add immediately that government in the agrarian societieS

'\�\�;In chapter 2, after describing and evaluating the two research traditions, we \> evelop a methodological approach which, when combined with the theoretical ':ideas',developed in chapter 3, promises to transcend the impasse. In the YQllo ng three chapters, we put these ideas to the test in fresh analyses of the 'U;�omplex evidence. Based on an integrated theoretical and methodological
{framework, we present our own comparative historical investigations of a large
""
;""nit'mber of Cases. These will, we submit, resolve the controversy about the \��la onship between development and democracy. And since this controversy < s been at the center of empirical democracy research, our study will do more than merely resolve an esoteric scholarly debate; it will throw new light on the major conditions favoring and inhibiting democracy.
We are convinced that the main fmding of the cross-national statistical work - a positive, though not perfect, correlation between capitalist develop­ ment and democracy - must stand as an accepted result. There is no way of explaining this robust finding, replicated in many studies of different design, as the spurious effect of flawed methods. Any theory of democracy must come to terms with it. At the same time, such a correlation, no matter how often replicated, does not carry its own explanation. It does not identify the causal sequences accounting for the persistent relation, not to mention the reasons why many cases are at odds with it. Nor can it account for how the samf end can be reached by different historical routes. The repeated statistical fmd ng has a peculiar ""black box"" character that can be overcome only by theoretically well grounded empirical analysis.
Comparative historical studies, we argue, carry the best promise of shedding light into the black box. This is not only because comparative historical work has been particularly rich in theoretical argument. Far more important, historical research gives insight into sequences and their relations to surrounding structural conditions, and that is indispensable for developing valid causal accounts. Causal analysis is inherently sequence analysis.
At the same time, comparative historical research is able to go beyond conventional history's preoccupation with historical particularity and aim for theoretical generalization. Analytically oriented comparative history builds on a series of case analyses. It seeks to establish satisfactory explanatory accounts that do justice to each case and at the same time are theoretically coherent and consistent with each other. In the process it develops a body of theorems of proven explanatory power.
Such comparative historical case analysis must be guided from the beginning by a framework of theoretical ideas. Without that, the analysis lacks orientation in the face of an endless multitude of possibly relevant facts. The framework which we develop in chapter 3 builds on past research, it informs the accounts of individual cases and gives them theoretical unity and coherence, yet it is in turn subject to revisions suggested by the case analyses.
A framework of theoretical concepts and propositions also mitigates another problem that haunts the comparative historical study of large-scale pheno� mena - the fact that only a limited number of cases can be studied in the required detail. We tackle this problem directly by stretching the scope of our own investigations to the limit. We analyze a large number of cases, close to the universe in the three groups of countries selected, and we trace their development over relatively long periods of time. In fact, our comparative historical studies include more Cases than quite a few cross-national statistical studies. Yet the cases are still too few in number to allow, by themselves, secure analytic conclusions. For this there are too many possibly relevant factors and too complex interrelations among them. It is here that a carefully built theoretical framework makes a critical contribution. It represents in an important sense the fmdings of a vast body of previous work, and it thus enlarges the reach and validity of the analysis substantially.
  Our theoretical framework incorporates the major findings of the cross­ national quantitative studies. However, we depart from the theoretical under­ pinnings of much of the cross-national statistical work, which often adopted the then current models of modernization theory. In this structural-functional conception of social order, society, polity, and economy are seen as more or less \'{ell-functioning systems integrated primarily by shared values and cultural Rremises. Democracy arises due to its functional fit with the advanced industrial economy. To the extent that the development of democracy is attributed to an agent, as in Upset's (1959) classic article, it is the middle class
that is seen as the primary promoter of democracy. The upper-class, and especially the lower class, are seen as the enemies of democracy.
,13Y contrast, we employ, like most of the comparative historical work from Max Weber to Guillermo O'Donnell, a ""political economy"" perspective that focuses on actors - individual as well as collective actors - whose power is grounded i n control o f economic and organizational resources andlor of c::oercive force and who vie with each other for scarce resources in the pursuit of c::clUflicting goals. While such a perspective does recognize the role of ideas, values and non-material interests, especially when they are grounded in institutions and collective organization, it differs sharply from the functionalist
llIld culture-centered premises of modernization theory.
. How, then, do we conceive of democracy and its conditions? Our most basic
premise is that democracy is above all a matter of power. Democratization r�presents first and foremost an increase in political equality. This idea is the ground upon which aU of our work stands. The central proposition of our theo. retical argument virtually follows from this: it is power relations that most importantly determine whether democracy can emerge, stabilize, and then
maintain itself even in the face of adverse conditions.
"" There is first the balance of power among different classesandclasscoalitions.
This is a factor of overwhelming importance. It is complemented by two other power configurations - the structure, strength, and autonomy of the state apparatus and its interrelations with civil society and the impact of transnational
  on both the balance of class power and on state-society relations. focus on class and class coalitions may be surprising to some, while it is perhaps too easily accepted by others. We emphasize social class, first, because the concept is in our view a master key to understanding the social structuring ofinterests and power in society, and second, because the organization of class m,terests is constitutive of major collective actors. The organization of class interests is, however, a complex process in which not only the forms of c.ollective action but the very interests actually pursued are socially and historically constructed. Thus, the subjective understanding and political p()sture ofclass actors cannot be read off the underlying class structure in any
one-to-one fashion.
•. None the less, the political postures of given classes are not infinitely variable
either. Based on our theoretical understanding and past historical and sociolo­ gical research, we expected classes to exhibit definite central political tenden­ cJes:in the struggle for political democracy. One central axis was defined by what benefits and losses classes could expect from extensions of political inclusion; the other was the class's ability to organize itself and engage in collective action in defense of class interests. This led us to the hypothesis, following Barrington Moore, that large landlords engaged in ""labor repressive"" agriculture would be the most implacable opponents of democracy. However, in contrast to Moore, as well as to Leninists and liberal social scientists, we also expected the bourgeoisie2 to oppose suffrage extension to the working classes as such a move posed a potential treat to their interests. We expected the urban working class to be the most frequent proponent of the full extension of democratic rights because this promised to include the class in the polity where it could further pursue its interests and because the working class, unli! .e other lower classes, had the capacity to organize itself. It is the capacity to ',rganize and express its interests that differentiated the working class from t Ie small peasantry. We hypothesized that the middle classes would favor their own inclusion, but would be ambivalent about further extensions of political rights, perhaps swinging to one side or another on the basis of possible alliances.

Class power is in our view intimately related to the development of, the increasing organizational density of, civil society. This proposition seems at first glance similar to - but in reality is quite distinct from - claims of modernization theorists and pluralists that the growth of intermediate groups and associations tends to be supportive of democracy. Civil society, in our conception, is the totality of social institutions and associations, both formal and informal, that are not strictly production-related nor governmental or familial in character. Capitalist development furthers the growth of civil society - by increasing the level of urbanization, by bringing workers together in factories, by improving the means of communication and transportation, by raising the level of literacy. Strengthening the organization and organizational capacity of the working and middle classes serves to empower those classes and thus to change the balance of class powerj A dense civil society also has an importance for democracy on its own, because it establishes a counterweight to state power.
In modern societies the state - the set of organizations involved in making and implementing binding collective decisions, if necessary by force - is invariably one major component of the overall landscape of power in society. There is no contemporary society in which the structure of domination can simply be understood by looking at the distribution of economic and social power in civil society. And the state is in varying degrees set -.Off from and independent of other power centers. Since the state is not only an apparatus of implementation and enforcement but also the arena in which binding collective
decisions are arrived at, it is of obvious importance to an understanding of the conditions of democracy. The shape of state structures and their relations to other power concentrations are therefore a second cluster of conditions shaping the chances of democracy.
- A third cluster of conditions is constituted by transnational power relations. Obviously, power relations do not stop at the borders of politically organized societies. States stand in close interaction with power centers beyond their  One critical aspect of all three clusters of power, as ,well as of their

interrelations, is the fact that social patterns, once forged, often persist beyond their original conditions. This negates the possibility of a ""presentist"" explana­ tion of democracy, one that involves only factors observably active in the present momentofhistory, and it voids any mechanical account of the impact of class, state, and transnational power on constitutional form. Here is another powerful rationale for engaging in comparative historical analysis, which can take such persistencies into account and respond sensitively to alternative paths of causation.
 Our own comparative investigations not only cover a very large number of cases in historical depth but also focus on the areas of the world most important for the history of democratization. We first turn to the advanced capitalist countries focusing on how democracy was first fully established as well as how democratic rule subsequentlty fared in the critical period between the two World Wars. We secondly study the complex processes of democratiza­ tion - often only partial democratization - and of reversals of democratic rule in the countries of Latin America. Thirdly, we compare the countries of Central America with the island societies of the Caribbean. The whole set of cases
, ••
examined represents the areas with the most extensive democratic experience. At the same time, there are many examples of stable non-democratic regimes as well as,of breakdowns of democratic political systems that can be analyzed comparatively side by side with instances of democratization and stable democratic rule, giving ample opportunity to use the analytical comparative historical method to the fullest extent.
'What is the upshot of our analyses? First, it is not an overall structural correspondence between capitalism and democracy that explains the rise and persistence of democracy. Some have conceived of such a correspondence as a simple mutual reinforcement between a free market for goods and services and a.market for political outcomes. Others (as for instance Cutright 1963) have seen democracy more diffusely as a highly ""differentiated"" political form that fits,the more differentiated social structures produced by capitalist develop­ ment. Our analyses do not lend support to such overall correspondence propositions. Neither do they confirm the view of the bourgeoisie as the main agent of democracy that has been central to both classic liberal and marx­ ist-leninist theory. Rather - we conclude - capitalist development is associated
democracy because it transforms the class structure, strengthening the working and middle classes and weakening the landed upper class. It was not the capitalist market nor capitalists as the new dominant force, but rather the contradictions of capitalism that advanced the cause of democracy. A brief summary of our main findings should help to prepare and guide th� reader through the theoretical arguments and the historical evidence presente4 in the following chapters. We found that social classes behaved in a quite systematic manner across our historical cases and in accordance with ou� expectations. The working class was the most consistently pro-democratic force. The class had a strong interest in effecting its political inclusion and it was more insulated from the hegemony of dominant classes than the rural lower classes. Exceptions to the pro-democratic posture of the working class occurred where the class was initially mobilized by a charismatic but authoritarian leade� or a hegemonic party linked to the state apparatus. !i
The landed upper-classes which were dependent on a large suppJ y of cheap labor were the most consistently anti-democratic force. DemocraLization for them posed the possibility oflosing this labor supply. The bourgeoisie we found to be generally supportive ofthe installation ofconstitutional and representativ¢ government, but opposed to extending political inclusion to the lower classes: For the landed classes as well as the' bourgeoisie threat perception was. important both at the time of the initial installation of democratic rule and for i� later consolidation. If these classes felt acutely threatened in their vital interests by popular pressures, they invariably opposed democracy and, once democratic
rule was installed, attempted to undermine it.
The middle classes played an ambiguous role in the installation and
consolidation of democracy. They pushed for their own inclusion but their attitude towards inclusion of the lower classes depended on the need and possibilities for an alliance with the working class. The middle classes wer¢ most in favor of full democracy where they were confronted with intransigerit dominant classes and had the option of allying with a sizeable working classi However, if they started feeling threatened by popular pressures under'a democratic regime, they turned to support the imposition of an authoritarian
alternative.
The peasantry and rural workers also played varied roles, depending on their
capacity for autonomous organization and their susceptibility to the influence 01 the dominant classes. Independent family farmers in small-holding countries were a pro-democratic force, whereas their posture in countries or areas dominated by large landholdings was more authoritarian. Peasants living on large estates remained by and large unmobilized and thus did not play a role in democratization. Rural wage workers on plantations did attempt to organize; and where they were not repressed, they joined other working-class organiza7 tions in pushing for political inclusion.
As anticipated, we did observe systematic variation across regions in the class structure and therefore in class alliances and the dynamics ofdemocratization. Most importantly, the working-class was smaller and weaker and the landed class stronger in Latin America and the Caribbean, which made for a balance 01 class power less favorable for democratization than in the core countries; Due
to the relative weakness of the working class, the middle classes played here the leading role in pushing for democratization, with the result that democraCJ often remained restricted.

teristics aided or impeded the development of democracy.
One last issue has to be taken up in this brief introduction to the problems we intend to pursue. The concept of democracy has been given very different meanings. Clarifying one's conception of ""democracy"" is not just a question of finding an adequate and precise operational definition. Rather it involves more complex issues of meaning. The marxist critique of ""bourgeois democracy"" raises perhaps the 'most central issue: is the claim of democracy to constitute the rule of the many real, or is this claim a sham that makes the de facto T' lie ofthe f e w m o r e e f f e c ti v e a n d s e c u r e b e h i n d a s c r e e n o f f o r m al yl d , : m o c r a ti c institutions? To anticipate our position and put it with apodictic b:evity:no actually existing democracy can claim to constitute in a realistic sense the rule of the many; but ""bourgeois"" or formal democracy does make a differenceJol' the process of political decision-making and for the outcomes of that process.
This position has methodological consequences. The concepts of democracy used in our research - as well as in virtually all other empirical studies - aim to . identifY the really existing democracies of our world and to distinguish them from other forms of rule. Our operating concepts are therefore not based onthe most far-reaching ideals of democratic thought - of a government thoroughly and equally responsive to the preferences of all its citizens (Dahl 1971) or ofa polity in which human beings fulfill themselves through equal and active participation in collective self-rule (Macpherson 1973). Rather, they orient
themselves to the more modest forms of popular participation in government through representative parliaments that appear as r.ealistic possibilities in the complex societies of today. Our definitions of democracy focus on the state's responsibility to parliament (possibly complemented by direct election ofthe head of the executive), on regular free and fair elections, on the freedom of expression and association, and on the extent of the suffrage. Robert Dahl, whose careful conceptualizations probably had the greatest influence.on empirical democracy research, reserved the term ""polyarchy"" for this more modest and inevitably somewhat formal version of democracy (Dahl 1956, 1971).
Why do we care about formal democracy if it considerably falls short ofthe actual rule of the many? This question assumes particular saliency in the light of two of our fmdings, namely that democracy was a result of the contradictions of capitalist development and that it could be consolidated only if the interests of the capitalist classes were not directly threatened by it. The full answer to �s question will become clear as we proceed with our analysis. But it is possible to anticipate our conclusion briefly already here. We care about formal democracy because it tends to be more than merely formal. It tends to be real to some extent. Giving the many a real voice in the formal collective decision-making of a country is the most promising basis for further progress in the distribution of power and other forms of substantive equality. The same factors which support the installation and consolidation of formal democracy, namely growth in th"
"as an international political theory expert, explain this in detail. do it in a discoursive way following the authors train, clearly marking all the theories and theorists presented/cited, emphasising these three points discuss arguments for and against the militarisation thesis
• examine the global and colonial roots of carceral violence
• critically reflect on abolitionist frameworks and their relevance for global justice.: In IR, debates about racialised state violence have predominantly been framed through the lens of police militarisation. Some scholars argue
that the last few years have seen the ‘militarisation’ of domestic policing, especially in the USA. Brutal strategies, weaponry and technologies first used in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – including body armour, drones, SWAT vehicles, toxic chemicals, military aircrafts and machine guns – have been incorporated into domestic policing. The result has been a process whereby the war has come ‘home’.
In response, some critics have argued that the militarisation thesis relies on a false distinction between the police and the military, in which the police is seen as a non-violent and domestic institution that is tasked with maintaining order, whereas the military is understood as operating in the international sphere with the goal of defeating the enemy, often through the use of violence. As Alison Howell (2018, p.120; see also Neocleous, 2014) argues, this overlooks that ‘those ‘civilian’ things that are claimed to be in danger of ‘militarisation’ have much deeper roots in warfare... and colonial violence.’ The idea that the police has undergone a process of militarisation rests on the myth of a ‘golden age’ in which the divisions between the police and military, war and peace, and domestic and international spheres were clearly distinguishable. As McMichael (2016, p.119) explains, this is anchored in the assumption that ‘the military [i]
s an institution solely for foreign policy and the ‘over there’ and the police
   80 [i]s a domestic institution only deployed ‘here’ for law enforcement and keeping the peace.’
For critics, this not only obscures that the distinction between policing and warfare was always blurred in the colonial context; for example, colonial (so called ‘small’) wars were historically seen, not as wars per se, but as insurgencies and acts of criminality that were to be crushed using police power. Moreover, it also obfuscates that the police has never been civilian or local: as Tamara Nopper and Mariame Kaba (2014) argue, for brown, black and indigenous minorities in the USA ‘the ‘war on terror’ hasn’t come home. It’s always been here’.
In summary, for these critics the idea that police and military belong to distinct geographies (domestic versus international) and have their own separate logics (establishing order versus defeating the enemy) is a myth. Police, they thus argue, has not recently been militarised: rather, police and military are interconnected parts of the same modality of state violence. In challenging the militarisation thesis, IR theorists have begun to unearth the global and colonial origins of what is often regarded as domestic forms of state violence. Drawing on Aimé Césaire’s notion of the ‘boomerang’ (see Chapter 11), scholars have shown how colonial war zones frequently functioned as ‘social laboratories’ where new techniques of control could be tested before they were shipped back to the metropole (for a good summary of the boomerang thesis, see Koram, 2022). The French Empire regularly used Algeria as a testing ground for forms of population control that later were exported back to the colonial metropolis; the USA relied
on the Philippines to experiment with new forms of policing tactics; and Britain made use of its domestic colony, Ireland, and later Palestine, Malaya, Cyprus and Kenya. These methods and strategies not only ‘boomeranged’ back to the metropole, but they often circulated between different colonies; often with certain focal points as origins or nodes of transmission, such as Palestine or Ireland (see Khalili, 2010).
Recent scholarship by Laleh Khalili (2012) and Stuart Schrader (2019) underscores the role of the colonial boomerang in contemporary policing practices. Khalili examines the distinctively colonial roots of counterinsurgency strategies and tactics used in the war on terror. She argues that contemporary forms of confinement and detention were first developed during the colonial occupation of Algeria, India and Palestine. Schrader, meanwhile, takes inspiration from the work of black radicals such as George Jackson, who in the 1960s described policing
as ‘internal colonisation’ (see also Trafford, 2020). For Schrader, the expansion of incarceration and policing in the USA in this period needs
to be understood within the wider context of the USA’s global war on communism. Just as (neo)colonial technologies and techniques have often ‘boomeranged’ back home, so domestic policing methods have frequently served as models for counterinsurgency tactics and operations abroad. As Schrader explains, USA imperial hegemony in the post-1945 world took shape, first and foremost, as a global police project. From Indonesia to
Chapter 16: Empire at home: from civil rights to Black Lives Matter
  81 Nicaragua, the USA projected its power by training, arming and deploying local police forces with the goal of crushing communist insurgencies
and repressing dissidents. As such, the ‘war on crime’ at home cannot be understood in isolation from this ‘war on communism’ abroad. Indeed, mass incarceration developed ‘specifically in the context of an effort to use police to manage global decolonisation’ (Schrader, 2019, p.5).
More generally, other thinkers have put forth a variety of conceptual frameworks that seek to transcend the domestic/international and peace/ war dichotomies, which they argue conceal the transnational nature of state violence. Howell (2018, p.121) proposes the concept of ‘martial politics’ to capture ‘the process by which war and peace are imbricated’ and enacted on racialised, indigenous, disabled and queer populations. Schrader (2019) prefers instead the ‘police-military continuum’ whereas Manchanda and Rossdale (2021) draw on Huey Netwon’s theory
of intercommunalism. Ultimately, these scholars see policing and incarceration as historical and ongoing practices of colonisation and racialisation on a global scale. Viewed from this perspective, the world is structured not so much through territorial state sovereignty as by what W.E.B. Du Bois called a global ‘colour line’ (see Chapter 9; also Anievas et al., 2015).
 In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement, the concept of police and prison abolition has entered public debate (for an excellent summary, see McLeod, 2019). Abolition is often contrasted with more liberal approaches centered around struggles for civil rights and legal recognition. That is, the goal is not to create a more ‘just’ and less racist criminal justice system, but to abolish it altogether. Many abolitionists are careful to frame this as a simultaneously destructive and constructive project. As the black radical thinker Angela Davis summarises:
‘When I refer to prison abolitionism, I like to draw from the DuBoisian notion of abolition democracy. That is to say, it is not only, or not even primarily, about abolition as a negative process of tearing down, but it is also about building up, about creating new institutions. Although Du Bois referred very specifically to slavery and its legal disestablishment as an economic institution, his observation that this negative process by itself was insufficient has deep resonances for prison abolition today. DuBois pointed out that in order to fully abolish the oppressive conditions produced by slavery, new democratic institutions would have to be created’ (Davis, 2005, p.73; see also Gilmore, 2022).
In other words, abolition is both a negative project of dismantling violent structures, as well as a generative project of building new democratic institutions. While most of the existing abolitionist literature has focused on the domestic realm (and especially on the USA), George Lipsitz (2004) argues that abolition is an inherently global project. As he explains, ‘any anti-racist struggle has to be transnational as well as national, inter-ethnic as well as pan-ethnic’ (Lipsitz, 2004, p.282). This is because ‘The empire is ‘in here’ as well as ‘out there’. White supremacy is a global as well as a national project’ (ibid). Recent scholarship in IR have built on this idea (see, for example, Axster, 2021; Manchanda and Rossdale, 2021)."

"what is the main thesis? : Over the last few years, an emergent body of International Relations scholarship has taken an interest in the rise of global cities and the challenges they bring to existing geographies of power. In this article, I argue that a focus on race and empire should be central to this literature. Using the Grenfell Tower !re in London as a starting point, the article shows that global cities are part of a historical and ongoing imperial terrain. From London to New York, São Paulo to Cape Town, Singapore to Cairo, the ‘making’ of global cities has typically gone hand in hand with racialized forms of displacement, dispossession and police violence. Drawing on the literature on racial capitalism, as well as Aimé Césaire’s image of the ‘boomerang’, I show that these strategies build on practices of urban planning, slum administration and law-and-order policing long experimented with in the (post)colonies. By examining the colonial dimensions of what many assume to be a strictly national problem for the welfare state, the article thus reveals global cities as part of a much wider cartography of imperial and racial violence. This not only calls into question the presentism of scholarship that highlights the ‘newness’ of neoliberal urbanism. In demonstrating how global cities and colonial borderlands are bound together through racial capitalism, it also exposes the positionality of scholars and policymakers that seek to counter the violence of neoliberalism with a nostalgic return to the post-1945 welfare state. As the Grenfell !re revealed, the global city is less a new type of international actor or governance structure than an extension and recon!guration of the domestic space of empire."

"can you help me to develop what Paul Kelly's response would be to Ida Danewid thinking? Please find below some of the main points of Danewid's thinking: academia always reflects people’s biases
state is not neutral arbiter of justice that can or should be appealed to for rights, recognition, restitution, rather it is relation of violence that is central to upholding and entrenching racial capitalism across the world -> that is why the state must be abolished
state developed out of racism and capitalism -> why state is problematic -> we need to move beyond it 
»from start, state and capital existed in symbiosis, with race as their lifeblood« 
how they are related: capitalism cannot live without (racial) violence justified through racial and colonial hierarchies -> violence works best when there is race involved -> racial capitalism needs violence and state delivers this 
techniques of state violence: police, environmental, gender base
Development of state:
feudal system -> socialist anti-feudal uprisings in late medieval period causing breakdown of authority -> violent counter-revolution from above coming up with idea of centralized capitalist state to suppress lower classes
beforehand race not big thing -> as tool of suppression it then became relevant -> making of radicalized order by suppression of Jews, Sinti and Roma, Muslims and not yet black people -> justifying violence of state by their suppression, that is why we need violence
with 1492 discovery of America it was then extended globally through colonial conquest 
birth of the state also saw the birth of the political paradigm: an antidemocratic and hierarchical vision of society centered around the question of how to be governed -> Western political theory has come to associate politics with rulership, sovereignty, hierarchy, and ultimately the state
popularity of Hobbes and his state centric view is because the state is so popular and so active -> »proto fascist« 
the political: the state: racial capitalism: antidemocratic and hierarchical: bad
the anti political: the real solution unlike the Left/right spectrum and Western political thought suggest utopia -> ending state governance

Global cities are part of historical and ongoing imperial terrain 
These cities have been created by racialized displacement, dispossession and police violence 
London is not a neutral space -> it is an imperial project where racism, colonialism and capitalism work together to create inequality and neglect 

Capitalism is racial and relies on exploitation dispossession and inequalities based on race 
Global cities like london are built on these principles where non white communities are systematically marginalised 

Migrant crisis result of racialized world order collapsing and another struggling to be born -> swing to the right is not reflection of the crisis but a response to it 
Moral panic surrounding migration indicative of underlying crisis in racial hegemony
Moral panics around migration is used to defend whiteness - maintain social control and manage all the contradictions of neoliberal capitalism"

"as a foreign policy analysis expert, explain this: For many foreign policy analysis (FPA) scholars, the most significant source of foreign policy is found in the nature and structure of the
state itself. According to Thomas Risse-Kappen (1995), the importance
of the structure of state resides in the fact that it is the crucial site of foreign policy decision-making and, as mediated through constitutional arrangements, the area where state and society ‘negotiate’ the country’s International Relations (IR). Here, within the particular constitutional framework of each state, domestic institutions and interest groups operate, devising coalition-building strategies that ultimately demonstrate the effectiveness of domestic influences over foreign policy. The rules
of political participation also influence formal politics and the conduct
of political parties when it comes to international issues. Traditionally,
the executive is accorded the right to formulate and implement foreign policy, either because of the constitution or through convention, with the legislature and other institutions having only limited powers of judicial review and control over the budget. The number of points of access between societal groups and decision-makers determines the degree to which a state’s foreign policy is the product of public input. For example, France with few access points to the executive is ‘state- dominated’, as the public has only a limited role in foreign policy, while the United States with multiple access points to the executive is ‘society-dominated’, and the public has more opportunities to influence foreign policy.
Another aspect of domestic structure that influences foreign policy is
that of political regime type. Authoritarian regimes, lacking an electoral mandate from their population, have historically used foreign issues
as a distraction from domestic difficulties. George Kennan’s (1947) ‘X telegram’ and subsequent articulation of America’s ‘containment policy’
of the Soviet Union was predicated on this form of analysis of the roots
of Soviet foreign policy. From this perspective, democratic (or ‘pluralist’) regimes should pursue fewer foreign policy ‘adventures’ that are out of step with their public’s interests. However, some research has shown that access to information or other bureaucratic obstacles may be as much of an impediment to public involvement in foreign policy decision-making in a democratic state as it is in an authoritarian one, reducing the differences on foreign policy between the two regime types.
Within the context of regime-oriented considerations of the domestic origins of foreign policy is the ‘democratic peace debate’. It is derived from Kant’s ‘perpetual peace’ theory in which he constructs a model of an international order that only ‘republican’ states are allowed to join.
Michael Doyle (1983), an IR scholar, transformed ‘republican’ to
‘liberal’ and notes that statistical analyses bear out the point that stable constitutional liberal democracies do not engage in war with one another. The rationale behind this is twofold. First, a ‘cultural-normative’ interpretation suggests that stable democracies resolve conflict through
Chapter 9: The role of the domestic environment
  negotiation and bargaining and, therefore, favour these same approaches in foreign policy, especially towards other democratic regimes. However, when dealing with non-democratic regimes, democratic leaders put
aside inhibitions against conflict. Concurrently, a ‘structural-institutional’ interpretation suggests that democratic regimes, founded on a system of checks and balances that effectively slow down decision-making while encouraging public consent on foreign policy decisions leading to war, act as a deterrent to war between democracies."

To the degree that a significant proportion of the population is pulled among conflicting forces, such groups and individuals have an interest in reducing the intensity of political conflict.'"
"I'm writing a motivation letter for a scolarship for a journalism course at LSE this summer, this is my letter but I want itto have a journalistic feel (as it's a journalism course) and to have a bit of a story-telling apporach and that when you finish reading it you're like yea she makes sense, that is the place for her: Dear Christof, Ruairidh, Ryan,

As an aspiring reporter focused on helping readers decode the world of international affairs, the geopolitics of climate change, and the consequential ripples of global flashpoints as they happen, I’m confident that the “International Journalism and Society: The Role of the Media in the modern world” course would be a considerable next step in shaping my academic and professional path. 

Currently in my second year, I joined an International Relations and Politics bachelor to build a strong academic foundation in understanding the complexities of global events and their far-reaching implications, eager to make sense of the world. But the more I travelled, and lived across Canada, multiple European countries, and volunteered in small villages from Tanzania to Spain, I started questioning how these issues were communicated to the public, I’ve seen firsthand how media narratives change depending on the political context, cultural norms, and language in which they are framed and started noticing how much ethically reported news that communicates these significant impacts with empathy and human scale are needed. 

 This inspired me to aim for a journalistic career that promotes understanding across cultural and geopolitical boundaries. In order to experiment with creative an journalistic writing, I took the initiative to found and lead The 4WORDER Magazine, the first student-led publication at Forward College. This project aimed to bring fresh perspectives to our academic community, with a focus on creative writing and meaningful journalism. Within three months, the magazine grew to include 20 contributors, achieving a 71% monthly open rate across three cohorts. Encouraged by this success, I expanded the initiative into The Grad Media, an online platform designed to empower aspiring writers and journalists. Self-teaching HTML and GitHub to bring the project to life, I’m building a collaborative space where students from across Europe can share their work, undergo structured peer feedback, and build essential skills. This experience taught me the importance of substance over sensationalism and solidified my commitment to ethical journalism that uplifts marginalised voices and fosters meaningful dialogue. Through these projects, I learned not only the practical skills of journalism but also the importance of leadership, collaboration, and community-building in media. Managing a diverse team of writers with different cultural backgrounds was an eye-opening experience that solidified my belief in the power of cross-cultural journalism to bridge divides. Still, something felt incomplete. While I recognise that while my academic foundation has given me the tools to decode international affairs, I now need to sharpen my journalistic skills to translate these complex issues into compelling, nuanced, and balanced narratives.  My time attending lectures at the Sciences Po Journalism School made this even clearer. Sitting among aspiring reporters, I realized that analyzing world events wasn’t enough—I needed to learn how to translate these complexities into compelling, ethically sound narratives.

Now, as I stand at the crossroads of academia and journalism, the 'International Journalism and Society' course at LSE represents the perfect path forward. I’m confident that this would be a unique opportunity to transform my academic insights into journalistic expertise to craft clear, nuanced, and empathetic narratives that resonate with a global audience. The chance to study how media, particularly social media, impacts public perception, shapes political discourse, and influences international relations is something I am particularly passionate about. As the media landscape evolves rapidly in this digital age, I want to understand how to use new media technologies and platforms to report on international crises effectively while staying true to ethical standards. What excites me most about this program is the opportunity to critically engage with the fast-paced, ever-changing media environment, gaining practical insights into how the industry I am determined to enter operates. The course’s focus on networked journalism, the media’s role in democracy, and the ethical challenges posed by global journalism aligns perfectly with my aspirations to pursue a joint master’s in International Affairs and Journalism. Furthermore, the emphasis on media in conflict zones, the ethics of war reporting, and the broader implications of misinformation present a rare chance to engage deeply with these timely and complex issues.
The opportunity to learn from leading professionals such as Professor Charlie Beckett, whose expertise in international journalism and media ethics is renowned, is a key motivator for my application. The daily lectures and guest talks from cutting-edge journalists promise to provide invaluable insights into the real-world challenges of modern media. I am particularly excited by the seminars that will encourage me to think and act like a journalist, navigating ethical and technological hurdles while producing impactful and balanced reporting. Furthermore, I believe Professor Beckett’s focus on the changing media landscape, especially in the context of global politics, will help me fine-tune my critical thinking about the responsibilities and opportunities of journalists in shaping international discourse.
This has given me a deeper understanding of how the media landscape functions at a global scale, especially in how it interacts with various industries, such as fashion and global luxury. I now seek to leverage this understanding in my journalistic work, particularly when covering topics like economic development and global trade. 

As the perfect bridge between International Relations and Journalism, I see this course not just as a stepping stone for my career but also as an opportunity to collaborate with a network of scholars, practitioners, and fellow students who are passionate about the intersection of media and international relations. I want to build relationships with mentors who can guide me in navigating the ethical complexities of modern journalism.
This scholarship represents a critical opportunity to unlock my potential as a journalist who can contribute to shaping the way the world understands the most urgent global challenges."
"explain this thesis: Local newspapers can hold back the rising tide of political division in America by turning away from the partisan battles in Washington and focusing their opinion page on local issues. When a local newspaper in California dropped national politics from its opinion page, the resulting space filled with local writers and issues. We use a pre-registered analysis plan to show that after this quasi-experiment, politically engaged people did not feel as far apart from members of the opposing party, compared to those in a similar community whose newspaper did not change. While it may not cure all of the imbalances and inequities in opinion journalism, an opinion page that ignores national politics could help local newspapers push back against political polarization."

"based on this text List the main definitions of federalism, and how they differ.Federal governments are those in which some significant degree of local or regional autonomy is somehow entrenched within the national political system through financial, legal or other effective means. Federalism is one way of making local and regional politics more important. The essential idea of federalism is not difficult to understand, although some of the definitional and institutional points which it involves are complex.
The USA provides a very clear example of federal government. Switzerland is also a federation as is Germany. Federalism is also to
be found in a number of ex-British colonies such as India, Canada and Australia. Many Latin American republics are also federal. On the other hand, there are a number of countries which describe themselves as federal but in which the degree of local autonomy is very much less. Countries can also undergo constitutional change that may have the effect of establishing or dis-establishing federalism. The Brazilian case would be a good example here. When Brazil was under military rule, it was run in a very centralised way. The notorious Fifth Institutional Act of 1969 gave the Brazilian president sweeping powers to involve themselves in local politics across the whole country. However, the Constitution of 1988, adopted under civilian rule, unquestionably establishes the principle of federalism. Mexico, too, has become more genuinely federal than was once the case, although it was until recently far more centralised than Brazil. Similarly the United Kingdom is currently a unitary state, not a federation. However, the introduction of an independent legislature for Scotland in 1999 has involved a degree of devolution.
Definitions of federalism
Broadly speaking, two criteria have been used to decide whether a country is
federal or not. The first criterion is essentially legal, the second is financial.
1. Wheare’s (1963) famous definition of federalism states that there must be a division of power such that regional and central governments are independent of each other. Later critics have found this definition too restrictive. In a world in which quite routine activities (such as trading) are often bound by international treaty, it is difficult to see how any regional government could retain independence in practice. The United States is a federal system but it would not be possible for the state
of Texas, for example, to impose restrictions on imports from Mexico in breach of the rules of NAFTA agreed between the American, Mexican and Canadian governments. Later scholars, especially American ones, have suggested that it is sufficient for the principle of non-centralisation to be established, possibly through a written constitution whose provisions are subject to interpretation by a constitutional court. In fact, it is difficult to establish precise legal principles that underlie federalism but these may be indicative of one situation or the other.
2. In federal systems, local and regional governments have significant revenue-raising powers that are under their own discretion. The budgets of these governments should also be a significant proportion of the national budget. The most financially decentralised country in the contemporary world is Switzerland, followed by Brazil and then the USA.
3. There is another way of seeking to understand federal forms of government, which is to understand why federalist political forms were chosen in the first place. In today’s world, secession is a possibility for regions in which separation is favoured by a majority. For example,
the Czech and Slovak republics separated in 1990. On the other hand, there are also many unitary states. So why choose a half-way house?"
"define local government and explain the main strengths and weaknesses of strong systems of local government: Some political philosophers and historians have argued that participatory local government is a foundation stone of democracy nationally. Whether or not this claim can be validated, it is clear that every democracy has some form of devolved or local government. It is generally accepted that local politicians will know a locality and its needs better than central government. It is also generally regarded as desirable in a democracy
for people to be able to vote more often than once in four or five years. Although not everybody is interested in local participation, some people will take advantage of opportunities to participate in local affairs in ways that would be impossible for them nationally. Local politics is either unpaid or badly paid, and the cost of administration is reduced by relying to some extent on voluntary or semi-voluntary forms of activity. Problems in local government
Local government is not always a satisfactory form of administration in practice. Issues of decentralising (or even recentralising) power are not
as simple as they may appear, and there is a vast and complex academic literature on the subject. One problem is defining what is ‘local’. There are localities that attract genuine loyalty from the inhabitants, but the units
of attachment may be administratively inconvenient. By the same token, superficially efficient administrative units may not be meaningful entities to those who live in them. It may be that local attachments are in decline in the contemporary globalised world. People are much more mobile than they used to be, and may travel significant distances to and from work. These factors may undermine the concept of ‘locality’.
There is a real problem with fiscal decentralisation. People may tend
to move from higher to lower-taxed areas. Localities are then forced to compete with each other by lowering taxes until essential public services can no longer be afforded. Another problem is that there are few significant administrative tasks that can be conducted purely at one level. Local government generally involves some degree of central government financing and some forms of central regulation and control. Where this is not the case, the political systems are likely to have some federal characteristics. Federalism will be discussed in the next section of this chapter.
A further difficulty with localising power is that there are various forms
of expertise, which are not readily available on a local basis. There
are greater resources of professional expertise in central than in local government. The more participatory structure of local government may act as a counterweight to this. However, where local politics is not seen as meaningful in its own terms, there is a danger that local participation may become just another sphere of competition between the national political parties. There is then a danger that the most talented local politicians
will move into national politics, leaving the less talented ones to run local affairs.
Finally, there is the problem that relationships between central and
local government are potentially influenced by competitive political relationships. This can result in central and local government blaming each other when things go wrong. Or it can lead to central government favouring some localities over others using criteria which are ostensibly technical but actually political. A good example was the way in which
the Conservative government in Britain during the 1980s favoured local districts of London controlled by their own party: these were consequently able to levy the unpopular Community Charge (poll tax) at a lower level than elsewhere.
Efforts have also been made to encourage stronger local government in some developing countries as part of the World Bank’s ‘good governance’ initiative, which will be discussed again in the next chapter. It was believed that stronger local government would help with ‘good governance’. However, the attempts have not so far been an unqualified success. Local government has proved expensive, and involved a lot of human resources that might have been deployed elsewhere.
Furthermore, because local government generally does not have very much power, the failure of central government institutions cannot easily be put right at local level. Apart from being dependent on central government, local politicians and officials are at least as vulnerable to media criticism and judicial challenge as are national politicians and officials. Local government, in other words, works well when national political institutions work well – and not usually otherwise. Finally, local government tends to help the articulate middle classes more than the less fortunate. It does little to empower the very poor. This tends to be a problem with almost all democratic institutions that encourage participation.
Within the developed world, the extent and autonomy of local government varies between political systems. Page and Goldsmith (1987) found that there was far more local autonomy in northern Europe than in southern Europe. Nevertheless, southern European localities were better able to influence national government than were their northern counterparts. The authors provide a number of possible explanations for this, but conclude that the more bureaucratic forms of government in northern Europe led to a different power structure than the more clientelist forms of government in the south."

: Dear Christof, Ruairidh, Ryan, 

As an aspiring reporter focused on helping readers decode the world of international affairs, the geopolitics of climate change, and the consequential ripples of global flashpoints as they happen, I’m confident that the “International Journalism and Society: the role of the media in modern world” course would be a considerable next step in shaping my academic and professional path. 

In my second year of International Relations and Politics, I developed a strong foundation in understanding the complexities of global events and their far-reaching implications. Alongside this knowledge, I discovered a passion for ethically reported news that communicates these significant impacts with empathy and human scale. However, I recognize that while my academic background has given me the tools to decode international affairs, I now need to develop the journalistic skills required to effectively translate this understanding into compelling, balanced reporting. I strongly believe that this program would allow me to transform my academic understanding into actionable journalistic skills, equipping me to craft clear, balanced, and empathetic narratives that resonate with a global audience. 

What excites me about this course is to understand and critically engage with the media landscape today and get the core foundations of how the industry I want to enter in my foreseeable future works. It perfectly bridges International Relations and Journalism with topics like networked journalism, the media's role in democracy and the ethics of global journalism, giving me also insight on the post-graduate that I have chosen (joint master in international affairs and journalism). Moreover, the focus on critical issues like the role of media in conflict zones, the ethical challenges of war reporting, and the broader impact of misinformation deeply resonates with my aspiration to become an investigative reporter and offers me an invaluable opportunity to gain my first practical insight into the complexities of journalism in high-stakes environments. 

In my early-career as a journalist, I’ve decided to found The 4WORDER Magazine, the first independent, student-led publication at Forward College, which reinforced my passion for upholding balance and objectivity through unpretentious prose, and dismantling headline-driven news writing that lacks substance or context. The project in only three months included  a team of 20 contributors, including writers, editors, and graphic designers, achieving a 71% monthly open rate across our three cohorts. This passion led me to evolve The 4WORDER Magazine into The Grad Media, a free online platform dedicated to empowering aspiring writers and journalists. Teaching myself HTML and GitHub to bring the project to life, The Grad Media is a collaborative space where students across Europe can share their creative and journalistic work, but only after it has gone through a structured process of peer feedback. This unique approach not only ensures the quality of published content but also fosters networking, skill-building, and confidence among contributors. Moreover, my time as a Showroom Assistant with luxury brands such as Tory Burch in Milan, and Givenchy in Paris strengthened my ability to manage high-pressure environments and maintain meticulous attention to detail, skills I’m eager to apply to amplifies marginalised voices.

This course would help target my content better and ensure the quality of my writing. My perspective as a journalist has been profoundly shaped by a life lived across borders. Having called Canada, the U.S and multiple European countries home, I bring a cross-cultural lens to my work, supported by fluency in English, Italian, and French, and beginner proficiency in Portuguese and Swahili. These experiences inform my storytelling, enabling me to approach narratives with nuance and empathy. Moreover, directly learning from Charlie Beckett would not only be a valuable learning experience but also a unique privilege. 

It represents the perfect next step in developing my voice as a journalist while embracing the challenge of translating international affairs into stories that inform, engage, and inspire."
"make the conlcusion more on point: To what extent is Foreign Policy informed by rational calculation?

Foreign Policy Analysis, a subfield of International Relations that explains foreign policy behavior by examining the decision-making processes of individuals and groups (Smith et al., 2016), often perceives foreign policy decisions as rational calculations driven by national interest and strategic considerations. However, the complexity of international relations challenges this assumption. The essay will first analyze Rational Choice Theory to explore the extent to which states act as strategic actors. It will then examine psychological factors, particularly the influence of ideology in shaping national identity, threat perception, and policy priorities. Ultimately, this essay argues that while foreign policy is informed by rational calculation to a significant extent, as states frequently pursue strategic goals through cost-benefit analysis, particularly in areas such as security and economic policy, the assumption of pure rationality is limited. Cognitive biases and ideological commitments introduce subjective perceptions and competing interests, which can lead to suboptimal or inconsistent decision-making. A more nuanced approach that incorporates both strategic logic and psychological influences is required. 

Rational choice approach assumes that states, acting as unitary decision-making actors, make rational decisions by weighing options and selecting the most efficient means to achieve them through a cost-benefit analysis (Alden and Aran, 2017; Hill, 2003). Rooted in realism, the theory presents a logical decision-making process that takes place in an anarchic international system where national interest, survival, security, and power are the primary concerns and drivers of foreign policy actions (Smith et al, 2016). Consequently, this model suggests that foreign policy decisions are predictable, grounded in self-interest, utility maximization and material factors such as military capabilities and economic resources. The U.S. strategic competition with China exemplifies a calculated approach to maximizing national interests while managing risks and costs. Measures such as economic sanctions, trade restrictions on high-tech sectors, and military initiatives like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue aim to maintain economic and military dominance, protect national security, and uphold global influence (Leffler, 2019b). Yet, the deep economic interdependence between the two nations forces the U.S. to balance confrontation with cooperation (Yin, 2020), as seen in selective engagements on climate change and public health. This strategic duality—countering China’s rise while preserving economic ties—reflects how the U.S. employs cost-benefit analysis to achieve long-term objectives. While Rational Choice Theory offers a useful framework for understanding decision-making, critics argue that it often oversimplifies the complexities of political life. One of the primary criticisms is its assumption that the state acts as a unitary actor, neglecting the role of individual decision-makers and internal divisions within government institutions. Scholars such as Jervis (1976) and Sprout and Sprout (1956) contend that foreign policy decisions are frequently influenced by cognitive biases and misperceptions, which can lead to suboptimal choices that deviate from strict cost-benefit analyses. Additionally, psychological and ideological influences shape threat perception and national identity, further complicating the rationalist model. Ultimately, while Rational Choice Theory provides a structured analytical tool, a more nuanced approach that incorporates psychological and cognitive dimensions is essential for understanding the complexities of foreign policy in an evolving international environment. 

The psychological approach to foreign policy decision-making argues that foreign policy outcomes are influenced not only by rational calculations but also by ideological frameworks that shape a state's worldview, policy priorities, and strategic behavior. Ideology acts as a cognitive filter, shaping how states perceive threats and opportunities, often leading to decisions driven by deeply ingrained beliefs rather than purely strategic considerations. It provides a stable framework that justifies social practices and influences how groups interact internally and externally (Knight, 2006; Van Dijk, 2013). In foreign policy, ideology shapes national identity, strategic interests, and threat perception, often resulting in decisions that prioritize ideological consistency over pragmatic responses, even at significant strategic or economic costs.The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq exemplifies how ideological commitments, particularly American exceptionalism, influenced foreign policy decisions that did not always align with strict cost-benefit analysis. According to Restad (2012), U.S. foreign policy is not merely a reaction to shifting geopolitical conditions but is rooted in a deeply embedded ideological framework of unilateral internationalism, where engagement with the world is shaped by the belief in America's exceptional role. Despite significant strategic, economic, and diplomatic risks, the Bush administration pursued the invasion under the ideological framework of spreading democracy and combating perceived threats to global stability (Kennedy, 2011). Rooted in the belief that the U.S. had a unique responsibility to lead the world and reshape the Middle East in its image, the decision to invade was heavily influenced by the notion that the U.S. was an indispensable nation tasked with promoting freedom and security worldwide. However, critics argue that while ideology shapes foreign policy, structural constraints often force states to balance ideological aspirations with practical concerns (Knight, 2006). Despite ideological commitments, states must address economic dependencies, security challenges, and geopolitical rivalries, necessitating pragmatism. The prolonged instability and financial costs of post-invasion Iraq highlight the limits of ideology-driven decisions and the need for strategic recalibration. Critics such as Mintz (2004) contend that foreign policy results from both ideological motives and pragmatic adjustments, emphasizing the interplay between aspirations and structural realities. Thus, while ideology offers valuable insights, it does not operate in isolation. Its influence must be considered alongside structural and strategic factors, underscoring the need for a balanced approach that integrates ideological and practical considerations in shaping foreign policy.
While Rational Choice Theory provides a useful framework for analyzing foreign policy behavior and informs foreign policy to a certain extent, its assumptions don’t always align with reality. Real-world decision-making is often shaped by bounded rationality, where leaders face informational gaps, cognitive limitations, and competing domestic and international pressures (Hill, 2003). The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, for instance, highlights how ideological imperatives, particularly American exceptionalism, influenced policy choices despite the significant economic and strategic risks involved (Restad, 2012). This demonstrates that while states aim to maximize utility, foreign policy decisions often reflect a complex interplay between strategic interests and subjective influences. Given these limitations, Mintz (2004) proposed the poliheuristic theory as a more comprehensive model that integrates rational choice with psychological insights. This theory argues that leaders first eliminate politically unacceptable options using a non-compensatory rule before engaging in a rational cost-benefit analysis of the remaining choices. By combining elements of both approaches, the poliheuristic model acknowledges the cognitive constraints that shape decision-making while retaining a strategic perspective. Thus, while rational calculation remains an important driver of foreign policy, it cannot fully explain decision-making in isolation. The poliheuristic approach provides a more nuanced understanding, bridging the gap between strategic logic and psychological influences. Foreign policy is best analyzed through this integrated lens, recognizing that while states pursue their interests rationally, they do so within cognitive and political constraints.
In conclusion, rational calculation plays a significant role in informing foreign policy. Its value lies in promoting thoughtful, reasoned approaches to decision-making, even in the face of uncertainty and competing pressures. However, it should be viewed as a guiding principle, not a rigid framework, as cognitive biases, emotional responses, and misperceptions significantly  influence foreign policy decisions."

"act as a democracy and democratisation expert, explain this in a discursive way. Follow the author's train of though in explaining : 
THE SECOND MAIN ROUTE to the world of modern industry we have called the capitalist and reactionary one, exemplified most clearly by Germany and Japan. There capitalism took hold quite firmly in both agriculture and industry and turned them into industrial countries. But it did so without- a popular revolutionary upheaval. What tendencies there were. in this direction were weak, far weaker in Japan than in Germany, and in both were diverted and crushed. Though not the only cause, agrarian conditions and the specific types of capitalist transformation that took place in the countryside contributed very heavily to these defeats and the feeble­ ness behind any impulse toward Western ·democratic forms.
There are certain forms of capitalist transformation in the countryside that may succeed economically, in the sense of yielding good profits, but which are for fairly obvious reasons unfavorable to the growth of free institutions of the nineteenth-century West­ ern variety. Though these forms shade into each other, it is easy to distinguish two general types. A landed upper class may, as in Japan, maintain intact the preexisting peasant society, introducing just enough changes in rural society to ensure that the peasants gen­ erate a sufficient surplus that it can appropriate and market at a profit. Or a landed upper class may devise wholly new social ar­ rangements along the lines of plantlltion slavery. Straightforward slavery in modern times is likely to be the creation of a class of colonizing intruders into tropical areas. In parts of eastern Europe, however, indigenous nobilities were able to reintroduce serfdom, which reattached the peasants to the soil in ways that produced somewhat similar results. This was a halfway form between the two others.
Both the system of maintaining peasant society intact but squeezing more out of it and the use of servile or semiservice labor on large units of cultivation require strong political methods to ex­ tract the surplus, keep the Jabor force in its place, and in general make the system work. Not all of these methods are of course political in the narrow sense. Particularly where the peasant society is preserved, there are all sorts of attempts to use traditional rela­ tionships and attitudes as the basis of the landlords' position. Since these political methods have important consequences, it will be helpful to give them a name. Economists distinguish between labor­ intensive and capital-intensive types of agriculture, depending on whether the system uses large amounts of labor or capital. It may also be helpful to speak of labor-repressive systems, of which slav­ ery is but an extreme type. The difficulty with such a notion is that one may legitimately ask precisely what type has not been labor­ repressive. The distinction I am trying to suggest is one between the use of political mechanisms (using the term ""political"" broadly as just indicated) on the one hand and reliance on the labor market,
on the other hand, to ensure an adequate labor force for working the soil and the creation of an agricultural surplus for consumption by other classes. Those at the bottom suffer severely in both cases.
To make the conc«ption of a labor-repressive agricultural sys­ tem useful, it would be well to stipulate that large numbers of peo­ ple are kept at work in this fashion. It is also advisable to state explicitly what it does not include, for example, the American fam­ ily farm of the rnidnineteenth century. There may have been ex­ ploitation of the labor of family members in this case, but it was done apparently mainly by the head of the household himself with minimal assistance from the outside. Again, a system of hired agri­ cultural laborers where the workers had considerable real freedom to refuse jobs and move about, a condition rarely met in actual practice, would not fall under this rubric. Finally, precommercial and preindustrial agrarian systems are not necessarily labor repres­ sive if there is a rough balance between the overlord's contribution to justice and security and the cultivator's contribution in the form
 Revolution from Above and Fascism 435
of crops. Whether this balance can be pinned down in any objec­ tive sense is a moot point best discussed in the following chapter when the issue arises in. connection with the causes of peasant revo­ lutions. Here we need only remark that the establishment of labor­ repressive agrarian systems in the course of modernization does not necessarily produce greater suffering among the peasants than other forms. Japanese peasants had an easier time of it than did English ones. Our problem here is in any case a different one: how and why labor-repressive agrarian systems provide an nnfavorable soil for the growth of democracy and an important part of the institutional
complex leading to fascism.
In discussing the rural origins of parliamentary democracy, we
noticed that a limited degree of independence from the monarchy constituted one of the favorable conditions, though one that did not occur everywhere. While a system of labor-repre�sive agriculture may be started in opposition to·the central authority, it is likely to fuse with the monarchy at a later point in search .of political sup­ port. This situation can also lead to the preservation of a military ethic among the nobility in a manner unfavorable to the growth of democratic institutions. The evolution of the Prussian state consti­ tutes the clearest example. Since we have referred to these develop­ ments at several points in this work, it will be appropriate to sketch them very briefly here.
In northeastern Germany the manorial reaction of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, about which we shall have still more to say in quite another context, broke off the development toward the liberation of the peasantry from feudal obligations and the closely connected developlnent of town life that in England and France eventually culminated in Western democracy. A fundamental cause was the growth of grain exports, though it was not the sole one. The Prussian nobility expanded its holdings at the expense of the peasantry which, under the Teutonic Order, had been close to freedom, ·and reduced them to serfdom. As part of the same process, the nobility reduced the towns to dependence by short-circuiting them with their exports. Mterward,. the Hoheozollern rulers man­ aged to destroy the independence of the nobility and crush the Estates, playing nobles and townsmen off against one another, thereby .checking the aristocratic component in the move toward parliamentary government. The result in the seventeenth and eight­ eenth centuries was the ""Sparta of the North,"" a militarized fusion of royal bureaucracy and .landed aristocracy.l
From the side of the landed aristocracy came the conceptions of inherent superiority in the ruling class and a sensitivity to matters of status, prominent traits well into the twentieth century. Fed by new sources, these conceptions could later be vulgarized and made appealing to the German population as a whole in doctrines of ra­ cial superiority. The royal bureaucracy introduced, against consid­ erable aristocratic resistance, the ideal of complete and unreflecting obedience to an institution over and above class and individual ­ prior to the nineteenth century it would be anachronistic to speak of the nation. Prussian discipline, obedience, and admiration for the hard qualities of the soldier come mainly from the Hohenzol- lern efforts to create a centralized monarchy.
  
. All this does not of course mean that some inexorable fate
drove Germany toward fascism from the sixteenth century on­ ward, that the process never could have been reversed. Other fac­ tors had to intervene, some very important ones, as industrialization began to gather momentum during the nineteenth century. About these it will be necessary to speak in a moment. There are also sig­ nificant variants and substitutions within the general pattern that has led to fascism, subalternatives one might say if one wished to be very precise and technical, within the major alternative of con­ servative modernization through revolution from above. In Japan the notion of total commitment to a1,lthority apparently came out of the feudal, rather than the monarchical, side of the equation.2 Again in Italy, where fascism was invented, there was no powerful national monarchy. Mussolini had to go all the way back to ancient Rome for the corresponding symbolism.
At a later stage in the course of modernization, a new and cru­ cial factor is likely to appear in the form of a rough working coali­ tion between influential sectors of the landed urper classes and the emerging commercial and manufacturing interests. By and large,

Revolution from Above and Fascism 437
this was a nineteenth-century political configuration, though it con­ tinued on into the twentieth. Marx and Engels in their disciIssion of the abortive 1848 revolution in Germany, wrong though they were on other major features, put their finger on this decisive in­ gredient: a commercial and industrial class which is too weak and dependent to take power and rule in its own right and which there­ fore throws itself into the arms of the landed aristocracy and the .royal bureaucracy, exchanging the right to rule for the right to make money.3 It is necessary to add that, even if the commercial and industrial element is weak, it must be strong enough (or soon become strong enough) to be a worthwhile political ally. Other­ wise a peasant revolution leading to communism may intervene. This happened in both Russia and China after unsuccessful efforts to establish such a coalition. There also appears to be another in­ gredient that enters the situation somewhat later than the formation of this coalition: sooner or later systems of labor-repressive agri­ culture are liable to run into difficulties produced by competition from more technically advanced ones in. other countries. The com­ petition of American wheat exports created difficulties in many parts of Europe after the end of our Civil War. In the context of a reactionary coalition, such competition intensifies authoritarian and reactionary trends among a landed upper class that finds its eco­ nomic basis sinking and therefore turns to political levers to pre­ serve its rule.
Where the.coalition succeeds in establishing itself, there has followed a prolonged period of conservative and even authori­ tarian government, which, however, falls far short of fascism. The historical boundaries of such systems are often somewhat blurred. At a rather generous estimate, one might hold that to this species belong the period from the Stein-Hardenberg reforms in Germany to the end of the First World War and, in Japan, from the fall of the Tokugawa Shogunate to 1 9 1 8. These authoritarian govern­ ments acquired some democratic features: notably a parliament with limited powers. Their history may be punctuated with at­ tempts to extend democracy which, toward the end, succeeded in establishing unstable democracies (the Weimar Republic, Japan in the twenties, Italy under Giolitti). Eventually the door to fascist regimes was opened by the failure of these democracies to cope with the severe problems of the day and reluctance or inability to bring about fundamental structural changes.4 One factor, but only one, in the social anatomy of these governments has been the re­ tention of a very substantial share in political power by the landed elite, due to the absence of a revolutionary breakthrough by the peasants in combination with urban strata.
. Some of the semiparliamentary governments that arose on this basis carried out a more or less peaceful economic and political revolution from above that took them a long distance toward be­ coming modern'industrial countries. Germany travelled the furthest in this direction, Japan only somewhat less so, Italy a great deal less, Spain very little. Now, in the course of modernization by a revolution from above, such a government has to carry out many of the same tasks performed elsewhere with the help of a revolu­ tion from below. The notion that a violent popular revolution is somehow necessary in order to sweep away ""feudal"" obstacles to industrialization is pure nonsense, as the courS!! of German and Japanese history demonstrates. On the other hand, the political consequences from dismounting the old order from above are de­ cidedly different. As they proceeded with conservative moderniza­ tion, these semiparliamentary governments tried to preserve as much of the original social structure as they could, fitting large sec­ tions into the new building wherever possible. The results had some resemblance to present-day Victorian houses with modern electrical
'kitchens but insufficient bathrooms and leaky pipes hidden deco­ 'rously behind 'newly plastered walls. Ultimately the makeshifts
collapsed.
One very important series of measures was the rationalization
of the political order. This meant the breakup of traditional and long established territorial divisions, such as the feudal han in Japan or independent states and principalities in Germany and Italy. Ex­ cept in Japan, the breakup was not complete. But in the course of time a central government did establish strong authority and a uni­ form administrative system, and a more or less uniform law code and system of courts appeared. Again, in varying degrees, the state managed to create a sufficiently powerful military machine to be able to make the wishes of its rulers felt in the arena of international politics. Economically the establishment of a strong central govern­ ment and the elimination of internal barriers to trade meant an in­ crease in the size of the effective economic unit. Without such an increase in size, the division of labor necessary for an industrial society could not exist, unless all countries were willing to trade peacefully with one another. As the first country to industrialize, England had been able to draw on most of the accessible world for material and markets, a situation that gradually deteriorated during the nineteenth century when others caught up and sought to use the state to guarantee their markets and sources of supply.
Still another aspect of the rationalization of the political order has to do with the making of citizens in a new type of society. Literacy and rudimentary technical skills are necessary for the masses. Setting up a national system of education is very likely to bring on a conflict with religious authorities. Loyalty to a new abstraction, the state, must also replace religious loyalties if they transcend national boundaries or compete with one another so vig­ orously as to destroy internal peace. Japan had less of a problem here than Germany, Italy, or Spain. Yet even in Japan, as the some­ what artificial revival of Shinto indicates, there were substantial difficulties. In overcoming such difficulties, the existence of a for­ eign enemy can be quite useful. Then patriotic and conservative appeals to the military traditions of the landed aristocracy can over­ come localist tendencies among this important group and push into the background any too insistent demands of the, lower strata for an unwarranted share in the benefits of the new order.5 In carrying out the task of rationalizing and extending the political order, these nineteenth-century governments were doing work that royal ab­ solutism had already accomplished in other countries.
One striking fact about the course of conservative moderniza­ tion is the appearance of a galaxy of distinguished political leaders:' Cavour in Italy; in Germany, Stein, Hardenberg, and Bismarck, the most famous of them all; in Japan, the statesmen of the Meiji era. Though the reasons are obscure, it seems unlikely that the ap­ pearance of a similar leadership in similar circumstances could be pure coincidence. All were conservatives in the political spectrum of their time and country, devoted to the monarchy, willing and able to use it as an instrument of reform, modernization, and na­ tional unification. Though all were aristocrats, they were dissi­
dents or outsiders of a sort in relation to the old order. To the extent that their- aristocratic background contributed habits of command and a flair for politics,_ one may perhaps detect a con­ tribution of the agrarian ancien regimes to the construction of a new society. But there were strong contrary pulls here too. To the extent that these men were aliens within the aristocracy, one may see the incapacity of this stratum to meet the challenge of the mod­ ern world merely with its-own intellectual and political resources.
The most successful of the conservative regimes accomplished a great deal, not only in tearing down the old order but in estab­ lishing a new one. The state aided industrial construction in several important ways. It served as an engine of primary capitalist ac­ cumulation, gathering resources and directing them toward the building of an industrial plant. In the taming of the labor force it again played an important role, by no means entirely a repressive one. Armaments served as an important stimulus for industry. So did protectionist tariff policies. All of these measures at some point involved taking resources or people out-of agriculture. Therefore they imposed from time to time a serious strain on the coalition be­ tween those sectors of the upper strata in business and in agriculture that was the main feature of the political system. Without the threat of foreign dangers, sometimes real, sometimes perhaps im­ aginary, sometimes as in the case ofBismarck deliberately manu­ factured for domestic purposes, the landed interests might well have balked, to the point of endangering the whole process. The foreign threat alone, however, need not bear the whole weight of explaining this behavior.6 Material and other rewards - the ""payoff"" in the language of gangsters and game theory - were quite substan­ tial for both partners as long as they succeeded in keeping the peas­ ants and industrial labor in place. Where there was substantial economic pn)gress, the industrial workers were able to make sig­ nificant gains, as in Germany, where·Sozialpolitik was invented. It was in those countries that remained more backward, Italy to some extent, probably Spain to a greater extent, that there was more of a tendency to cannibalize the indigenous population.
Certain conditions seem to have been necessary for the suc­ cesses of conservative modernization. First, it takes very able lead­ ership to drag along the less. perceptive reactionary elements, concentrated among, though not necessarily confined to, the landed upper classes. In the beginning, Japan had to suppress a real rebel­ lion, the Satsuma revolt, to control these elements. Reactionaries can always advance the plausible argument that modernizing lead­ ers are making changes and qmcessions that will merely arouse the appetites of the lower classes and bring on a revolution.7 Similarly, the leadership must have at hand or be able to construct a suffi­ ciently powerful bureaucratic apparatus, including the agencies of repression, the military and the police (compare the German saying Gegen Demokraten helfen nur Soldaten) , in order to free itself from the influence of both extreme reactionary and popular or radical pressures in the society. The government has to become separate from society, something that can happen rather more easily than simplified versions 'of Marxism would allow us to believe.
In the short run, a strong conservative government has distinct· aavantages. It can both encourage and control economic growth. It can see to it that the lower classes who pay the costs under all forms of modernization do not make too much trouble. Brit Ger,. many and, even more, Japan were trying to solve a problem that was inherently insoluble, to modernize without changing their so­ cial structures. The only way out of this dilemma was'militarism, which united the upper classes. Militarism intensified a climate of international conflict, which in turn made industrial advance all the more imperative, even if in Germany a Bismarck could for a time hold the situation in check, partly because militarism had not yet become a mass phenomenon. To carry out thoroughgoing struc­ tural reforms, i.e., to make the transition to a paying commercial agriculture without the repression of those who worked the soil and to do the same in industry, in a word, to use modern tech­ nology rationally for human welfare was beyond the poli,tical vi­ sion of these governments.s Ultimately these systems crashed in an attempt at foreign expansion, but not until they had tried to make reaction popular in the form of fascism.
Before discussing this final phase, it may be instructive to glance at unsuccessful reactionary trends in other countries. As mentioned above, this reactionary syndrome cap be found at some point in all the cases I have examined. To see why it has failed in other countries may sharpen awareness of the reasons behind its successes. A brief look at these trends in such widely differing countries as England, Russia, and India may serve to bring out im­ portant underlying similarities concealed beneath a variety of his­ torical experiences.
Beginning in the latter years of the French Revolution and lasting until about 1822, English society passed through a reaction­ ary phase that recalls both the cases just discussed and contem- porary problems of American democracy. During most of these years England was fighting against a revolutionary regime and its heirs, sometimes, it may have seemed, for national survival itself. As in our own time, the advocates of domestic reform were identified with a foreign enemy represented as the incarnation of all that was evil. Again, as in our own time, the violence, repressions, and be­ trayals of the revolutionary movement in France sickened and dis.­ couraged its English supporters, making easier and more plausible the work of reactionaries eager to stamp out the sparks that floated across the channel. Writing in the 1920S the great French historian Elie Halevy, certainly not a man given to dramatic exaggeration, asserted, ""A reign. of terror was established throughout England by the nobility and middle class - a terror more formidable, though more silent, than the noisy demonstrations [of the radicals] .""9 The events of the four decades and more that have passed since Halevy wrote these lines have dulled our senseS and lowered our standards. No one writing now would be likely to refer to this phase as a reign of terror. The number of direct victims of repression was small. In the ""massacre"" of Peterloo ( 1 8 1 9) - a derisive reference to Wellington's more famous victory of Waterloo - only eleven persons Were killed. Nevertheless di.e gathering movement to re­ form Parliament was placed outside the law, the press muzzled, associations that smacked of radicalism forbidden, a rash of treason trials initiated, spies and agents provocateurs let loose among the people, the Habeas Corpus suspended after the war with Napoleon had ended. Repression and suffering were real and widespread, only partly mitigated by some continued articulate opposition: an aristo­ crat such as Charles James' Fox (d 1 806) who spoke tip cour\!­ geously in Parliament, here and there a judge or a jury that refused to convict on treason or'othe,r charges.1o Why was this reactionary upsurge no more than a passing phase in England? Why did not England continue along this road to become another Germany? Anglo-Saxon liberties, Magna Charta, Parliament and such rhetoric will not do for an answer. Parliament voted repressive measures by huge majorities.
An important part of the answer may be found in the fact that, a century before, certain extremist Englishmen had chopped off the head of their monarch to shatter the magic of royal abso­ lutism in England. At a deeper level of causation, England's whole previous history, her reliance on a navy instead of an army, on unpaid justices of t�e peace instead of royal officials, had put in the hands of the central government a repressive apparatus weaker than that possessed by the strong continental monarchies. Thus the ma­ terials with which to construct a German system were missing or
but feebly developed. Still, by now we have seen enough great social and political changes out of unpromising beginnings to sus­ pect that the institutions could have been created if circumstances had been more favorable. But fortunately for human liberties they were not. The push toward industrialism had begun much earlier in England and was to render unnecessary for th� English bourgeoisie any great dependence on the crown and the landed aristocracy. Finally, the landed upper classes themselves did not need to repress the peasants. Mainly they wanted to get them out of the way in order to go over to commercial farming; by and large, economic measures would be enough to provide the labor force they needed. Succeeding economically in this particular fashion, they had little need to resort to repressive political measures to continue their leadership. Therefore in England manufacturing and agrarian in­ terests competed with one another for popular favor during the rest of the nineteenth century, gradually extending the suffrage while jealously opposing and knocking down each other's more selfish measures (Reform Bill of I 832, abolition of the Corn Laws in I 846, gentry support for factory legislation, etc) .
In the English phase of reaction there were hints of fascist pos- sibilities, particularly in some of the antiradical riots. But these were no more than hints. The time was still too early. Fascist symptoms we can see very much more clearly in another part of the wodd at a later point in time - during a brief phase of extremism in Russia after 1 905. This was extreme even by Russian standards of the day; one could make a strong case for the thesis that Russian reaction­ aries invented fascism. Thus this phase of Russian history is espe­ cially illuminating because it shows that the fascist syndrome I ) can appear in response to the strains of advancing industrialism iQde­ pendently of a specific social and cultural background; 2) that it may have many roots in agrarian life; 3) that it appears partly in response to a weak push toward parliamentary democracy; 4) but cannot flourish without industrialism or in an overwhelmingly agrar­ ian background - points, to be sure, all suggested by the recent his­ tories of China and Japan too, though it is illuminating to find stronger confirmation in Russian history.
Shortly before the Revolution of 1905 the tiny Russian com­ mercial and industrial class showed some signs of discontent with the repressive tsarist autocracy and a willingness to flirt with liberal constitutional notions. Workers' strikes, however, and the promise contained in the Imperial Manifesto of October 1 7, 1 905, to meet some of the demands of the strikers, brought the industrialists safely back within the tsarist camp.ll Against this background appeared the Black Hundreds movement. Drawing partly on American ex­ perience, they made ""lynch"" into a Russian word and asked for the application of zakon lyncha, lynch law. They resorted to violence in storm-trooper style to suppress ""treason"" and ""sedition."" If Rus­ sia could destroy the ""kikes"" and foreigners, their propaganda as­ serted, everyone could live happily in a return to ""true Russian"" ways. This anti-Semitic nativism had considerable appeal to back­ ward, precapitalist, petty bourgeois elements in the cities and among the smaller nobility. However, in still backward peasant Russia of the early twentieth century, this form of rightist extrem­ ism was unable to find a firm popular basis. Among the peasants it succeeded mainly in areas of mixed nationality, where the explana- tion of all evil as being due to Jews and foreigners made some sense in terms of peasant experience.12 As everyone knows, to the extent that they were politically active, the Russian peasants were revolu­ tionary and eventually the major force in exploding the old regime.
In India, which is equally if not more backward, similar move­ ments have likewise failed to obtain a firm basis among the masses. To be sure, Subhas Chandra Bose, who died in 1 945, expressed dic­ tatorial sentiments, worked for the Axis, and had a very large popu­ lar following. Though his fascist sympathies were consistent with other aspects of his public record and do not seem to be the out:­ come of momentary enthusiasm or opportunism, Subhas Chandra Bose has gone down in Indjan tradition mainly as an extreme and perhaps misguided anti-British patriotY There has also been a scat­ tering of nativist Hindu political organizations, some of which de­ veloped the autocratic discipline of the European totalitarian party. They have reached the peak of their influence so far in the chaos and riots surrounding Partition, during which they helped to pro­ mote anti-Muslim riots and served as defense organs for Hindu communities against Muslim attacks, led, presumably, by similar organizations on the Muslim side. Their programs lack economic content and appear to be mainly a form of militant, xenophobic Hinduism, seeking to combat the stereotype that Hindus are pa­ cific, divided by caste, and weak. So far their electoral appe�l has been very small.14
One possible reason for the weakness of the Hindu variant of fascism to date may be the fragmentation of the Hindu world along caste, class, and ethnic lines. Thus a characteristically fascist appeal addressed to one segment would antagonize others, while a more general appeal, by taking on some color of universal panhumanism, begins to lose its fascist qualities. In this connection it is worth no­ ticing that nearly all the extremist Hindu groups have opposed un- touchability and other social disabilities of caste.15 The main reason, however, is probably the simple fact that Gandhi had already pre­ empted the antiforeign and anticapitalist sentiment of huge masses of the population: peasants and artisans in the cottage industries. Under the conditions created by the British occupation, he was able to tie these sentiments to the interests of a large section of the busi.;. ness class. On the other hand, the landed elite generally stood aloof. Thus reactionary trends have been strong in India and have helped to delay economic progress since Independence. But as a mass phe­ nomenon the larger movements belong to an historical species dis­ tinct from fascism.
Though it might be equally profitable to undertake a parallel consideration of democratic failures that preceded fascism in Ger­ many, Japan, and Italy, it is enough for present purposes to notice that fascism is inconceivable without democracy or what is some­ times more turgidly called the entrance of the masses onto the historical stage. Fascism was an attempt to make reaction and con­ servatism popular and plebeian, through which conservatism, of course, Jost the substantial connection it did have with freedom, some aspects of which were discussed in the preceding chapter.
The conception of objective law vanished under fascism. Among its most significant features was a violent rejection of hu­ manitarian ideals, including any notion of potential human equality. The fascist outlook stressed not only the inevitability of hierarchy, discipline, and obedience, but also posited that they were values in their own right. Romantic conceptions of comradeship qualify this outlook but slightly; it is comradeship in submission. Another fea­ ture was the stress on violence. This stress goes far beyond any cold, rational appreciation of the factual importance of violence in politics to a mystical worship of ""hardness"" for its own sake. Blood and death often acquire overtones of erotic attraction, though iIi its less exalted moments fascism was thoroughly ""healthy"" and ""nor­ mal,"" promising return to a cosy bourgeois•. and even prebourgeois peasant, womb.ls Plebeian anticapitalism thus appears as the feature that most clearly distinguishes twentieth-century fascism from its predeces­ sors, the nineteenth-century conservative and semiparliamentary regimes. It is a product of both the intrusion of capitalism into the rural econo"
"act as a democracy and democratisation expert, explain this in a discursive way. Follow the author's train of though in explaining : Historical sociology is a kind of ‘macrohistory’ in which history is ‘the instrument by which structures are discovered invisible to the unaided eye’ (Collins 1999: 1). It is because of this emphasis on structures that the approach is sometimes termed ‘structuralism’. ‘Historical sociol- ogy’ and ‘structuralism’ are often used interchangeably in democratiza- tion studies. An important strand of historical sociology has been the search to identify different trajectories of state development or paths to modernity, through, for example, war or revolution (Skocpol 1979; Tilly 1990). The historical/sociological approach to democratization has two particular intellectual origins. In part, it arose out of a reaction to the excessively society-based accounts of political change implicit in behav- iouralism in the 1960s, and offers instead a state-centred view. It is therefore part of the intellectual labour of ‘bringing the state back in’ to politics (Evans , Rueschmeyer and Skocpol 1985). It also drew explic- itly on a critique of the short-termism and causal simplicity of modern- ization as an explanation of democratization (Rueschmeyer, Stephens and Stephens 1992). It is, inevitably, a much more diffuse approach to democratization than modernization theory, with a primary interest in explaining, not predicting, outcomes.
Structuralists are interested in how the changing relationship between the state, understood in the Weberian sense of ‘a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory’ (Skocpol 1985: 7; italics in the original), and classes shapes the political system. As such, they admit an impor- tant role for collective actors. They are agreed that democracies do not come into being overnight; nor does democracy happen simply because some people (individuals, groups, or classes) will it into existence. Structuralists trace the transformation of the state through class conflict over time, in order to explain how democracy – which they see as state transformation – has sometimes emerged. Structuralism also contains elements of a political economy of democratization in that it emphasizes how changes in the economy – for example the expansion of production for the market – lead to social or class conflict, although economic change is not, on its own, regarded as determining political outcomes. Unlike the wave approach of modernization theory, historical sociology identifies factors that are distinctive to particular cases.
Barrington Moore’s (1966) major study of political change consti- tutes a significant milestone for historical/sociological understanding of democratization. His comparative analysis of eight ‘big’ countries, Britain, France, the US, Germany, Russia, Japan, China and India, through the nineteenth century and into the twentieth, identified the dif- ferent historical trajectories that each had travelled to reach modernity. Fascism and Communism simply constituted a different version of modernity, resulting from very different sets of relationships between collective actors and states. For Moore, outcomes depended on the inter- actions between three important classes – the peasantry, the landed upper class and the bourgeoisie. Essentially, democracy occurred when
● the ‘peasant question’ was solved by the gradual elimination of peasant agriculture and the rise of opportunities for transforming the peasantry into urban workers through the expansion of towns and industrial employment opportunities; and
● the landed class was defeated and transformed in its struggles for control of the state by the rising bourgeoisie.
This latter was crucial in determining whether democracy or a form of dictatorship emerged (see Box 3.1).
Moore’s work concentrated on the emergence of the first democracies. It was modified by Rueschmeyer, Stephens and Stephens (1992) in the light of later history and the expansion of the number of parliamentary and stable democracies. They describe their theoretical framework as part of the ‘new comparative political economy’ (Rueschmeyer, Stephens and Stephens 1992: 40). By this, they mean that they view the political system of a particular country in relationship to broader ques- tions of social power. Their work draws on a synthesis of scholarship from classical sociology and Marxism. It was ground-breaking because of its stress on the impact of what they termed ‘three power structures’: relative class power, the role of the state and the impact of transnational power structures.
They draw from Marxism a view that social class and class conflict constitute the starting point for an analysis of power and the state. They add to Moore’s three-class schema, with its emphasis on rural change, a discussion of other subordinate classes, and of the urban working class in particular. But their emphasis on class divisions and class struggle is modified by a recognition of the role of the state and the role of the state system. In particular, they argue that whilst states have a special depend- ence upon capitalists under capitalism this has not always prevented working-class organizations from reforming the state. In other words, they see democratization as the imposition of reforms on a capitalist state, not as an automatic outcome from the development of capitalist relations of production. Without successful and self-conscious reformist strategies on the part of the subordinated classes, capitalist states will, in fact, almost inevitably be authoritarian (Box 3.2 The Role of the Working Class in Democratization
Rueschmeyer, Stephens and Stephens (1992) assert the central importance of urban working classes for democratization:
The organized working class appeared everywhere as a key actor in the development of full democracy ... In most cases, organized workers played an important role in the development of restricted democracy as well. The Latin American ... working class played a lesser role in the historical events there: the relative weakness of the working class certainly has contributed to the infrequence of full democracy in the region and to the instability of democracy where it did emerge. ... In all regions, however, pressure from the organized working class alone was insufficient to bring about the introduction of democracy; the working class needed allies. ... Democracy could only be established if (1) landlords were an insignificant force, or (2) they were not dependent on a large supply of cheap labor, or (3) they did not control the state. (Rueschmeyer, Stephens and Stephens 1992: 270)). Furthermore, they suggest that a third dimension influences the nature of the state: the transnational context. This is particularly so in the case of the under-developed and dependent countries. In any analysis of democratization struggles, therefore, the role of geo-political factors will be important. However, they remain agnostic as to ‘the overall relationship between democracy and political/economic dependence in transnational rela- tions’ (Rueschmeyer, Stephens and Stephens 1992: 73). In other words, it is unclear whether external dependence supports or hinders democra- tization.
Evaluating Historical Sociology
The strength of historical sociology is that it is richly grounded and explanatory; and that it provides the possibility of comparison across time as well as across countries or regions. However, historical and structural approaches have been the subject of a number of criticisms. Historical sociology has become largely unfashionable, like all struc- turalist explanations of social change. Structuralism has, in general, fallen foul of the rediscovery of individual agency and volition in poli- tics, of the questioning of Marxian class analysis and of the post-modern suggestion that power is too diffuse a concept to be understood in any static way; it is, instead, located in changing and fluid relationships. The major critiques of structuralism have therefore been both ontological and epistemological: its view of the world is too simple or simply wrong. As Przeworski (1991: 96) put it: ‘in this formulation the outcome is uniquely determined by conditions, and history goes on without anyone ever doing anything’. In fact, however, historical sociology does recognize a considerable role for agency in processes of political trans- formation. The main agents of change are classes, or even the state. But thise notion of collective action is not sufficient to satisfy critics who only accept individuals as agents.
Other, more empirically-based, criticisms have also been forthcom- ing. Structuralism, with its emphasis on long-term historical change, seemed unable to account for the onset of sudden democratization in societies such as East and Central Europe and the countries of the ex- Soviet Union, where there was apparently little evidence of class agita- tion or struggle for democracy, except shortly before the collapse of authoritarianism. It was logical, therefore, especially in the light of the rise of agency-based theories of political behaviour through the 1980s, that dissatisfaction with structuralism would lead directly to a new agency-centred paradigm of democratization. Before analyzing the rise of ‘transition studies’, however, we examine the utility of historical sociology for analysis of contemporary democratizations. Historical Sociology Today
An analysis of structures has particularly fed into the debate surround- ing the consolidation of democracy. The idea that struggle and con- frontation after the immediate transition can be symptoms of democratization comes from structuralism. It is therefore an appropri- ate tool for the analysis of post-transition systems. Structural analysis recognizes the fundamental class antagonisms of capitalist societies and suggests that conflict is a ‘normal’ part of democracy. It provides the researcher with the tools to question the idea that democratization requires the subordination of sectional and class interests for democracy to take root. By linking democracy with conflict, structuralism sees con- frontation as a normal part of the pattern of the emerging democratic order. A structuralist perspective, with its emphasis on history, conflict, class and the state can also contribute to explanations of partial or incomplete democratizations. Gariorowski and Power (1998) argue that the chances for democratic consolidation are affected by ‘development- related socio-economic factors, the contagion effect of democratic neighbors and high inflation’. They therefore draw the conclusion that all explanations of democratization should be placed within a broader structural perspective in order to fully understand the process of politi- cal change. Finally, structuralism is important in contextualizing and situating the debate about democratization. It allows for the identification of global structures that condition and shape the environ- ment in which democratization takes place and points to the importance of ‘underlying economic conditions and social forces’ in democratiza- tion (Haggard and Kaufman 1997).
We return to the salience of historical sociology for understanding contemporary democratizations below."
"act as a comparative politics expert, explain strategy A and strategy B in a discursive way: Since the term 'populism' refers to a wide variety of apparently different things, any account that is to be useful must somehow reduce this, diversity to order. The two alternative strategies I have mentioned offer different ways of doing this. The first, which I shall call Strategy A, is concerned above all to bring the different cases under one theoretical roof, providing an account of the essential features of populism and the conditions under which it occurs. Its object is to demonstrate unity in diversity by getting underneath the surface of populist ideas and movements, like a physicist investigating the essential structure of matter.
Strategy B, by contrast, is more reminiscent of a naturalist collecting beetles and arranging them in groups. This approach is phenomenological, concerned with description rather than with explanation, aiming at comprehensiveness in preference to theoretical elegance.
Students of populism have tended to adopt Strategy A, for two reasons. The first is a by-product of the fact that they have usually been specialists starting from a particular area, such as Russian Populism or Latin American Populism. Within any one of these areas it is not too difficult to identify a reasonably clear core of 'populist' phenomena, and some of these specialists have developed sophisticated theories of populism as known in their own field. ^ Having gained theoretical confidence in one field, the specialist naturally tends to believe that his account can be applied to populism in general, provided the right variables are added to explain local differences.^ As Peter Wiles has remarked. T o each his own definition of populism, according to the academic axe he grinds'.' The first reason for the popularity of Strategy A, therefore, is that those who feel they understand one kind of populism naturally assume that it must be possible to provide a clear account of the thing in general. One might suppose that this belief would rapidly disappear upon further acquaintance with the diversity of 'populist' phenomena. But this is to reckon without the fascination of an intellectual challenge. The search for a clear account of populism has all the attractions of a treasure hunt. What could be more satisfying than to hit upon a single theory that could explain such a diverse collection of movements and ideas? As one writer has remarked, 'What makes populism such an enthralling study object is that a comparative analysis can reveal a number of similarities without these being recognised as such by the movements themselves'.®
There has been no lack of incentive, therefore, for students of populism to provide a general theoretical structure that would clarify the subject. The results have been disappointing, however. When we look at the various attempts at a theoretical account of populism, we find that they are all open to one or other of two objections. Either they are comprehensive but too vague, or else they are clear but too narrow. Let us look at some examples of each failing.
The social scientist who sets out to reduce populism to order is liable to fall into a trap. Looking at the enormous range of movements and ideas generally called 'populist', and anxious to bring them all within his net, he tends to propose a theory which is indeed wide enough to include them all, but which is so wide that it includes virtually everything else as well.
One example of this is an article by J. B. Allcock which appeared in 1971. This began with a useful 'biography' of populism, that is, an account of the many different purposes to which social scientists had adapted the term. As Allcock remarked, the notion had accumulated 'a bewildering variety of subtly different connotations'.^ Evidently it had become very difficult to decide how to tell whether a particular movement or ideology was populist or not. Instead of attending to his own warning, however, Allcock shifted the focus of discussion to the 'social base' of populism, which lay (he suggested) in 'part-societies': 'Many of 'the distinctive characteristics of the populist response are to be understood in the context of ""part/whole"" structures of the type analysed by the anthropological students of peasant society'.^° Reference to this framework could, Allcock suggested, make it possible 'to integrate all the various aspects of the phenomenon of populism'. ^ ^
At first sight this looks promising. The notion of 'part-societies', of groups that are in a sense both 'inside' and 'outside of a wider society, surely does describe, say, the relation of US Populist farmers to the Eastern commercial community, or of nineteenth-century Russian intellectuals to Russian society on the one hand and European culture on the other. Upon refiection, however, the hidden snag appears: this is too all-embracing to be illuminating, for it could be applied to virtually any political phenomenon.^^ For example, the working  MARGARET CANOV AN 547
class in industrial societies forms a 'part' of a wider 'whole' upon which it depends, but from which it is in some ways distinct. Are all labour movements therefore 'populist' too? If they are, what is not populist? And if they are not populist, why are they not?
In other words, accounts of populism that are general enough to cover all the cases that happen to be commonly given the name tend to be so all-embracing that they cover everything indiscriminately. Another example which suffers from the same defects as Allcock's article, and which is also sociological in its orientation, is Angus Stewart's essay on 'The Social Roots' of populism.^^ Stewart's way of tackhng the diversity of the field is to claim that 'the unity that is popuHsm may . . . be demonstrated to lie . . . in the recurrent pattern of an ideal type of social relation'. ^""^ Populism is, it seems, a response to the problems of modernization, and springs in particular from the tension between advanced and backward sections of society, both inside a particular country and in its relations with the outside world. Populist movements appear among social groups aware of being peripheral to centres of power, and involve an indirect confrontation with problems of economic development. The differences between them are to be explained by means of a number of variables. For example, while all populist movements are responses to developmental problems, some, like Narodnichestvo, are responding to the initial prospect of industrialization, while others, such as US populism, are less concerned about the problems of economic backwardness than with 'the pace and pattern of the modernisation process'. ^ ^ Similarly, Stewart argues that all populist movements are 'Janus-faced', combining traditional and modern elements, but that this common feature gives rise to different variants in different contexts.
Stewart shows considerable ingenuity in developing an account of populism general enough to cover all the expected cases. The trouble is that it is hard to see what explanations as general as these would not fit. For example, it could be plausibly argued that sociahst movements are responses to crises of moderniza- tion; that they mobilize people who feel peripheral to centres of power; that they combine traditional and non-traditional elements (evocations of pre- industrial fraternity and promises of a brave new world). ^^ The same terms could easily fit conservatism, too. The point is that these common features of 'populist' movements are really common features of modern political move- ments in general, so that this line of argument ends with all modern politics swallowed up in a nebulous and distended concept of 'populism'.
Clearly, then, those who follow Strategy A and try to catch all cases of 'populism' in one theoretical net find themselves in difficulties. There is another  548 TWO STRATEGIES FOR THE STUDY OF POPULISM
version of the strategy, however, which has the advantages of greater clarity and precision. The theorist need not assume that he has to include all movements and ideas that happen to be called 'populist'. After all, the current use of the term is a highly contingent affair. Instead, he may select certain cases that quite obviously do have substantial features in common, and propose a coherent theory based on these, accepting as populist only cases that share the features required by his theory and ruthlessly excluding all other claimants of the title. This approach makes possible a greater degree of theoretical coherence: its defect is that different theorists are liable to make different selections from the medley of populist phenomena, and hence to propose theories that are mutually exclusive, one of them leaving out cases that are crucial to another.
Specialists have often done this unconsciously, laying claim to the title of 'populist' for their own particular subject-matter without worrying about what this leaves out.^^ The most explicit adoption of a selective procedure is, however, that of Peter Wiles, who leaves out the Narodniki, justifying his exclusion thus: 'The Russians are . . . neither a prototype nor an archetype. If the concept of populism is to have general meaning and application it is the Russians, and not everyone else, who must be fitted upon the Procrustes' bed of definition.'^^ Having got rid of these awkward customers. Wiles is able to describe a populist 'syndrome' of linked tendencies and attitudes characteristic of populist movements, including anti-intellectualism, hostility to financiers, sympathy for small business, organization of co-operatives, etc. His syndrome has considerable coherence, and covers a good many of the movements generally thought of as populist.'^ A theory would have to be quite exceptionally persuasive, however, to convince the academic world at this late stage that the Narodniki were not really populists.
The problem confronting users of Strategy A is that there is a trade-off between comprehensiveness and clarity. Either a theory is clear but excludes one or other of the cases that seem to demand coverage, or else it is so comprehensive that it includes not only all conceivable cases of populism, but also all other movements and ideas as well. Perhaps the most ambitious attempt to steer between the Scylla of ruthless exclusion and the Charybdis of swirling vagueness has been made by Ernesto Laclau, who starts from his own Latin American specialism but makes a real effort to allow for the diversity of populisms. He argues that the defining characteristic of populist movements is not that they all arise on the basis of a particular class or at a particular stage in social development, but rather that they articulate 'a specific non-class contradiction'. Alongside the 'class contradictions' of all societies, according to Laclau, runs another 'objective contradiction', that between 'people' and 'power bloc', which gives rise to its own ideological vocabulary: 'Populism Starts at the point where popular-democratic elements are presented as an antagonistic option against the ideology of the dominant bloc'.""^°
Laclau's New Left jargon is obscure, but what he appears to be suggesting is that the defining characteristic of populism in all its varieties is that it mobilizes the antagonism of 'the people' against the established order, drawing for this purpose on rhetorical traditions of popular protest that exist virtually everywhere in different forms. Occasional use of anti-elitist rhetoric is not enough to make its users populists, according to Laclau: in order to qualify, leaders or parties must present a genuine challenge to the established authority when they mobilize the people. Challenges of this kind can, however, be mounted by all sorts of groups, even dissident sections of a ruling class, all
drawing on parallel traditions of popular antagonism to the state:
So we see why it is possible to call Hitler, Mao and Peron simultaneously populist. Not because the social bases of their movements were similar; not because their ideologies expressed the same class interests but because popular interpellations appear in the ideological discourses of all of them, presented in the form of antagonism.^^
This line of argument is an interesting one because it offers a criterion of populism which might be fiexible enough to take in the wide variety of phenomena generally given the name. Like others who use Strategy A, however, Laclau is not content to provide merely a criterion of populism: he wants to provide an explanation as well. Consequently, having first stressed the variety of populisms, he goes on to claim that they are systematically related to socio- economic conditions, in two ways. These two supposed relations turn out to suffer from the now familiar defects of Strategy A: one is too broad and vague, the other too restrictive.
Laclau maintains in the first place that popuhsm in all its varieties emerges during 'a crisis of the dominant ideological discourse, which is in turn part of a more general social crisis'^^—one of those sociological formulas which are so vague that one is hard put to imagine a situation they would not cover. Secondly, he argues that the specific form populism takes depends upon the class or complex of classes by which 'popular-democratic interpellations' are adopted. While his own application of this formula to the case of Peronism is persuasive, no such class-based approach will cover all relevant phenomena. He wants to claim, for example, that the proletariat is the only class that can fully develop 'the ""people""/power bloc contradiction', and genuinely aim at 'the suppression of the State as an antagonistic force with respect to the people'.^^ This blatantly ignores non-proletarian movements for populist democracy, for example the US Progressives' movement for initiative, referendum and reform, which was not socialist and did not have the kind of class base Laclau's theory demands.
Ill
I hope I have shown that in spite of its intuitive attractiveness, the use of Strategy A has not done much to clarify the confusions surrounding the notion of populism. We do not possess an acceptable theoretical account, and the failure of attempts to generate one suggests that there is not enough common ground among 'populist' phenomena to make such an account possible.^''' There is, however, another way of achieving greater clarity, namely the use of Strategy B.
The distinctive feature of this strategy is that it is phenomenological.^^ That is to say that whereas Strategy A in all its forms looks at the movements and ideas concerned with a view to their comprehension in a theory. Strategy B demands abstention from such theoretical ambitions. Instead, we must pay close attention to the phenomena known as 'populist' as these appear in the literature of social science and history. Given the highly contingent manner in which many of them have acquired the label, we must not assume in advance that they all share common features. An open-minded study of them can, however, enable us to construct a descriptive typology which clarifies the ways in which the term is used while being spacious enough to do justice to the diversity of the movements and ideas concerned.
It is important to be clear about what this strategy can and cannot achieve, for it is at the same time ambitious and modest. It is ambitious in that it aims to tidy up the chaotic field of populism into a clear typology. The modesty of the project lies in the kind of typology attempted. Unlike Strategy A, this approach cannot be expected to yield a theory with pretensions to say what are the essential features of populism, or why and under what conditions it will occur. If we look at the whole range of things currently given the name in the literature of social science, and note the clusters of comparable material, we can set up categories to accommodate their diversity: but the categories in such a typology are related to one another contingently, not tied into a grand theoretical structure.
A phenomenological typology of populisms is a much less exciting affair than a theory of populism, and may strike some readers as disappointingly ungainly and pedestrian. The main argument in its favour is that attempts at an acceptable theory have failed for reasons which make success in the future seem unhkely.
I have attempted elsewhere the actual construction of such a typology, and have argued that the range of phenomena covered by the term's use requires seven general categories of populisms.-^^ These can be briefly indicated as follows:
(1) Farmers Radicalism: movements with a social base among commodity farmers, favouring radical economic measures by a people's government: classically, the US Populist movement of the 1890s, but also Social Credit in Alberta, the CCF in Saskatchewan.
(2) Revolutionary Intellectual Populism: movements among revolutionary intellectuals aiming at agrarian socialism, idealizing the peasantry and trying to short-circuit Western (and orthodox Marxist) models of economic development. Classically, the Narodniki of nineteenth-century Russia, but
there are parallels in the recent Third World, e.g. Fanon, Nyerere.
(3) Peasant Populism: grassroots peasant movements for 'land and liberty', favQuring small property, co-operatives and traditionalism against capital- ists, bureaucrats and socialists: e.g. the Bulgarian Agrarian National Union and the other peasant parties involved in the 'Green' movement in Europe
between the two world wars.
(4) Populist Dictatorship: charismatic leaders who owe their power to their
ability to play upon the masses: e.g. Juan Peron, Huey Long, and other
successful demagogues.
(5) Populist Democracy: schemes and movements for making governments
directly responsive to the people, notably by means of such methods as the popular initiative, referendum, and recall: e.g. the American Progressives and their constitutional innovations; the Swiss system of direct democracy.
(6) Reactionary Populism: exploitation of the gulf between educated and progressive opinion and the views of the reactionary populace, notably on such matters as ethnic hostilities: e.g. George Wallace, Enoch Powell.
(7) Politicians' Populism: the use of calculatedly vague notions of 'the people' by catch-all parties or leaders who wish to blur established political divisions or to appeal away from politics altogether: e.g. de Gaulle, Jimmy Carter, many leaders of one-party states.
It is immediately apparent that this typology is in no sense a theory of populism: it does not tell us what, if any, are the essential characteristics of populism, nor does it propose any explanation for its occurrence or its variations. Instead, the typology is a tidying-up operation, designed to sort out and classify the range of populisms referred to in the current literature. While its main purpose and claim to justification is precisely this job of classification, however, certain theoretical implications do emerge as by-products.
In the first place, the types of populism covered by the scheme differ so much from one another that it no longer seems surprising that scholars have had so much difficulty in trying to define populism or to construct a coherent theory accounting for its varieties. Our seven populisms do not really look like seven varieties of the same kind of thing: on the contrary, some of them seem quite unconnected with others.
On the other hand, if our typology shows us why a theory of populism has proved so elusive, it also shows why the idea of constructing one should have seemed so plausible, for there are many interconnections and overlaps between the categories. US Populism, for instance, was not just a case of Farmers' Radicalism; it was also the bearer of an energetic campaign for Populist Democracy that later spilled over into the Progressive Movement.^^ While links of this kind are possible, however, they are not inevitable. The combination of agrarian radicalism and populist democracy in the US Populist movement may seem natural enough, but it is nevertheless contingent,^® and not a sound basis on which to generalize. It is clear that there is no ideology, economic programme, social base or political style common to all seven types. The only thing they all share is (as Ernesto Laclau has suggested) a common rhetoric. Populist rhetoric is anti- eUtist, exalts 'the people', and stresses the pathos of the 'little man'. When such symbols are cashed out in real political situations, however, the embodiments of the common man and his enemies turn out to be bewilderingly diverse. Populist rhetoric is compatible with all kinds of different social bases and economic interests, with ideologies of different kinds or with lack of ideology altogether."

"as a foreign policy analysis expert, explain this in detail. do it in a discoursive way following the authors train, clearly marking all the theories and theorists presented/cited: The ‘globalisation’ of the world economy and, increasingly, the extension of international rules and norms, have had a significant impact on
states. This phenomenon has inspired the emergence of a new form of international conduct – one which James Rosenau , as cited in Alden
and Aran (2017), calls ‘linkage politics’ – that involves both a diffusion
of state power and the rise of intergovernmental organisations and non-state actors. In this context, states are no longer seen as the sole providers of ideas and influence in the international system, but rather as working in tandem with intergovernmental organisations and non-state actors to address global issues. Moreover, domestic politics within states is increasingly influenced by ideas and actors outside of the traditional sphere of local politics (Peter Gourevitch’s ‘second image reversed’, as cited in Alden and Aran (2017)). Against this background of international change, a key question facing foreign policy analysis (FPA) scholars is to determine the degree to which transnationalism challenges the role of
the state in international affairs or merely serves as a new instrument for reinforcing its status. This chapter examines the roles and impacts of both state-created intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) and non-state actors on foreign policy. It explores how IGOs, such as the United Nations (UN) and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), provide platforms for state interaction, potentially increasing cooperation and stability despite inherent state desires for autonomy. The analysis also extends to non- state actors, ranging from multinational corporations like Exxon to non- governmental organisations (NGO) like Greenpeace, and their growing influence in global affairs through norm entrepreneurship and advocacy. The chapter also discusses key concepts like complex interdependence to explain how these diverse entities interact within the anarchic international system to shape policy outcomes, reflecting a multifaceted approach to understanding global governance and foreign policy dynamics. Intergovernmental organisations (also referred to more specifically as international institutions) are created by states to facilitate commerce
and communication, to provide for peace and security through collective action and to distribute governing capabilities among member states. Their presence ameliorates conflict between states and, in so doing, induces
a measure of stability in the otherwise anarchic system. According to realists, international institutions remain the instruments of states while other scholars have emphasised the degree to which they are able to establish a measure of autonomy.
This debate over the rationale behind state participation in intergovernmental organisations and the effect that it has on state and international organisational interests is central to our understanding of
the relationship between states, their foreign policy aims and the influence of international institutions over these aims. State engagement with international institutions is predicated on the desire to participate in global
 72 multilateral institutions, despite the obvious surrendering of some state prerogatives. Though some International Relations (IR) scholars have focused on the short-term interests that drive state engagement, others have emphasised the longer-term gains for participating states. IR scholars believe that such long-term state participation offers tools of influence to the (international) organisation because it allows for policy proposals that are closer to the organisation’s interests than to the state’s.
In this setting, the capacity of states to exercise influence over the international agenda is under several important constraints. For example, institutional rules and procedures introduce barriers to direct action
and require consultation as well as consensus among member states as
a precursor to policy formulation. Norms like the sovereign equality of states, though deliberately violated in the structuring of the Permanent Five in the UN Security Council as well as the system of weighted voting in the IMF, nonetheless introduce checks on major power influence
in international institutions at the same time as they amplify middle
and small power roles. Under these conditions, foreign policy making becomes deeply enmeshed in coalition-building strategies which, echoing the insights of group decision-making within states, tends to produce sub-optimal policies from the perspective of all participants. However, proponents would argue, the emergent system of ‘global governance’
lays the foundation for a stable, rules-based international order that will ultimately transcend the anarchy of the past. Non-state actors, broadly construed, are all categories of political actors involved in international affairs that are neither states nor representative of state-created bodies or intergovernmental organisations. They vary
in classification from large multinational corporations like Exxon,
with a global presence and huge financial resources at hand, to small environmental lobby groups like Greenpeace, with a global media presence and representative offices around the world. More recently, the recognition that globalisation has been accompanied by a rise in criminal transnational actors like Al Qaeda has further expanded this category.
Christopher Hill makes the following distinction between different non- state actors (or transnational actors, as he prefers to call them): territorial, using or seeking a territorial base; ideological/cultural, promoting ideas across boundaries; and economic, whose primary focus is wealth creation. They relate to states in three ways – through bargaining and negotiation, as competitors and in the form of transcending relations. An example
of the first kind of relationship is an environmental NGO that hopes to influence government policy using different forms of persuasion that
is routinised through regular interaction between the two entities. An example of the second kind of relationship is that of a human rights group that challenges a state’s treatment of its citizens and may even provoke
a hostile response from the state apparatus. Finally, an example of the third kind of relationship is that of actors such as churches, who do not necessarily even use the state as a reference point, either to influence
or compete against, in the pursuit of their transnational activities like missionary work (Hill, 2003, pp.193–205).
Historically, the impact of non-state actors on foreign policy was first seen in the 19th century over the abolition of the slave trade, when (primarily) churches and church-affiliated organisations in England led by William Wilberforce made common cause with like-minded individuals across the British Empire, North America and elsewhere. Trade unions promoted solidarity and labour rights among industrialised countries and, in the 20th century, in the developing world. Political movements lobbied for civil rights in the colonial territories during the 20th century and, in some instances, embarked on campaigns of political violence against states. More recently, the triumph of democratic liberalism that accompanied the end of the Cold War laid the basis for a proliferation of non-state actors who use new communication technologies such as the internet to promote their interests and concerns.
Central to the discussion of how contemporary non-state actors, and in particular advocacy groups, influence foreign policy is the place of ‘norms’. Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink (1998), IR scholars, propose
a schema for understanding how non-state actors are able to influence foreign policy by focusing on the role of ‘norm entrepreneurs’. Norm entrepreneurs attempt to introduce new ideas that are linked to existing norms and hold out the possibility of greater effectiveness and acceptance by state actors. The diffusion of norms follows a pattern (or ‘life cycle’) characterised by norm emergence, a ‘tipping point’, norm cascade and ultimately norm internalisation by state actors. The tipping point or threshold is especially important as it is the moment when a sufficient number of states as well as influential states have accepted the norm, thus paving the way for general acceptance by all states in the international system. Conflicts between international and domestic norms do occur
and are influenced by international trends that can act to discredit one constellation of norms, thus allowing another to replace it.
For example, in Southern Africa, the discrediting of racial narratives which informed settler colonialism played a crucial role in undermining support for settler oligarchies both internationally and domestically, as did the collapse of communism in paving the way for transitions to democracy.
Also important to consider is the motivation for acceptance of new norms by state actors. According to Finnemore and Sikkink, governing élites respond to norms when their legitimacy is threatened, when prominent states abide by a particular norm, for the intrinsic (usually universalistic) qualities of the norm, and when the new norms can claim ties to existing norms. The centrality of local norm entrepreneurs to the process of extending the reach of international – indeed, Western – norms to non- Western polities such as those in Southern Africa introduces a level of local agency that holds implications for acceptance of these ‘outside’ norms.
Amitav Acharya (2018) notes that sociocultural factors such as belief systems influence the degree to which resistance, adaptation and adoption, or replacement strategies are employed by local actors in Southeast Asia. Against this backdrop of growing global interdependence, Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye (1998) sought to understand how these changes in turn affect the dynamics of foreign policy decision-making. For them, the
web of interconnections between state, sub-state and non-state actors produces a foreign policy process characterised by a multiplicity of
actors, channels and inputs, which produces new agendas and outcomes. In particular, they felt that the globalising world elevated the status of international organisations because of their recognised role as the key site of cooperation and coalition building for states. Keohane and Nye suggest that the process of foreign policy formulation under conditions of complex interdependency is influenced by the following factors.
  The goals of actors: these vary from issue to issue for states, and multiple channels of contact between governments (e.g. ministry-to- ministry) make goals difficult to define. Transnational actors pursue their own goals.
• Instruments of state policy: power resources specific to issue areas are most relevant and state actors’ attempts to manipulate
• interdependence to promote national agendas, using international organisations and transnational actors as alternative instruments of foreign policy where they can.
• Agenda formation: the policy agenda is affected by changes
in the distribution of power resources within issue areas, the
status of international regimes, changes in the importance of transnational actors, linkages to other issues and politicisation due to interdependence.
• Roles of international organisations: these bodies ultimately set the international agenda, induce coalition formation among state actors and act as arenas for political action for states (but especially for weak states).
In this account, the centrality of the state is diluted by the international organisation and, to a degree, other transnational actors, but it remains a key player in the process. At the same time, this model of the foreign policy process does not address defining issues such as the matter of institutional autonomy of international organisations from states or thedifferent distributions in state power (major, middle and small/weak) and how this affects their aims, input and outcome.
Rosenau’s ‘linkage politics’, which describes the process by which the classic division between state and international is being eroded, is
further realised through ‘linkage actors’. These include governments as negotiators, international organisations as agenda setters, international courts penetrating domestic legal systems, transgovernmental coalitions which act collectively when states are unable or unwilling to, and NGOs and epistemic communities. According to Karns and Mingst (2004), these linkage actors adopt one of four strategies to influence foreign policy. These are:
• a power approach targeting top decision-makers
• a technocratic approach using knowledge of the procedural mechanisms of the international system to gain influence
• a coalition-building approach which utilises domestic actors to create consensus that ultimately forms part of a transnational coalition
• grassroots mobilisation targeting the public of different states to generate support for their foreign policy aim. This chapter examined how the rise of transnational actors as increasingly important players in world politics reflects the dramatic changes experienced by the globalising international system in the last few decades. From the perspective of FPA, the challenge is to determine how significant this phenomenon is when faced with either the methodological difficulties in ascribing causality to the lobbying efforts of non-state actors in actually influencing the foreign policy choices of states or the problem of assessing the institutional autonomy of international institutions from states. Ultimately, an analysis of the significance of transnational actors is dependent upon an appraisal of state power and the relationship of each state to these new entities. In the next chapter, we will pick up the theme of change in the international system and its impact on foreign policy by examining how regime change in states themselves affects their foreign policy."

Discussing witch-hunting as a global phenomenon, at the end of Caliban and the Witch (2004), and commenting on the witch-hunts that have taken place in Africa and other parts of the world in the 1980s and 1990s, I expressed my concern that these persecutions were rarely reported in Europe and the U.S. Today, the literature on the return of witch-hunting on the world scene has grown and so have media reports of witch-killings, coming not only from Africa, but India, Latin America, Papua New Guinea. Yet, with few exceptions,2 social justice movements and even feminist organizations continue to be silent on this matter, although the victims are predominantly women.
By witch-hunting I refer to the recurrence of punitive expeditions by young male vigilantes or self-appointed witch-finders, often leading to the murder of the accused and the confiscation of their properties. Especially in Africa, this has become a serious problem over the last two decades continuing to this day. Just in Kenya, eleven people, eight women and three men, were murdered in May in the Southwestern province of Kisii, accused of witchcraft (USA Africa Dialogue 5/24/08).
Studied mostly by anthropologists, witchcraft accusations and killings should concern all feminists, North and South. For in addition to inflicting an unspeakable suffering on those accused, and perpetrating a misogynous ideology that degrades all women, they have devastating consequences for the communities affected, especially the younger generations. They are also emblematic examples of the effects of economic globalization on women, further demonstrating that it contributes to the escalation of male violence against them.
In what follows, I discuss the witch-hunts in Africa, examining their motivations and suggesting some initiatives that feminists can take to put an end to these persecutions. My argument is that these witch-hunts must be understood in the context of the deep crisis in the process of social reproduction that the liberalization and globalization of African economies have produced, as they have undermined local economies, devalued women's social position, and generated intense conflicts between young and old, women and men, over the use of crucial economic resources starting with land. In this sense, I see the present witch-hunts on a continuum with such phenomena as the dowry murders and the return of sati in India, and the killings of hundreds of women in the Mexican towns at the border with the U.S., victims of rapists or snuff/porno producers. For, in different ways, they too are an expression of the effects of ""integration"" into the global economy, and men's readiness to vent on women their economic frustrations and even sacrifice their lives to keep abreast of advancing capitalist relations. These witch-hunts are also on a continuum with the worldwide return of ""the supernatural"" in political discourse and popular practice (e.g. ""satanic cults"" in Europe and the U.S.), a phenomenon that can be attributed to the proliferation of fundamentalist religious sects but, significantly, has emerged in conjunction with the globalization of economic life.
My analysis concludes that while mobilizing against these egregious violations of women‟s rights, feminists should put on trial the agencies that have created the material and social conditions that have made them possible. These include the African governments who do not intervene to prevent the killings or punish them; the World Bank, the International Monetary Find and their international supporters, whose economic policies have destroyed local economies, fueling a war of all against all. Most crucially, feminist should put on trial the United Nations, which pays lip service to women‟s rights but treats economic liberalization as a Millennium goal, and watches in silence while old women, in many parts of the world, are demonized, expelled from their communities, or cut to pieces or burnt alive.
Witch-Hunting and Globalization in Africa from the 1980s to Present
Although the fear of witchcraft is often described as a deep-seated feature of Africa‟s belief systems,3 assaults on 'witches' have intensified across Africa in the 1990s in ways unprecedented in the pre-colonial period. Figures are difficult to come by, since attacks and killings have often gone unpunished and unrecorded. But what is available shows the magnitude of the problem.
One thousand women are now exiled in “witches camps” in the North of Ghana, forced to flee their communities under the threat of death (Berg 2005). At least three hundred people were killed, between 1992 and 1994, in the Gusii (Kisii) district of Southwestern Kenya, the attackers being well-organized groups of young men, acting under the directives of relatives of the victims or other interested parties (Ogembo 2006). Intense persecutions have occurred in South Africa‟s Northern province, after the end of apartheid, with such a heavy toll in human lives that the African National Congress “saw it necessary, among its first gestures in government, to appoint a commission of inquiry” on the matter (Comaroff and Comaroff 1999: 282). Routine assaults on “witches,” often with deadly consequences, have been recorded in Nigeria, Cameroon, Tanzania, Namibia, and Mozambique. According to one account, between 1991 and 2001, at least 23,000 “witches” have been killed in Africa, the figure being considered a conservative one (Petraitis 2003). “Cleansing” campaigns have also been launched, with witch-finders going from village to village, submitting everyone to humiliating and frightening interrogations and exorcisms. This has been the case in Zambia, where, in one of the districts of Central Province, one hundred and seventy-six witch-finders were active in the summer of 1997, and, since then, witch-hunts ""have proceeded unabated,"" with the accused driven out of their villages, expropriated of their possessions, often tortured and killed (Hinfelaar 2007: 233).
In most instances, witch-hunters have operated with impunity. Police forces often side with them, or refuse to arrest them, not to be accused of protecting witches or because they cannot find people who testify against them. Governments too have watched from the sidelines. Except for the government of South Africa, none has seriously investigated the circumstance of these killings. More surprising, feminists have not spoken up against them. They fear, perhaps, that denouncing these witch-hunts may promote colonial stereotypes of Africans as a population mired in backwardness and irrationality. Such fears are not unfounded but they are misguided. Witch-hunts are not just an African but a global problem. They are part of a worldwide pattern of increasing violence against women that we need to combat. Thus, we need to understand the forces and social dynamics responsible for them.
It is important to stress, in this context, that anti-witchcraft movements only began in Africa in the colonial period, in conjunction with the introduction of cash economies that profoundly changed social relations creating new forms of inequality.4 Prior to colonization, ""witches"" were at times punished but rarely killed; in fact, it is even questionable whether we can speak of 'witchcraft,' when referring to pre-colonial times, since the term was not used until the coming of the Europeans.
It was in the 1980s and 1990s that--together with the debt crisis, structural adjustment, currency devaluation-- the fear of “witches” became a dominant concern in many African communities, so much so that ""even ethnic groups...who had no knowledge of witchcraft before colonial time today believe to have witches in their midst"" (Danfulani 2007: 181).
Why this resurgence of a persecution in some ways reminiscent of the European 17th century witch-hunts? This is a difficult question to answer, if we wish to go beyond the immediate causes. The situation is complicated by the fact that there are evidently different types of motives behind the charge of witchcraft. A witchcraft accusation can be the result of a land conflict or of economic rivalries and competitions, or it can mask the refusal to support family or community members that are seen as a drain on its resources, or can be a devise to justify the enclosures of communal lands.
What is certain, however, is that we will not find an explanation for this phenomenon by appealing to the “African worldview.” Similarly, the view that witchcraft accusations are leveling mechanisms used to defend communal values against the excessive accumulation of wealth, can hardly account for these persecutions, given their destructive consequences for African communities. More convincing is the view that these witch-hunts are not a legacy of the past, but are a response to the social crisis that globalization and neo-liberal restructuring of Africa‟s political economies have produced.
A detailed analysis of the ways in which economic globalization has created an environment conducive to witchcraft accusations is provided by Justus Ogembo's ""Contemporary Witch-hunting in Gusii, Southwestern Kenya"" (2006: 111ff.). Describing a situation that is duplicated in countries across the continent, Ogembo argues that structural adjustment programs and trade liberalization have so destabilized African communities, so undermined their reproductive system and thrown households into such ""deprivation and despair"" that many people have come to believe that they are the victims of evil conspiracies, carried out by supernatural means (2006: 125). He points out that, after Kenya ""adjusted"" its economy, unemployment reached unprecedented levels, the currency was devalued, so that basic commodities became unavailable, state-subsidies to basic services, like education, health, public transport, were gutted.
In short, millions of people, in rural and urban areas, found themselves with their backs against the wall, unable to provide for their families and communities and no hopes for the future. Rising mortality rates, especially among children, due to the collapse of the healthcare system, growing malnutrition, and the spread of AIDS, contributed to fuel suspicions of foul play. Ogembo (2006) argues that the persecution of witches was further instigated by the proliferation of fundamentalist sects, re-injecting into religion the fear of the devil, and by the appearance of self-defined ""traditional healers,"" exploiting people's inability to pay hospital fees and hiding their incompetence behind appeals to the supernatural.
Ogembo's (2006) analysis is shared by many scholars. But other aspects of economic globalization are noted that provide a context for understanding the new surge of witch-hunting. One view is that witch beliefs are being manipulated to justify expropriating people from their land. In some areas of post-war Mozambique, for instance, women, who after their husbands died, insisted on holding on to the couple's land, have been accused of being witches by the relatives of the deceased (Bonate 2003: 11, 74, 115). Others were accused when refusing to give up the land that they had rented during the war (Gengenback 1998).5 Land disputes are at the origins also of many accusations in Kenya. In both countries, land scarcity adds to the intensity of the conflicts.
More broadly, witch-craft accusations are often a means of enclosure. As international agencies, with the African governments, press for the privatization and alienation of communal lands, witchcraft accusations become a powerful means to break the resistance of those to be expropriated. As historian Hugo Hinfelaar points out, with reference to Zambia:
In the current era of uncontrolled „market forces' as preached by the present government and other supporters of neo-liberalism, confiscating land and other forms of property has taken on a more sinister dimension. It has been noted that witchcraft accusations and cleansing rituals are particularly rife in areas earmarked for game management and game ranching, for tourism, and for occupation by potential big landowners ... Some chiefs and headmen profit from selling considerable portions of their domain to international investors, and fomenting social disruption in the village facilitates the transaction. A divided village will not have the power to unite and oppose attempts to having the land they cultivate being taken over by someone else. As a matter of fact, the villagers are at times, so engaged in accusing each other of practicing witchcraft that they hardly notice that they are being dispossessed and they have turned into squatters on their own ancestral lands. (Hinfelaar 2007: 238)
Another source of witchcraft accusations is the increasingly mysterious character of economic transactions and people's consequent inability to understand the forces that govern their lives (Ogembo 2006: ix). As local economies are transformed by international policies and the ""invisible hand"" of the global market, it becomes difficult for people to understand what motivates economic change and why some prosper while others are pauperized. The result is a climate of mutual resentment and suspicion, in which those who benefit from economic liberalization fear being bewitched by those impoverished, and the poor, many of them women, see the wealth from which they are excluded as a product of evil arts. Witches, Parish (2000) writes, are personified in the eyes of Nigerian urban dwellers by the greedy villagers who strip them of their wealth. In turn, the villagers use witchcraft accusations against the urban elite to enforce fading kinship norms concerning standards of mutual support (Parish ibid.; Geschiere 1998; Van Binsbergen 2007).
Witch hunting is also attributed to the anxiety caused by the proliferation of “occult economies” resulting from the global deregulation of economic activity and the quest for new forms of business. The traffic in organs and body parts, to be used in transplants or rituals associated with the acquisition of wealth, have spread in Africa as other parts of the world, generating a fear that evil forces are sapping people‟s life energies and humanity. In this sense, witchcraft accusations --like the vampire stories in colonial Africa that Louise White has studied (White 2000)6-- can be seen as a response to the commodification of life and capitalism‟s attempt not only to reactivate slave labor but to turn human bodies themselves into means of accumulation (Comaroff and Comaroff 1999: 281-85).
While multiple factors have combined to produce a climate in which the fear of witches thrives, there is consensus that at the root of the witch-hunts is a fierce struggle for survival that takes the form of an intergenerational struggle. It is young men, often unemployed, who provide the manpower for the witch-hunts, although often executing plans hatched by other actors who remain in the shadow. They are the ones who go from house to house to collect the money needed to pay a witch-finder or ambush and execute the accused. With no possibility of going to school, no prospect of making a living off the land or finding other forms of income, unable to fulfill their roles as family providers, many young men, in today's structurally adjusted Africa, despair about their future, and are easily led to war against their communities (Alidou 2007).7 Often hired and trained as mercenaries by politicians, rebel armies, private companies, or the state, they are ready to organize punitive expeditions, especially against old people whom they blame for their misfortunes and see as a burden as well as an obstacle to their wellbeing. It is in this context, that (in the words of an old Congolese man) “the youth represent a [constant threat] for us oldsters” (African Agenda, 1999: 35).
Thus, older folks returning to their villages with the savings of a lifetime have found themselves charged as witches and expropriated from their houses and earnings, or worse, have been killed -- hanged, buried or burned alive (African Agenda, 1999: 35). In 1996 alone, the Congolese Human Rights Monitoring Commission “recorded about 100 case where elderly people, accused of witchcraft, were hung” (ibid). Pensioners have been a common target also in Zambia, where “village leaders are believed to be conspiring with witch-finders to strip [them] of the assets they have acquired over the years,” prompting a newspaper article to comment that “Retiring, going back home has become a risky business!” (Hinfelaar 2007: 236). In rural Limpopo, South Africa, young men have burnt old women alive, accusing them of turning dead people into zombies in order to get slaves, ghost workers and deprive the youth of work (Comaroff and Comaroff 1999: 285). Meanwhile, in the DRC (Democratic Republic of the Congo), and, more recently, in Eastern Nigeria, children too have been accused of being demonic. The charges have come from Christian exorcists or ""traditional witch doctors,"" who make a living by inflicting on them all kinds of tortures under on the pretext of cleansing their bodies from the evil spirits that possess them. Thousands of children have been tortured in this way, also in Angola, with the complicity of their parents probably eager to free themselves from youngsters they can no longer support. Many children have been thrown into the streets--more than 14,000 just in Kinshasa-or have been killed (Vine 1999, McVeigh 2007, La Franiere 2007).
It is important here to again stress the role by the many religious sects (Pentecostal, Zionist) that over the last twenty years have proselytized in urban and rural Africa. Of Pentacostalism Ogembo writes that: ""with its emphasis on exorcism...[it] has preyed on the Gusii indigenous beliefs about mystical forces and powers, forcing the two major denominations in Gusiland to reexamine their doctrines on the same."" (Ogembo 2006 :109). He adds that through books, open-air sermons in market centers and other public spaces, evangelists have increased people's anxiety about the Devil, preaching a connection between Satan, illness, and death. The media has helped in this process, a sign that the new “witch-craze” is not a purely spontaneous development. Streams of programs are daily broadcast in Ghana describing how witches operate and how they can be identified. Witch-Hunting as Women Hunting
As we have seen, the recent witch-hunts have spared no one. However, as in the European witch-hunts, those most frequently and violently attacked have been older women. In Ghana, they have been so much at risk that “witches camps” have been created, where those accused live in exile, after being expelled from their villages, at times, moving there ""voluntarily"" when they are past the child-bearing age, or remain alone, and feel vulnerable to attacks (Dovlo 2007: 77; Berg 2005).8 Older women were also the majority of the victims in the Gusii witch-hunts of 1992-1995. The men murdered there were guilty of association with suspected witches or were killed in their stead, when the women could not be found or they tried to protect them (Ogembo 2006: 21). Women are the main victims in the Congo, South Africa, Zambia, and Tanzania. Most are farmers, often living alone. But in urban areas, it is traders who are more commonly attacked, as men respond to the loss of economic security and masculine identity, by discrediting women they see or believe to be competing with them. Thus, in Northern Ghana female traders have been accused of gaining their wealth by turning souls into commodities (Dovlo 2007: 83). In Zambia, those at risk are independent women, “who frequently travel as entrepreneurs and smugglers along the national highways” (Auslander 1993: 172).
There are witch-finders who accuse women because they have red eyes, which they claim is a sign of women‟s devilish nature, though ""it is a common condition in rural Africa, where women spend year toiling in smoky kitchens cooking for their families"" (Petraitis 2003: 2).
What is taking place, then, is a broad attack on women, reflecting a dramatic devaluation of their position and identity. “Traditional” patriarchal prejudices certainly play a role in it. Shaped by male-centered religious values, indigenous as well as grafted on them by colonization, African cultures picture women as more jealous, vindictive and secretive than men and more predisposed to evil forms of witchcraft (Dovlo 2007: ibid). The fact that women are in charge of the reproduction of their families magnifies men's fear of their powers. Interviewed by Alison Berg, the male keeper of a witch camp was explicit on this point. Witches - he said - are women because it is women who cook for men! Nevertheless, patriarchal views of femininity do not explain the explosion of misogyny these witch-hunts represent. This becomes evident when we consider the cruelty of the punishments, all the more shocking as they are inflicted on old women and in communities where old age has always commanded great respect. With reference to the witch-hunts in Gusii, Ogembo describes how
[v]illagers rounded up and „arrested‟ suspects in their houses at night or chased them and caught them like prey by day, bound their hands and feet with sisal ropes, torched them--after dousing them with gasoline purchased earlier or placing them under grass-thatched roofs--and then drew back to watch the victims agonize and perish in the flames. Some of those murdered in this way left behind a terrified and now orphaned offspring. (Ogembo 2006: 1)
It is reckoned that thousands of women have been burned or buried alive or have been beaten and tortured to death. In Ghana, children have been encouraged to stone the old women accused. Indeed, we could not explain such brutality if we did not have historical precedents, and more recent examples coming from other parts of our “global village” like India or Papua.
The historical comparison that comes to mind is the witch-hunts that took place in Europe from the 15th to the 18th century that sent hundreds of thousands of women to the stake. This is a precedent that scholars of the African witch-hunts do not like to acknowledge because of the immensely different historical and cultural contexts. Furthermore, unlike the European witch-hunts, those in Africa or India today are not the work of magistrates, kings and popes. Nevertheless, they share important elements with the witch-hunts in Europe that cannot be denied and help us ""historicize"" them (Apter 1993: 97), also throwing light on witch-hunting as a disciplinary tool.
There are echoes of the European witch-hunts in the crimes of which the African witches are accused, that seem borrowed from the European demonologies, likely reflecting the influence of evangelization: night flights, shape shifting, cannibalism, the causing of sterility in women, infant deaths, the destruction of crops. In both cases, moreover, the ""witches"" are predominantly older women, poor farmers, often living alone or women believed to be competing with men. Most important, like the European witch- hunts, the new witch-hunts in Africa are taking place in societies that are undergoing a process of ""primitive accumulation,"" where many farmers are forced off the land, new property relations and concepts of value-creation are coming into place, and under the impact of economic strain communal solidarity breaks down.
As I have argued in Caliban and the Witch: Women, the Body and Primitive Accumulation (2004), it is not a coincidence that under these circumstances, women, older ones in particular, should suffer a process of social degradation and become the target of a gender war. In part, as we have seen, this war can be traced to young people's reluctance in a time of diminishing resources to support their kin folks and to their eagerness to appropriate their belongings, insignificant as they may be. But most crucial is the fact that when monetary relations become hegemonic, women's reproductive activities, and their contribution to the community are totally ""devalued."" This is especially true of old women who can no longer provide children or sexual services and therefore are even more resented as a drain on the creation of wealth.
There is a significant parallel here between the attack on old African female rural farmers perpetrated through witchcraft accusations and the ideological campaign the World Bank has been mounting across the continent to promote the commercialization of land, which claims that land is a ""dead asset,"" as long as is used as a means of livelihood and shelter, for land becomes productive only when brought as collateral for credit to the bank (Manji 2007). I would argue that many old women and men in Africa today are hunted as witches because they too are seen as ""dead assets,"" the embodiment of a world of practices and values that is increasingly considered sterile, non-productive.
In making this point, I do not intend to minimize the importance of the complex of grievances, old and new, that in each instance produce witchcraft accusations. Old rumors, compounded by mysterious deaths especially of children, the desire to appropriate coveted properties (sometimes just a radio or TV), anger against adulterous behavior, above all land disputes or simply the decision to force people off the land, are the daily substance of the African persecutions, as they were in the witch-hunts in Europe. The structure of the polygamous family contribute to foment witchcraft accusations, creating jealousies and competition among co-wives and siblings with regard to the distribution of the family‟s assets, especially land. Thus, stepmothers and co-wives figure prominently among the women accused. Growing land scarcity intensifies these conflicts, for husbands now find it difficult to provide for all their wives, thus causing intense rivalries among them and their children. In post-war Mozambique, as we have seen, the struggle over land has even brought women to accuse each other of witchcraft (Gengenbach 1998).
Yet, we cannot understand how such conflicts can instigate such cruel attacks on old women unless we place them on a broader canvass. This is the world of the disintegrating communal village economy, in which older women are those who most strenuously defend a non-capitalist use of natural resources -- practicing subsistence farming and refusing e.g. to sell their land or trees, to keep them for their children's security (Bonate 2003: 113)9 -- and where a generation of youngsters is growing whose minds have become unsettled because of the hardships they are facing, and are now convinced that older people can no longer provide for their future and, worse, are blocking their access to wealth. As Auslander writes, drawing on his experience in Ngoni land (Eastern Zambia), old men too are caught in this conflict between the values of the older subsistence-oriented communal world and those of the advancing monetary economy.
In popular songs and plays they lament that their children will poison them to sell their cattle for cash and to buy chemical fertilizer or a truck (1993: 181). But the “battle to make wealth” is “waged [above all] upon the mature female body” (ibid.,170) because old women are believed to pose a special threat to the reproduction of their communities, destroying crops, making young women barren, and hoarding what they have. In other words, the battle is waged on women‟s bodies because women are seen as the main agents of resistance to the expansion of the cash economy, and as such as useless individuals, selfishly monopolizing resources the youth could use. From this viewpoint, the present witch-hunts, no less than the ideology the World Bank promotes with regard to land, represent a complete perversion in the traditional conception of value creation, symbolized by the contempt the witch-hunters display for the bodies of older women, whom in Zambia they have at times derided as ""sterile vaginas.""
As we have seen, the elimination of aging female subsistence farmers is not the only motivation behind the attack perpetrated against African ""witches."" As in 16th century Europe, today as well, many men respond to the threat which the expansion of capitalist relations poses to their economic security and masculine identity, by discrediting the women they see or believe are competing with them. Thus, market women, a major social force in Africa, have been often accused of being witches, also thanks to national politicians who have blamed on them the high inflationary rates the liberalization of the economy has caused (Auslander 1993: 182).
But the attack on trading women also involves a clash between opposite systems of values. As reported by Parish (2000), in Ghana, witchcraft accusations develop in the clash between the values of the predominantly female village traders, who insist on returning the money they earn to the local economy and keeping it where they can see it, and those of the male businessmen involved in export/import trade who look at the world market as their economic horizon (Parish 2000). Sexual elements enter this scenario, as the same businessmen fear that witches can appropriate their bodies (beside their wallets) through their sexual arts (ibid). But the charge most often moved against ""witches"" is that they are sterile and produce sterility, both sexual and economic, in the people they bewitch (Auslander 1993: 179). ""Open the Wombs"" ""Open the Wombs,"" women were commanded in a rural community of Eastern Zambian during a witch-finding campaign in 1989, while accused of making people barren (ibid: 167). Meanwhile, their bodies were cut up with dozens of razor incisions in which a ""cleansing"" medicine was placed (ibid: 174).
Witch-hunting and Feminist Activism: Reconstructing the Commons
Considering the danger the African witch-hunts represent for women, the suffering they inflict, their violation of women's bodies and rights, we can only speculate why feminists have not spoken up and mobilized against them. Possibly, some may think that focussing on this issue may divert attention from broader political concerns like war, global debt, and environmental crises. As I mentioned, there may be also a reluctance to tackle this topic for fear of promoting a colonial image of Africans as a backward population. But the result is that it is mostly journalists and academics who have analyzed this persecution, and as a consequence it has been depoliticized. Most accounts are written in a detached mode, showing little outrage for the horrific destiny that so many of the accused have met. With the exception of the articles contained in Imagining Evil (2007), none of the reports I have read is written in an advocacy mode or to protest the indifference of national and international institutions to this butchery. Most anthropological analyses are concerned with demonstrating that the new witch-hunts are not a return to tradition, but Africans' way of negotiating the challenges of ""modernity."" Few have words of sympathy for the women, men and children who have been murdered. One anthropologist even collaborated with the persecutors. Over a period of months, he followed a witch-finder who was traveling from village to village in Zambia to exorcise those he identified as witches. He tape-record the entire exercise, though it was often so violent that he compared it to a RENAMO incursion, with people being insulted, terrified and cut up presumably to force the evil spirits out of their bodies. Then, to the witch- finder‟s satisfaction, the anthropologist turned over to him the photos he took, knowing that the witch-finder would use them to publicize his work (9).
Feminists' first contribution, then, should be to initiate a different type of scholarship, concerned with better understanding what social conditions produce witch- hunts, and with building a constituency (of human rights activists, social justice groups) committed to documenting, publicizing and ending the persecutions. Examples for this type of scholarship"
"help me make this essay introduction more scorrevole and structured, I want the structure to be  - definition/hook - thesis statement - essay plan : The concept of modernisation—the transition from traditional, agrarian societies to industrialised, capitalist ones (Grugel, 2002) —has evolved significantly over time. Traditionally, the path to modernity was closely linked to economic growth and measured through indicators such as GNI, GDP, and industrial output (Todaro and Smith, 2020). This perspective, embodied in modernisation theory, posits that economic development fosters democratic governance by creating social conditions conducive to political pluralism, middle-class expansion, and institutional stability. Prominent scholars such as Lipset, Rostow, and Parsons argue for a linear and deterministic relationship between rising wealth, literacy, urbanisation, and democratisation (Grugel, 2002). However, these assumptions have been increasingly challenged, with critics emphasizing the complex interplay of cultural, political, and historical factors in the democratisation process.  Although modernisation theory provides a useful framework for understanding the link between economic development and democracy, its deterministic outlook and economic-centric focus often oversimplify the complexities of political transitions. While economic growth can create favourable conditions for democracy, social structures, political institutions, and cultural dynamics play equally significant roles in shaping democratic outcomes. Thus, a more nuanced and multidimensional approach is necessary to fully capture the diverse pathways to democratisation. This essay will first examine the strengths of modernisation theory, highlighting its emphasis on economic growth as a driver of democratisation. It will then critically analyse its limitations by addressing economic, social, international, and demographic critiques that challenge its core assumptions. Finally, the essay will explore alternative perspectives that offer a more comprehensive understanding of the democratisation process."

"I think what I like about la voce di new york is tat they bring together my Italian side and the international side, and this idea of a newspaper of italians living abroad. can you put it together in a nice way for my cover letter: Dear La Voce di New York Editorial Team,
In March 2024, I launched The 4WORDER Magazine, a student-led publication designed to bring fresh perspectives to our academic community. Distributed as a newsletter with a 71% monthly open rate, this project taught me that people value ethically reported news that explains the significant impact of global events with empathy and human perspective. This is the kind of work La Voce di New York sustains, which is why I am excited to apply for a summer internship with your editorial team.
I am a second-year Italian student at Forward College, pursuing a degree in International Relations and Politics through a program designed by the London School of Economics that spans three cities—Lisbon, Paris, and Berlin. My academic focus on global affairs has driven my passion for breaking down complex international issues into accessible and engaging narratives—whether it’s analysing international relations, the geopolitics of climate change, or the cascading effects of global flashpoints. This passion led me to evolve The 4WORDER Magazine into The Grad Media, a free online platform dedicated to empowering aspiring writers and journalists. The Grad Media is a collaborative space where students across Europe can share their creative and journalistic work, but only after it has gone through a structured process of peer feedback. This unique approach not only ensures the quality of published content but also fosters networking, skill-building, and confidence among contributors. Our mission is to create a supportive community that emphasises collaboration, meaningful storytelling, and substance over headline-driven journalism.
As Editor-in-Chief, I lead a diverse team of 15 contributors, including writers, editors, and graphic designers, ensuring seamless collaboration to keep our editorial calendar on track for consistent weekly publications. I take an affirming, collaborative approach to bring out the best in each contributor, overseeing the politics section which presents global events in concise and balanced formats. In addition to guiding editorial vision, I contribute to the news and opinion sections, focusing on well-researched, underreported stories.

Beyond editorial work, I taught myself HTML and GitHub to build The Grad Media’s website from scratch, blending technical and creative skills to grow our audience. I’m also employing data-driven strategies to engage Gen-Z audiences across Lisbon, Paris, and Berlin, using targeted social media content, interactive stories, and collaborative initiatives to build a tangible network that our writers can rely on and connect with. This strategic approach was instrumental during my time at Samaritan Volunteers, where I created short, impactful Instagram narratives that helped raise nearly €2,000 within 10 days.
My perspective as a journalist has been profoundly shaped by a life lived across borders. Having called Canada, East Africa, and multiple European countries home, I bring a unique cross-cultural lens and nuance to my work, supported by fluency in English, Italian, and French, and beginner proficiency in Portuguese and Swahili. These experiences inform my storytelling, enabling me to approach narratives with nuance and empathy. Additionally, my time working in luxury showrooms for Tory Burch, Hugo Boss, and Givenchy honed my ability to thrive under pressure and maintain meticulous attention to detail—qualities I am eager to bring to the team.


At La Voce di New York, I see an opportunity to blend my academic expertise, editorial experience, and cross-cultural insights to contribute to journalism that transcends borders. Your commitment to amplifying voices from Italy and the international community deeply resonates with my goal of bringing underreported stories to light. I am particularly inspired by your dedication to highlighting the intersection of politics, culture, and identity—areas I am eager to contribute to with thoughtful and well-researched reporting.
Joining your team represents not just a chance to grow professionally but also to support a platform that aligns with my values of inclusivity, integrity, and global understanding. Thank you for considering my application; I look forward to the possibility of contributing to La Voce di New York’s impactful work.
Sincerely, Benedetta Munafò"
"based on this, define major, middle, small and emergin powers as a foreign policy analysis expert: Major powers and the search for primacy
At the top of the international hierarchy are major powers, those states with sufficient military and economic capacity to act with some measure of independence in the international system. The United States, with its superior military force as well as the world’s largest economy, currently occupies an undisputed status as the only superpower . This puts it in a unique position, both in terms of its ability to influence the international system and its responsibilities to maintain systemic stability. Bilateral
and multilateral avenues for foreign policy are readily available to major powers, especially as their ability to craft rules and institutions means they tend to dominate diplomatic processes and international organisations. The attractive pull of ‘soft power’ is also a factor in sustaining a major power’s status as ‘first among equals’ in the international system.
The study of the rise and fall of major powers inspired scholars like Charles Kindleberger (1978) to introduce the concept of ‘hegemony’
as a way of capturing the unique standing of these states. Hegemonic states are those that have been able to use their superior attributes – be they material, technological or in the realm of social organisation – to attain a position of dominance relative to other states in the international system. According to Joseph Nye and Robert Keohane (1977), hegemonic states pursue foreign policies that are concerned with the construction and maintenance of an international system such that it continues to serve their national interests (‘hegemonic stability’). This includes the
use of financial means to ensure that the national currency becomes the international pillar of the world economic system (as was the case with the British pound during the 19th century and the American dollar in the 20th century). Another example is the promotion of rule-making international institutions which uphold the basic interests and values of the hegemon, for example the American support for liberal trade through its promotion of the Bretton Woods institutions – the World Bank (WB), the IMF and now the World Trade Organisation.
Earlier periods in world history have been characterised not by a unipolar system dominated by a single hegemonic power as is the situation today, but by bipolar (the Cold War) and multipolar (19th-century Europe) systems in which rival states compete for standing in the world. Major states, or would-be hegemons, utilise coalition-building strategies to enhance their position and further their interests in pursuit of primacy. Under these circumstances, balance of power politics drives the foreign policy choices and actions of major states (see Chapter 3).
Though blessed with superior resources and means, major states do not operate without constraints. Indeed, in many respects, the expectation of leaders and their populations as to the ability of major states to secure their interests without serious cost can lead to foreign policy mishaps.
The failure of the United States to halt the communist takeover of China in 1949 and, two decades later, to drive out the communist forces in Vietnam – despite America’s overwhelming superiority in all categories of power – inspired serious domestic political crises. Coalitions of states opposed to the hegemon then arise that exploit foreign policy crises and challenge the prevailing international order. International law, the underlying principle of which is the sovereign equality of states, systematically attempts to
rein in the unilateralist instincts of major states which are not deemed acceptable to the international community. Even international institutions, though created originally by major powers to further their interests in the international system, are said by scholars of ‘principle-agent theory’ to develop some measure of autonomy from their progenitors.
7.3 Middle powers and multilateralism
Middle powers, that are clearly smaller than the major powers but with greater capability than small states, occupy a critical place within the international system. Though the scholarly debate over which criteria
are most appropriate to measure ‘middle-power-dom’ (with different readings of the importance of material attributes producing very different assessments), a sensible approach is to follow Andrew Cooper, Richard Higgot and Kim Nossal (as cited in Alden and Aran (2017)), who focus on the foreign policy conduct of these states. From their perspective, only states with the means and the desire to act as middle powers warrant inclusion in this category. Middle powers’ foreign policy manifests itself in three ways: as a ‘catalyst’ to promote global issues, as a ‘facilitator’ to build coalitions and as a ‘manager’ acting within their region to promote and/or enforce norms and institutional rules. Because of constraints on their resources, middle powers pursue ‘niche diplomacy’, that is, selective involvement in specific-issue areas that reflect their broader national interests. Their foreign policy is invariably multilateralist (some cynics would say by necessity rather than choice) and they see themselves as ‘bridge builders’ between opposing factions within the international community (for example, the former Soviet Union and the United States, or the industrialised north and impoverished south).
Canada and Australia are often upheld as classic examples of middle powers. Their foreign policies are oriented towards supporting multilateral institutions to find solutions to international problems and they expend considerable financial and political capital in pursuit of this aim. The
same could be said of Norway, which has leveraged its oil resources to pursue a targeted foreign policy that supports mediation of selective global problems, from the Oslo Accords in the Middle East to the negotiations in Sri Lanka.
As noted above, there are a number of difficulties with the existing definitions of middle powers. For instance, the self-ascribed status as ‘international good citizens’ and ‘bridge builders’, from the perspective
of critics, disguises the fundamentally supportive role that middle
powers have in upholding the established international system. Their prominent representation in international institutions like the UN or the IMF reflects their willingness to use multilateralism to ensure that the prevailing international order is maintained. Another problem occurs with situating emerging regional powers like Brazil and India, which were once characterised as middle powers but whose economic and military status already exceed that of the likes of Canada and Australia. Behaviour-based assessments of the foreign policy of these states, when coupled to Barry Buzan and Ole Weaver’s work on regional security complexes (as cited in Alden and Aran (2017)), suggest that the best way to understand them is as aspirant regional hegemons.
7.4 Small states and the search for security
Though this is an analytically unsatisfactory way to characterise them, small and weak states constitute ‘everyone else’; that is, recognised sovereign states that are not major or middle powers. Small states are distinguished primarily by their physical size, small population and
the accompanying constraints that these have on their participation in international affairs at a global level. Their foreign policy orientation is tailored to the region within which they are based and where their voice may have greater effect. A further category of small state is the ‘micro state’ – principally island nations in the Pacific like Fiji, and remnants of European feudalism, like San Marino. Weak states are not necessarily small; indeed, they could be large territorially or in terms of population but are unable to exercise effective authority over either of these,
usually due to internal conflict related to challenges of legitimacy or administrative ineptitude. For example, the Sudan and the Congo are both greater in size than Western Europe and have substantial populations. However, due to their history of conflict, exploitation and poor governance, they are weak states with little to no impact in international affairs (beyond the problems they pose as conflict zones).
In terms of the foreign policy of small and weak states, the constraints on choice – based on their limited means – inevitably obliges these states to seek out alliance partners and coalitions of other states. Multilateralism forms a crucial part of their foreign policy orientation, as international institutions provide both opportunities for coalition building and a platform for articulating and projecting their interests in ways that they might otherwise not be able to do.
Like middle powers, categorising just what constitutes a ‘small or weak state’ is problematic and has a bearing on one’s understanding of the range of possibilities and constraints on small and weak states. To begin with, smallness does not denote the level of power, and it would be a mistake to conflate size with lack of capacity or influence in the international system. For instance, Singapore in geographic and population terms is a minor state, and yet it has been able to play an important role both within its region and, albeit selectively, in international affairs. Equally, weakness is
a condition that is dependent upon the measures of power one chooses
to use and presumably can change, rendering the utility of this category subject to constant review. Ecuador, a small middle-income country with
a limited capacity to act outside of its neighbourhood, has a history of
debt dependency to Western dominated international financial institutions and, more recently, to China to fund its development plans. Does such
 52 dependency produce foreign policy effects? Another case is that of China which, until the 1990s, was seen to be a militarily significant power within its region with a strong centralised administration, but one that hosted an economy that was smaller than Switzerland’s. Should it have been called
a weak state? The limitations of these efforts at categorisation are, in this case, self-evident.
7.5 Emerging powers
‘Emerging powers’ is a label coined to describe a new group of states that have through a combination of economic prowess, diplomatic acumen and military might managed to move away from developing country status to challenge the dominance of mainly Western powers. Their ability to operate and profit from the neo-liberal trading system, using their relatively low-cost factor advantages to gain market share in both the industrial economies and developing world, has proved to be a successful formula for achieving nationalist development aims while providing substantial improvements in the economic livelihood of their citizens.
Emerging powers have increasingly sought to translate their economic standing into foreign policy gains on the global stage, a process that has been accelerated by the global financial crisis of 2008. For instance, they have brought pressure to bear on international institutions, in particular the IMF and the WB, to broaden the IMF and WB’s representivity to include a larger stake for emerging powers. For India and Brazil, getting a permanent seat on the UN Security Council is also a key priority. The suggestion that power transitions from one hegemonic order to a new one have historically been accompanied by conflict has caused countries like China to launch a diplomatic campaign designed to assure traditional powers that its drive for primacy would be a peaceful one.
One of the most interesting aspects of the foreign policy conduct and impact of emerging powers is their role in regions such as Africa which, at least until recently, had been overwhelmingly dominated by Europe and the United States. China, India and Brazil have at various times openly declared their economic interests in gaining access to African resources and (to a lesser degree) markets; all have used a combination of public and private sector means to achieve these aims. At the same time, as developing countries themselves, all three have felt compelled to use at least the rhetoric of South solidarity – and arguably its substance – in justifying their accelerating economic presence in Africa. And finally, though these emerging powers have provided long-standing (if relatively small) development assistance to Africa over the years, they have so
far shunned some key features of OECD official overseas development practices in applying what they prefer to characterise as forms of South– South cooperation."

"as a international political theory expert, explain this in detail. do it in a discoursive way following the authors train, also it has to be extremely detailed:  By the eighteenth century, slavery had become the root metaphor of Western political philosophy, connoting everything that was evil about power relations.' Freedom, its conceptual antithesis, was considered by Enlightenment thinkers as the highest and universal political value. Yet this political metaphor began to take root at precisely the time that the economic practice of slavery-the systematic, highly sophisticated capi- talist enslavement of non-Europeans as a labor force in the colonies-was increasing quantitatively and intensifying qualitatively to the point that by the mid-eighteenth century it came to underwrite the entire economic systemoftheWest,paradoxicallyfacilitatingtheglobalspreadofthevery Enlightenment ideals that were in such fundamental contradiction to it.
This glaring discrepancy between thought and practice marked the periodofthetransformationofglobalcapitalismfromitsmercantileto its protoindustrial form. One would think that, surely, no rational, ""en- lightened"" thinker could have failed to notice. But such was not the case.  
The exploitation of millions of colonial slave laborers was accepted as part of the given world by the very thinkers who proclaimed freedom to be man's natural state and inalienable right. Even when theoretical claims of freedom were transformed into revolutionary action on the political stage, it was possible for the slave-driven colonial economy that func- tioned behind the scenes to be kept in darkness.
If this paradox did not seem to trouble the logical consciousness of
contemporaries, it is perhaps more surprising that present-day writers,
while fully cognizant of the facts, are still capable of constructing Western histories as coherent narratives of human freedom. The reasons do not
need to be intentional. When national histories are conceived as self-
contained, or when the separate aspects of history are treated in disciplin- ary isolation, counterevidence is pushed to the margins as irrelevant. The greater the specialization of knowledge, the more advanced the level of research, the longer and more venerable the scholarly tradition, the eas- ier it is to ignore discordant facts. It should be noted that specialization and isolation are also a danger for those new disciplines such as African American studies, or new fields such as diaspora studies, that were estab- lished precisely to remedy the situation. Disciplinary boundaries allow counterevidence to belong to someone else's story. After all, a scholar can- not be an expert in everything. Reasonable enough. But such arguments are a way of avoiding the awkward truth that if certain constellations of facts are able to enter scholarly consciousness deeply enough, they threaten not only the venerable narratives, but also the entrenched aca- demic disciplines that (re)produce them. For example, there is no place in the university in which the particular research constellation ""Hegel and Haiti"" would have a home. That is the topic which concerns me here, and I am going to take a circuitous route to reach it. My apologies, but this apparent detour is the argument itself. The paradox between the discourse of freedom and the practice of slavery marked the ascendancy of a succession of Western nations withinof a Dutch husband and wife alone in a landscape, is included). Nor are there any other images of blacks.1' Of course, given the absence of slaves from Schama's written account, they would have been out of place in the illustrations. The consequence of this scholarship is partial blindness among seas of perspicacity, and it is characteristic of Western academic scholarship, as we shall see.

Beginning in 1651, Britain challenged the Dutch in a series of naval wars that led ultimately to British dominance not only of Europe but of the global economy, including the slave trade."" At the time, the Crom- wellian revolution against absolute monarchy and feudal privilege fol- lowed Dutch precedent by making metaphorical use of the Old Testament story of the Israelites being freed from slavery. But within political theory
a shedding of ancient scriptures was taking place. The pivotal figure here is Thomas Hobbes. Although Leviathan (1651) is a hybrid of modern and biblical imagery, slavery is discussed in clearly secular terms.'2 He sees it as a consequence of the war of all against all in the state of nature, hence belonging to the natural disposition of man.'3 Involved through his pa- tron, Lord Cavendish, with the affairs of the Virginia Company that gov- erned a colony in America, Hobbes accepted slavery as ""an inevitable part of the logic of power"" (PSAR, p. 263). Even the inhabitants of"" 'civil and flourishing nations' "" could revert again to this state.'4 Hobbes was honest and unconflicted about slavery-John Locke less so. The opening sen- tence of book 1, chapter 1, of his Two Treatises of Government (1690) states unequivocally:
Slavery is so vile and miserable an Estate of Man, and so directly opposite to the generous Temper and Courage of our Nation; that 'tis hardly to be conceived that an Englishman, much less a Gentleman, should plead for't.
But Locke's outrage against the ""Chains for all Mankind"" was not a pro- test against the enslavement of black Africans on New World plantations, least of all in colonies that were British.'5 Rather, slavery was a metaphor for legal tyranny, as it was used generally in British parliamentary debates on constitutional theory. A shareholder in the Royal African Company involved in American colonial policy in Carolina, Locke ""clearly regarded Negro slavery a justifiable institution"" (PSWC, p. 118).16 The isolation of the political discourse of social contract from the economy of household production (the oikos) made this double vision possible.'7 British liberty meant the protection of private property, and slaves were private prop- erty. So long as slaves fell under the jurisdiction of the household, their status was protected by law (figs. 2 and 3).18

A half-century later, the classical understanding of the economy- and hence slave owning-as a private, household concern was blatantly contradicted by new global realities. Sugar transformed the West Indian colonial plantations. Both capital and labor intensive, sugar production was protoindustrial, causing a precipitous rise in the importation of Afri- can slaves and a brutal intensification of their labor exploitation in order to meet a new and seemingly insatiable European demand for the ad- dictive sweetness of sugar.19 Leading the Caribbean-wide sugar boom was the French colony of Saint-Domingue that in 1767 produced 63,000 tons of sugar."" Sugar production led to a seemingly infinite demand for slaves as well, whose number in Saint-Domingue increased tenfold over the eighteenth century to over five hundred thousand human beings. Within France, more than 20 percent of the bourgeoisie was dependent upon slave-connected commercial activity.23 The French Enlightenment think-
ers wrote in the midst of this transformation. While they idealized indige-
nous colonial populations with myths of the noble savage (the ""Indians""
of the ""New World""), the economic lifeblood of slave labor was not their
concern.24 Although abolitionist movements did exist at this time, and in
France the Amis des Noirs (Friends of the Blacks) decried the excesses of
slavery, a defense of liberty on the grounds of racial equality was rare indeed.25 ""Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains."" So writes Jean- Jacques Rousseau in the opening lines of On the Social Contract, first pub- lished in 1762.26 No human condition appears more offensive to his heart or to his reason than slavery. And yet even Rousseau, patron saint of the French Revolution, represses from consciousness the millions of really ex- isting, European-owned slaves, as he relentlessly condemns the institution. Rousseau's egregious omission has been scrupulously exposed by scholar- ship, but only recently. The Catalonian-born philosopher Louis Sala-
Molins has written a history (1987) of Enlightenment thought through the lens of Le Code Noir, the French legal code that applied to black slaves in the colonies, drawn up in 1685 and signed by Louis XIV and not defini- tively eradicated until 1848. Sala-Molins proceeds point by point through the code, which legalized not only slavery, the treatment of human beings as moveable property, but the branding, torture, physical mutilation, and killing of slaves for attempting to defy their inhuman status. He juxta- poses this code, which applied to all slaves under French jurisdiction, to the Enlightenment philosophers' texts, documenting their indignation regarding slavery in theory while ""superbly"" ignoring slavery in practice. Sala-Molins is outraged and rightly so. In the Social Contract, Rousseau argues: ""The right of slavery is null, not simply because it is illegitimate, but because it is absurd and meaningless. These words, slavery and right [droit, that is, law], are contradictory. They are mutually exclusive.""27 Sala- Molins makes us see the consequences of this statement: ""The Code Noir, the most perfect example of this kind of convention in the time of Rous- seau, is not a legal code. The right of which it speaks is not a right, as it claims to make legal that which cannot be legalized, slavery"" (CN, p. 238). He thus finds it preposterous that Rousseau never in his writings men- tions the Code Noir. ""The one existing, flagrant case of what he is declaring categorically untenable gets none of his attention"" (CN, p. 241).28 Sala- Molins scrutinizes the texts for any evidence that might excuse this silence and finds, unequivocally, that Rousseau knew the facts. The Enlighten 
ment philosopher cited travel literature of the time-Kolben on the Hot-
tentots, du Tertre on Indians in the Antilles-but avoided those pages of
these same accounts that describe the horrors of European slavery explic-
itly. Rousseau referred to human beings everywhere-but omitted Afri-
cans; spoke of Greenland's people transported to Denmark who die of
sadness-but not of the sadness of Africans transported to the Indies that
resulted in suicides, mutinies, and maroonings. He declared all men
equal and saw private property as the source of inequality, but he never
put two and two together to discuss French slavery for economic profit as
central to arguments of both equality and property (see CN, pp. 243-46).
As in the Dutch Republic and Britain, African slaves were present, used
and abused domestically within France.29 Indeed, Rousseau could not not have known ""that there are boudoirs in Paris where one amuses oneself
indiscriminately with a monkey and a young black boy (nigrillon)"" (CN, p. 248).
Sala-Molins pronounces Rousseau's silence in the face of this evi- dence ""racist"" and ""revolting"" (CN, p. 253).3o Such outrage is unusual among scholars who, as professionals, are trained to avoid passionate
judgements in their writing. This moral neutrality is built into the disci- plinary methods that, while based on a variety of philosophical premises, result in the same exclusions. Today's intellectual historian who treats Rousseau in context will follow good professional form by relativizing the situation, judging (and excusing) Rousseau's racism by the mores of his time, in order to avoid thereby the fallacy of anachronism. Or, today's philosopher, who is trained to analyze theory totally abstracted from his- torical context, will attribute a universality to Rousseau's writings that transcends the author's own intent or personal limitations in order to avoid thereby the fallacy of reduction ad hominem. In both cases, the em- barrassing facts are quietly allowed to disappear. They are visible, how- ever, in general histories of the era, where they cannot help but be mentioned because when Enlightenment theory was put into practice, the perpetrators of political revolutions stumbled over the economic fact of slavery in ways that made their own acknowledgement of the contra- diction impossible to avoid. 
The colonial revolutionaries of America fighting for their indepen-
dence against Britain mobilized Locke's political discourse to their ends.
The metaphor of slavery was central to that struggle but in a new sense:
""Americans genuinely believed that men who were taxed without their
consent were literally slaves, since they had lost the power to resist oppres-
sion, and since defenselessness inevitably led to tyranny"" (PSAR, p.
273).31 In evoking the liberties of natural rights theory, the American col-
onists as slave owners were led to ""a monstrous inconsistency.""32 And, yet,
although some, like Benjamin Rush, acknowledged their bad faith,3 and
some, like Thomas Jefferson, blamed black slavery on the British;34 al-
though the slaves themselves petitioned for their liberty,35 and a few indi-
vidual states passed antislavery legislation,36 the new nation, conceived in
liberty, tolerated the ""monstrous inconsistency,"" writing slavery into the United States Constitution.
The French encyclopedist, Denis Diderot, spoke admiringly of the U.S. revolutionaries as having ""'burned their chains' "" and ""'refused slav- ery' "" (SP, p. 85).17 But if the colonial nature of the United States struggle for freedom made it somehow possible to sustain the distinction between the political discourse and social institutions, in the case of the French Revolution a decade later the various meanings of slavery became hope- lessly entangled when they came up against fundamental contradictions between revolutionary developments within France and developments
in the French colonies without. It took years of bloodshed before slav- ery-really-existing slavery, not merely its metaphorical analogy-was abolished in the French colonies, and even then the gains were only tem- porary. Although abolition of slavery was the only possible logical out- come of the ideal of universal freedom, it did not come about through the revolutionary ideas or even the revolutionary actions of the French; it came about through the actions of the slaves themselves. The epicenter of this struggle was the colony of Saint-Domingue. In 1791, while even the most ardent opponents of slavery within France dragged their feet, the half-million slaves in Saint-Domingue, the richest colony not only of France but of the entire colonial world, took the struggle for liberty into their own hands, not through petitions, but through violent, organized revolt.38 In 1794 the armed blacks of Saint-Domingue forced the French Republic to acknowledge the fait accompli of the abolition of slavery on that island (declared by the French colonial commissioners, Sonthonax and Polverel, acting on their own) and to universalize abolition through- 
out the French colonies.""9 From 1794 to 1800, as freemen, these former slaves engaged in a struggle against invading British forces, who many of the white and mulatto land-owning colonists of Saint-Domingue hoped would reestablish slavery.40 The black army under the leadership of Toussaint-Louverture defeated the British militarily in a struggle that strengthened the Abolitionist movement within Britain, setting the stage for the British suspension of the slave trade in 1807.41 In 1801, Toussaint- Louverture, the former slave and now governor of Saint-Domingue, sus- pected that the French Directory might attempt to rescind abolition.42 And yet, still loyal to the Republic,43 he wrote a constitution for the colony that was in advance of any such document in the world-if not in its premises of democracy, then surely in regard to the racial inclusiveness of its definition of the citizenry.44 In 1802, Napoleon did move to reestablish slavery and the Code Noir and had Toussaint arrested and deported to France, where he died in prison in 1803. When Napoleon sent French troops under Leclerc to subdue the colony, waging a brutal struggle against the black population ""that amounted to a war of genocide,""45 the black citizens of Saint-Domingue once again took up arms, demon- strating, in Leclerc's own words: ""'It is not enough to have taken away Toussaint, there are 2,000 leaders to be taken away' "" (BJ, p. 346). On 1
January 1804, the new military leader, slave-born Jean-Jacques Dessa- lines, took the final step of declaring independence from France, thus combining the end of slavery with the end of colonial status. Under the banner of Liberty or Death (these words were inscribed on the red and blue flag, from which the white band of the French had been re- moved [see BJ, p. 365]),46 he defeated the French troops and destroyed the white population, establishing in 1805 an independent, constitutional nation of ""black"" citizens, an ""empire,"" mirroring Napoleon's own, which he called by the Arawak name, Haiti.47 These events, leading to the com- plete freedom of the slaves and the colony, were unprecedented. ""Never before had a slave society successfully overthrown its ruling class"" (""HA,"" p. 114).
The self-liberation of the African slaves of Saint-Domingue gained for them, by force, the recognition of European and American whites- if only in the form of fear. Among those with egalitarian sympathies, it gained them respect as well. For almost a decade, before the violent elimi- nation of whites signalled their deliberate retreat from universalist prin- ciples, the black Jacobins of Saint-Domingue surpassed the metropole in actively realizing the Enlightenment goal of human liberty, seeming to give proof that the French Revolution was not simply a European phe- 
nomenon but world-historical in its implications.48 If we have become ac- customed to different narratives, ones that place colonial events on the margins of European history, we have been seriously misled. Events in Saint-Domingue were central to contemporary attempts to make sense out of the reality of the French Revolution and its aftermath.49 We need to be aware of the facts from this perspective.

terms of the evolution in consciousness of Europeans living through it.
The French revolutionaries understood themselves from the start as a
liberation movement that would free people from the ""slavery"" of feud inequities. In 1789 the slogans Live Freely or Die and Rather Death Tha Slavery were common, and the ""Marseillaise"" denounced ""l'esclavage an tique"" in this context (see OCS, p. 230). This was a revolution against, no merely the tyranny of a particular ruler, but of all past traditions tha violated the general principles of human liberty. Reporting on the event in Paris in summer 1789, the German publicist Johann Wilhelm vo Archenholz (from whom we will hear again) lost his customary journali tic neutrality and exclaimed that the French ""'people'"" (Volk), who ""'wer accustomed to kissing their chains ... had, in a matter of hours, broke these gigantic chains with one all-conquering stroke of courage, becom ing freer than the Romans and Greeks were, and the Americans and Bri ish are today.'""50
But what of the colonies, the source of wealth of such a large part o
the French population? The meaning of freedom was at stake in their reaction to the events of 1789 and nowhere more so than in the crown
jewel, Saint-Domingue. Would the colonists take after the Amer  Critical Inquiry Summer 2000 837
revolt, as some of the Creole planters of Saint-Domingue were urging?
Or would they join fraternally to proclaim their ""liberty"" as French citi-
zens? And if the latter, then who were to be included as citizens? Property
owners, to be sure.5' But only whites? Mulattoes owned an estimated one-
third of the cultivated land in Saint-Domingue.52 Ought not they to be
included, and not only they, but the free blacks as well? Was property or
was race the litmus test for being a citizen of France? Most pertinent, if
Africans could in principle be included as citizens-if, that is, the implic-
itly racist assumptions that underlay the Code Noir were not valid-then
how could the continued legal enslavement of blacks be justified?53 And if
it could not, how could the colonial system be maintained? The unfolding
of the logic of freedom in the colonies threatened to unravel the total insti-
tutional framework of the slave economy that supported such a substan-
tial part of the French bourgeoisie, whose political revolution, of course,
this was.54 And yet only the logic of freedom gave legitimacy to their revo- lution in the universal terms in which the French saw themselves.
The Haitian Revolution was the crucible, the trial by fire for the ide- als of the French Enlightenment. And every European who was part of the bourgeois reading public knew it.55 ""The eyes of the world are St. Domingo.""56 So begins an article published in 1804 in Minerva, thejour- nal founded by Archenholz, who had been covering the French Revolution since its beginnings and reporting on the revolution in Saint-Domingue since 1792.57 For a full year, from fall 1804 to the end of 1805, Minerva pub- lished a continuing series, totalling more than a hundred pages, including source documents, news summaries, and eyewitness accounts, that in- formed its readers not only of the final struggle for independence of this French colony-under the banner Liberty or Death!58-but of events over the previous ten years as well. Archenholz was critical of the violence of this revolution (as he was of the Jacobin Terror in the metropole), but he came to appreciate Toussaint-Louverture, publishing as part of his series, in German translation, a chapter from the new manuscript by a British captain, Marcus Rainsford, who praised Toussaint's character, leadership, and humanity in superlatives.59
Archenholz's journal borrowed freely from English and French sources so that his account reflected news widely reported to the Euro- pean reading public, and the articles in Minerva were picked up in turn by ""countless newspapers"" (a situation of cosmopolitan and open commu- nication, despite intellectual property restrictions, that has perhaps not been matched until the early internet) (JWA, p. 62). Although there was censorship in the French press after 1803,60 newspapers and journals in Britain (also the United States and Poland)61 highlighted the events of the final revolutionary struggle in Saint-Domingue--the Edinburgh Re- view, among others (see ""HA,"" pp. 113-15).62 William Wordsworth wrote a sonnet entitled ""To Toussaint Louverture,"" published in The Morning Post in February 1803, in which he deplored the reestablishment of the Code Noir in the French colonies (figs. 4 and 5).63
In the German-language press, Minerva's coverage was special. Al- ready in 1794, two years after its founding, it had established its rep- utation as the best of its genre of political journals. It strove to be nonpartisan, objective, and factual, aiming at ""'historical truth'"" that would be ""'instructive ... [for] our grandchildren'"" (JWA, pp. 69-70).64 Its goal, according to the journal's (English!) motto, was ""to shew the very age and body of the time its form and pressure.""65 By 1798 its circula was three thousand copies (respectable in our day for an intellectually serious journal), and that number is estimated to have doubled by 1809. In the words of Archenholz's biographer, Minerva was ""the most impor- tant political journal of the turn of the century"" both in terms of quality of content, written by regular correspondents (who were important public figures in their own right), and the quality of readers, among whom were some of the most influential people in Germany (JWA, p. 131).66 King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia ""read Minerva constantly"" (JWA, p. 130). Both Goethe and Schiller read Minerva (the latter corresponded with Archenholz),67 as well as Klopstock (who contributed to the journal), Schelling, and Lafayette. And-need I keep it from you any longer?- another regular reader of Minerva, as we know from his published letters, was the philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.68

""Where did Hegel's idea of the relation between lordship and bond- age originate?"" ask the Hegel experts, repeatedly, referring to the famous metaphor of the ""struggle to death"" between the master and slave, which for Hegel provided the key to the unfolding of freedom in world history and which he first elaborated in The Phenomenology of Mind, written in Jena in 1805-6 (the first year of the Haitian nation's existence) and published in 1807 (the year of the British abolition of the slave trade). Where, indeed? The intellectual historians of German philosophy know only one place to look for the answer: the writings of other intellectuals. Perhaps it was Fichte, writes George Armstrong Kelly, although ""the problem of lordship and bondage is essentially Platonic.""69 Judith Shklar takes the common route of connecting Hegel's discussion to Aristotle. Otto Pbggeler-and there is no finer name in German Hegel scholar- ship-says that the metaphor does not come from even the ancients, but is a totally ""abstract"" example.70 Only one scholar, Pierre-Franklin Ta- vares, has ever actually made the connection of Hegel and Haiti, basing his argument on evidence that Hegel read the French abolitionist, the Abb6 Gr6goire.71 (His work, written in the early 1990s, has as far as I can tell been resoundingly ignored by the Hegel establishment.) But even Tavares deals with the later Hegel, after the master-slave dialectic had been conceived.72 No one has dared to suggest that the idea for the dia- lectic of lordship and bondage came to Hegel in Jena in the years 1803-5 from reading the press-journals and newspapers. And yet this selfsame Hegel, in this very Jena period during which the master-slave dialectic was first conceived, made the following notation:
Reading the newspaper in early morning is a kind of realistic morn- ing prayer. One orients one's attitude against the world and toward God [in one case], or toward that which the world is [in the other]. The former gives the same security as the latter, in that one knows where one stands.73
We are left with only two alternatives. Either Hegel was the blind- est of all the blind philosophers of freedom in Enlightenment Europe, surpassing Locke and Rousseau by far in his ability to block out reality right in front of his nose (the print right in front of his nose at the break- fast table); or Hegel knew-knew about real slaves revolting successful- ly against real masters, and he elaborated his dialectic of lordship and bondage deliberately within this contemporary context.74 Michel-Rolph Trouillot writes in his important book Silencing the Past that the Haitian Revolution ""entered history with the peculiar character- istic of being unthinkable even as it happened."" Of course he is correct to emphasize the incapacity of most contemporaries, given their ready-made
categories, ""to understand the ongoing revolution on its own terms"" (SP, p. 73). But there is a danger in conflating two silences, the past and the
present one, when it comes to the Haitian story. For if men and women in the eighteenth century did not think in nonracial terms of the ""funda- mental equality of humanity,"" as ""some of us do today,"" at least they knew what was happening; today, when the Haitian slave revolution might be more thinkable, it is more invisible, due to the construction of disciplinary discourses through which knowledge of the past has been inherited (SP, p. 82).75
Eighteenth-century Europeans were thinking about the Haitian Rev- olution precisely because it challenged the racism of many of their pre- conceptions. One did not have to have been a supporter of the slave revolution to recognize its central significance to the political discourse.76 ""Even in the age of revolutions, contemporaries recognized the creation of Haiti as something extraordinary"" (""HA,"" p. 113). And even its oppo- nents considered this ""remarkable event"" to be ""worthy of the contempla- tion of philosophers.""77 Marcus Rainsford wrote in 1805 that the cause of the Haitian Revolution was the ""spirit of liberty.""78 The fact that this spirit could be catching, crossing the line not only between races but between slaves and freemen, was precisely what made it possible to argue, without reverting to an abstract ontology of ""nature,"" that the desire for freedom was truly universal, an event of world history and, indeed, the paradigm-
breaking example. Prior to writing The Phenomenology of Mind, Hegel had
dealt with the theme of mutual recognition in terms of Sittlichkeit: crimi-
nals against society or the mutual relations of religious community or
personal affection. But now this young lecturer, still only in his early thir-
ties, made the audacious move to reject these earlier versions (more ac-
ceptable to the established philosophical discourse) and to inaugurate, as
the central metaphor of his work, not slavery versus some mythical state
of nature (as those from Hobbes to Rousseau had done earlier), but slaves
versus masters, thus bringing into his text the present, historical realities that surrounded it like invisible ink.
8
Let us consider, in more detail, Hegel's dialectic of lordship and bondage and concentrate on the salient characteristics of this relation- ship. (I will draw not only on the relevant passages in The Phenomenology of Mind but also the Jena texts that immediately preceded it, 1803-6.)79 Hegel understands the position of the master in both political and eco-
nomic terms. In the System der Sittlichkeit (1803): ""The master is in posses-
sion of an overabundance of physical necessities generally, and the other
[the slave] in the lack thereof.""""80 At first consideration the master's situa-
tion is ""independent, and its essential nature is to be for itself""; whereas
""the other,"" the slave's position, ""is dependent, and its essence is life or
existence for another.""81 The slave is characterized by the lack of recogni-
tion he receives. He is viewed as ""a thing""; ""thinghood"" is the essence of
slave consciousness-as it was the essence of his legal status under the
Code Noir (PM, p. 235). But as the dialectic develops, the apparent domi- nance of the master reverses itself with his awareness that he is in fact
totally dependent on the slave. One has only to collectivize the figure of the master in order to see the descriptive pertinence of Hegel's analysis: the slave-holding class is indeed totally dependent on the institution of slavery for the ""overabundance"" that constitutes its wealth. This class is thus incapable of being the agent of historical progress without annihila ing its own existence.82 But then the slaves (again, collectivizing the fig- ure) achieve self-consciousness by demonstrating that they are not things, not objects, but subjects who transform material nature.""8 Hegel's text becomes obscure and falls silent at this point of realization.84 But given the historical events that provided the context for The Phenomenology of Mind, the inference is clear. Those who once acquiesced to slavery dem- onstrate their humanity when they are willing to risk death rather than remain subjugated.85 The law (the Code Noir!) that acknowledges them merely as ""a thing"" can no longer be considered binding,86 although be- 
fore, according to Hegel, it was the slave himself who was responsible for his lack of freedom by initially choosing life over liberty, mere self- preservation.""' In The Phenomenology of Mind, Hegel insists that freedom cannot be granted to slaves from above. The self-liberation of the slave is required through a ""trial by death"": ""And it is solely by risking life that freedom is obtained.... The individual, who has not staked his life, may, no doubt, be recognized as a Person [the agenda of the abolitionists!]; but he has not attained the truth of this recognition as an independent self- consciousness"" (PM, p. 233). The goal of this liberation, out of slavery, cannot be subjugation of the master in turn, which would be merely to repeat the master's ""existential impasse,""88 but, rather, elimination of the institution of slavery altogether.
Given the facility with which this dialectic of lordship and bondage
lends itself to such a reading, one wonders why the topic Hegel and Haiti
has for so long been ignored. Not only have Hegel scholars failed to an-
swer this question; they have failed, for the past two hundred years, even to ask it.89 
Surely a major reason for this omission is the Marxist appropriation
of a social interpretation of Hegel's dialectic. Since the 1840s, with the
early writings of Karl Marx, the struggl"
"as a foreign policy analysis expert, explain this in detail. do it in a discoursive way following the authors train, also it has to be extremely detailed: 'In international relations, what we call' Geography 'is subjected to two contradictory appraisals. The influence of factors considered to be geographic is either greatly exaggerated or nearly overlooked, in spite of obvious territorial imperatives.' Lacoste (1984, 213).
The ending of the Cold War has been much heralded. The seemingly stable terrain of bloc politics underwritten by the master code of totalitarianism/anti-communism has been upended by revolutions in Eastern Europe and the collapse of the Soviet
Union (Pietz 1988; Luke 1991). The effects for the western 'security intellectual' appear highly disruptive. Forty years of advocating strategies of containment and nuclear deterrence provide few pointers in the 1990s for analysing or dealing with the uncertainties of any post-Cold War world (Taylor 1992).
If the Gulf War of 1990-1 revealed anything, however, about the Western Alliance and how the war was discursively fought, it was how the Cold War codes/reasoning of containment were simply redirected against a general malevolence instead of simply communism. These codes are inherently geographical, for to be effective one must know which places and peoples are to be considered ' evil ' and as a consequence which are to be labelled as' good '. In the case of the Cold War, these simple characterisations constituted a powerful 'war of words' where the capitalist/freedom-loving West was pitted against the communist/totalitarian East (Kaldor 1990).
This short paper is organised in three parts. The first section briefly explores the recent literature of critical geopolitics. It is suggested that the new forms of geopolitics currently on offer have much to offer foreign policy analysis. The question of expertise
is addressed in the second section. Those who comment on foreign policy and inter national affairs occupy a privileged position in society. One only had to watch the television during the Gulf War to witness the sway given to the commentaries of those
armchair strategists. The third section addresses the issue of how places are scripted in foreign policy. In spite of the risk of being accused of stating the obvious, political
geographers have a useful role to play in investigating how geographical represen tations within foreign policy emerge and in the process highlight where author(ity) lies. My conclusions attempt to set out briefly what critical geopolitics can offer to foreign
policy analysis.
Critical geopolitics: new research directions
The recent literature on critical geopolitics has amongst other things sought to explore
the role of security intellectuals and foreign policy experts in the making of foreign policy (O'Tuathail and Agnew 1992; Agnew and Corbridge 1989; Dalby 1990). By redefining geopolitics as a discursive practice various writers had hoped to create a new focus on the reasoning process by which security intellectuals' spatialise 'international politics. Two types of geopolitics have been identified: first, the formal texts of the academic experts such as Colin Gray who are in turn supported by an array of research institutions. Secondly, a practical or common sense type of reasoning has been identified with a focus on how foreign places are represented in foreign policy discourse.
The distinction between formal and practical geopolitical reasoning is not entirely a product of the recent Anglo-American critical geopolitical literature. The French geopolitical writer Yves Lacoste has identified similar types of reasoning. In 1984, for example, he noted in an article on geography and foreign policy that '. . . I am going
to show how and why the method of true geographic reasoning-reasoning of the strategic type (which is very different from that employed in the academic world) is particularly effective in analysing international relations and the foreign policies of states ' (1984, 216).
Both Anglo-American critical geopolitics and French geopolitics have sought to challenge orthodox geopolitics. One of the most useful traits of these different
literatures is their focus on the geographical aspects of contemporary foreign policy making. First, following O'Tuathail and Agnew (1992), I suggest that the practice of foreign policy is inherently geopolitical because it involves the construction of meaning and values of spaces and places. Instead of focusing on how, for example, the external
environment influences foreign policy, critical geopolitics seeks to examine how geographical representations are constructed and how those representations in turn structure the perceived reality of places. Thus, geography, instead of being treated as a
mere stage or backdrop on which events occur, is seen as a crucial element in the construction of ' worlds '.
It may seem self-evident that foreign policy has geographical connotations. How ever, by drawing attention to the fact that there is no ' natural' or ' prediscursive ' geography of international relations, we draw attention to how policy makers and academic experts through linguistic practices represent places and peoples in the practice of foreign policy. Foreign policy if viewed as a boundary-producing practice, draws attention to how the boundaries that divide relations between the domestic and the foreign are constituted (Campbell 1990). In the process spaces are clearly demarcated.
Privileging expertise
When we discuss something as important as the foreign policy of a state, we clearly need to draw attention to the narrative functions of a state's privileged story tellers. In this case, we need to consider the role of academic experts, the media and foreign policy professionals themselves (eg Foreign Office officials). This seems to be a relatively
understudied aspect of political geography, foreign policy analysis and inter national relations. Few seem to stop and consider the power relations embedded in
their claims to expertise. As Edward Said (1983, 2) has usefully noted, 'Expertise in foreign affairs, for example, has usually meant the legitimation of the conduct of foreign
policy and, what is more to the point, a sustained investment in revalidating the role of experts in foreign policy' (see also Said 1981).
There exists a close relationship between the media, academic experts and foreign policy professionals. In many respects, the academic expert is closely involved with the other two. In the context of the media, we only need to look at television and the discussion of foreign affairs to note the role of the ' expert ' in explaining events to us in the form of a simple story. In the case of the 1982 Falklands War and the 1991 Gulf War, the role of the academic and military armchair strategists was striking (Newman 1988). The media coverage of the Gulf War, which included a mixture of Allied press briefings, pictures of Allied forces and commentary from the experts, produced a
remarkably sanitised and controlled televisual spectacle.
In the case of the foreign policy professionals, we know that academics interview
those professionals as part of their research. In addition, the Foreign Office will periodically invite academics to discuss matters of state. In return, the academic
institutions such as the Royal Institute for International Affairs or the International Institute for Strategic Studies regularly invite Foreign Offce personnel to workshops and conferences.
The role of the research institute in informing or influencing foreign policy-making is a much neglected topic. In Britain, the strategic or foreign policy expert plays an important role in cultivating and sustaining an elite audience. There is considerable interaction between the two groups as discussion papers are read and digested by foreign policy makers. In the Foreign Office, for example, each department has a
number of officials who produce commentaries on current academic research in their respective regions of interest. This collective group, as feminist writers such as
Christine Sylvester have noted, is overwhelmingly a white, middle class, university or military educated male elite.
The place of scripting in the narratives of foreign policy
The metaphor of script has been employed by O'Tuathail and Agnew (1992) to de scribe how place is embedded in the foreign policy narrative. Scripts have been defined as a set of representations, a collection of descriptions, attributes and scenarios deemed necessary to define a place. I think the notion of scripting is useful because it conjures up images of the script or film writer constantly re-writing or changing a story line or narrative. One of the most common everyday practices we use to make sense of the unfamiliar or the novel is to establish a narrative with sequentially ordered plot, a cast of characters, identifiable and attributable forces in order to make sense of the
unknown. I am not trying to trivialise the practice of foreign policy, instead I merely draw attention to how foreign policy scripts tell stories about the ' other/foreign ' in order to differentiate the ' domestic' from the ' other.'
Whilst I accept O'Tuathail and Agnew's definition as useful, I think that we should also note how the State uses foreign policy to construct stable identities for itself. Such practices seek to establish various dimensions of identity with territory so that it is possible to speak of a state with a stable and definable character. As a consequence of defining domestic identity, the production of difference becomes crucial if there is to be
meaningful differentiation of the self and other. Campbell (1990, 1992a, 1992b) has usefully drawn attention to the construction of these ethical boundaries and how they establish moral and political spaces, incorporate standards of legitimacy, privilege certain interpretations of history and marginalise alternatives.
Does it matter that the operation of foreign policy involves constructing represen tations of the ' domestic ' and the ' foreign '? Does it matter, for example, that the complexities of places and peoples are reduced to more manageable proportions? It is not inevitable that however geographically sensitive we hope a state's foreign policy
might be, places and regions will be lumped together? It may be necessary to generalise  about certain parts of the world, but what is absolutely critical is that the labels that are used by foreign policy professionals and academic experts are always contested.
The recent Gulf War provided ample evidence that the geographical representations of peoples and places have the utmost significance. By drawing on the memories and scripts of World War II, the Western Alliance was able to depict the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait, the subsequent Allied launch of Desert Storm and the short land war that followed in highly dichotomous terms (for accounts of the war, see Freedman and Karsh 1991; Halliday 1991; Luke 1991; MacArthur 1991; Simpson 1991 and
Woodward 1991). We were told that it was a simple fight between ' good ' and ' evil '. Saddam Hussein was cast as the villain, another ' Hitler-like ' figure who had demon strated the bankruptcy of his regime by invading a small nation (Kuwait) that was
rapidly transformed into a latter day Czechoslovakia or Poland-a country far away about which we know little. The narratives of World War II were used because it is the
last 'good and just war ' that exists unproblematically in the collective memories of American and British citizens. The memories of Vietnam and Suez could thus be
banished, although in Britain's case the memories of the Falklands have eased this task. Indeed the parallels between the discursive response of the Thatcher government to the 1982 War and the Gulf Crisis were alarmingly similar (Dillon 1989).
I do not wish to discuss the Gulf War any further except to note that the geographical depictions of Iraq made by the West were highly arbitrary and ultimately effective in the way they were able to contribute to a story of unprovoked aggression by Iraq and
the need to reverse that wrong-doing. In times of war it is perhaps easier to appreciate how the depiction of places and peoples within foreign policy is important. However,
in a more general sense, these depictions are continuously in operation as policy professionals attempt to simplify the world and its regions into more malleable
forms. As a consequence these descriptions tend to transform places into singular and predictable units. As O'Tuathail and Agnew (1992, 202) conclude, 'The irony of practical geographical representations of place is that, in order to succeed, they actually necessitate the abrogation of genuine geographical knowledge about the diversity and complexity of places as social entities. 'Although it remains to be explained what form
' genuine ' geographical knowledge might take and, importantly, if it is possible.
Conclusions
The making of foreign policy has profound geographical and geopolitical implications. Representations of places and peoples as' foreign 'are clearly crucial in the execution of foreign policy. Adopting the metaphor of a script or performance usefully draws attention to how the self and the other are made familiar. In constructing a policy for the 'other', a state is inevitably involved in the production of difference. How a state
draws discursive and political boundaries to establish an identity over ' sovereign' territory should draw our attention to the role of experts, foreign policy professionals and media people. These three groups are the state's privileged story tellers. It is they
who legitimate foreign policy, and it is they who promote their mutual expertise.
The contribution of critical geopolitics can be seen in two different ways. First, it
puts the notion of space back into the centre of international politics. By refusing to treat space as simply a backdrop or stage for international affairs we can draw attention to how the construction of space is crucial to sustaining the drama of international life. Secondly, critical geopolitics can draw attention to how places and peoples are scripted by foreign policy discourse. Instead of seeking to legitimate or encourage these
discourses, we can actually begin to challenge them."

"make some notes out of this paragraph: Reflecting upon the surge in European nationalism and the aggressive foreign policies that accompanied this phenomenon, 19th-century geographers developed a range of theories that linked the physical position and character of the nation-state to the formulation of national behaviour, and with that its foreign policy. Their musings gave rise to the classical geo-strategists and their theories of world domination, including works such as Halford Mackinder’s ‘heartland’ thesis (which famously declared that ‘he who controls the heartland – i.e. Eastern Europe – controls the world island’) and Alfred Mahan’s assessment of the centrality of sea power. Both of these works were influential in the military planning of
the major powers. From this perspective, topography and terrain were key determinants of foreign policy; for example, Britain as an island was destined to become a maritime power, while the American foreign policy of isolationism grew out of the physical fact of its being separated from continental Europe (and Asia) by two vast oceans.
Tied to a state’s geographic position as a source of influence over foreign policy is its resource endowment, which includes the degree of access it has to the vital needs of society (food, water, energy) and its dependency on trade to obtain these requirements. The national population is also a critical resource, with a large population viewed as a positive indication
of the strength of a state, both in terms of its economic productivity and
its ability to marshal an effective military. This was given foreign policy expression, rather infamously, in Nazi Germany’s rationale (‘Lebensraum’ or living room) for its expansion into Eastern Europe, while Mao promoted population growth as a panacea for China’s military and economic shortcomings after 1949. A further influence of the external environment upon a state’s foreign policy is its level of economic development and its capacity to use this to enhance its foreign policy instruments. In particular, a country’s balance of payments status, its trade dependency, the need
 56
for capital and the level of technical skills sourced from abroad are all critical factors. In this context, Imperial Japan’s drive into Manchuria
and Southeast Asia was as much a quest for vital economic resources needed to maintain its own development as a desire to dislodge European colonialism.
Foreign policy makers in the late 19th and most of the 20th centuries construed these maxims on nationalism, geographic position and self- sufficiency as guiding notions for foreign policy formulation. Moreover, the failure to account for these factors or to misread them clearly had serious penalties for major powers as well as smaller states. An example of this was John Kennedy’s declaration that his government would ‘pay any price and bear any burden’ in its containment of communism, a foreign policy posture built upon a sense of unlimited American resources. The financial burden of sustaining American intervention in the Vietnam War, coupled to its political ramifications at home, brought about a serious foreign policy crisis and accusations of ‘imperial overstretch’ (much like the impact of the Anglo-Boer war in Britain in an earlier century). China’s ‘Belt and Road Initiative’, a grand strategy launched to much fanfare in 2013 that mobilised over $1 trillion in foreign reserves to underwrite Chinese-led infrastructure projects across Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America, encountered numerous difficulties in implementation and, over time, in securing debt repayments. By 2019, faced with domestic economic problems of its own, Beijing had largely stopped all new lending (with
the dubious exception of refinancing existing debt obligations). Again, the perils of misreading the relationship between its own capacity and the material costs of a global expansion are evident."

"as an international political theory expert, explain this, I can't understand: Karl Heinrich Marx was born in 1818 in Trier, which was then part of the Karl Heinrich Marx was born in 1818 in Trier, which was then part of the Prussian Rhineland (it became part of the unified German empire in 1871), and died in London in 1881. He was forced to move in response to political persecution, first to Paris in 1843, then to Brussels and Cologne, before finally settling in London in 1849 after the 1848 Revolutions in mainland Europe. These political movements reflected the social dislocations brought about by the transformation of agriculture and the early development of industrial production. They also reflected the political upheavals of the breakdown of old absolutist regimes and the rise of new political institutions that embodied elements of popular sovereignty, especially after the French Revolution (Hobsbawm 1962, 1977).
In his discussion of the social and political significance of this disorder, Marx drew on the intellectual resources of German idealism in philosophy, on French radicalism and socialism in politics, and on British political economy (McLellan 1973). At least initially, however, his critical reflections on contemporary society derived from Hegel’s engagement with liberal thought and its implications for putatively modern social structures. Hegel’s mode of argument shaped Marx’s dialectical approach, even though it was the material conditions rather than ‘spirit’ that engaged Marx. Marx was deeply interested in how societies represented themselves to themselves through their philosophers, policymakers, and practical ‘men of the world’. He started by taking Hegel’s arguments on their own terms, in order to establish their limits and the need to develop a more radical criticism. That criticism had to engage with the task of changing the world in order to realise human freedom (or emancipation from unjust domination), as Marx (1975 [1845]) declared in his eleventh thesis on Feuerbach. By contrast, Hegel had understood the present to be an approximation of freedom as already realised in the world.
Up to a point there are also parallels to be drawn with Tocqueville, who was a near contemporary of Marx, though they did not directly engage with each other
(Edwards 2007).1 All three were concerned with the breakdown of the old feudal order and the delineation of the new society that would take its place. Hegel and Tocqueville were both concerned to reconcile aspects of the status hierarchies and social order of the old society with the commercial relations of the new. As we have seen, Tocqueville understood modernity, in ideal typical form, as headed in the direction of a ‘society of equals’ and its accompanying political institutions. Hegel, for his part, was much more committed to maintaining a hierarchical order of estates (i.e. status groups) – specifically, agricultural and commercial estates – and understanding their social and political expression under a revised liberal constitution.
Marx was scathing about both positions. The necessary condition for the truth of Hegel’s reconciliation was the stability and inclusivity of the order he was seeking to justify. In his ‘Critique of Hegel’s Doctrine of the State’, Marx (1975 [1843a]) regarded this condition as contradicted by the emergence of what might be called an ‘estate of no estate’ (Lubasz 1976) – that is, a growing population of poor people that fell outside the duties and obligations of the estate system, and therefore outside Hegel’s conceptual scheme. In the course of Marx’s development, this estate of no estate would be reinterpreted as a proletariat; in other words it would be represented not as a group outside society – and hence an external limit to Hegel’s theory – but as a group integral to the new society. The proletariat would be the real and contradictory foundation of this new society and, beyond it, the agent of another, transformed society.
Further, according to Marx, hierarchy was not going to be replaced by equality, as Tocqueville supposed, though this might happen in a future communist
society.2 As market exchange relations progressed, Tocqueville’s ‘society of equals’ would reveal itself to be a society of divided classes. Indeed, as Marx (1973 [1852]) put it in ‘The Eighteenth Brumaire’, emerging here was not only a political despotism of the kind seen in France, on Tocqueville’s admission, but a
social despotism of the bourgeoisie as a class over and above other classes.3 ‘The Eighteenth Brumaire’ was an essay about fragmentary social classes, and the moment in French politics that Marx described in it was the coup d’état by Napoleon’s nephew, Louis-Phillipe, that had followed the suppression of revolutionary uprisings in 1848.
The bourgeoisie, which according to Marx was in the ascendant in the new republic, had allied itself with ‘the financial aristocracy, the industrial bourgeoisie, the middle class, the petty bourgeoisie, the army, the Mobile Guard (i.e. the organised lumpenproletariat), the intellectual celebrities, the priests and
the rural population’.4 Marx argued that a defeated proletariat had not yet learned how to express its interests. Its demands, he thought, were ‘utopian “humbug”, which must be finished with’. Yet, even at this intensely focused moment, in Paris, colonialism was present. The insurrection was put down; ‘over 3,000 insurgents [were] butchered after the victory, and a further 15,000 ... transported without having been convicted’ (Marx 1973 [1852]: 154). But he does not mention that it was the French African army that was used to suppress the insurrection, by razzia methods developed in colonial Algeria (Sessions 2015). Further, the insurgents were transported to Algeria to be used as colonial
labour force (Delnore 2015).
Marx developed his critical approach, at least in the first instance, in the absence of a rigorous sociological account of class. Nevertheless, by the time of ‘The Eighteenth Brumaire’ we can see contours of such an account developing, namely those associated with the ideas of social learning through struggle and of the proletariat as the agent of future social change. This development of class analysis has consequences for the nature and kind of criticism that would follow, including the foreclosure of specific possibilities of understanding modernity differently. Put very simply, if we interpret the estate of no estate as consisting of all those dispossessed and impoverished through the development of modern commercial society, then the category would be populated much more variously than when it is understood as a nascent proletariat formed within the capital– labour relation. It would include all those dispossessed and coerced by colonialism (Robinson 1983). This is the space for reinterpreting critique in terms of anticolonial and postcolonial theory, but that would require a reconstruction of the concept of class.
As we shall see, the trajectory of Marx’s thought was different. Furthermore, it was taken and reinforced by later writers in a yet more explicitly Eurocentric direction. The societies whose social structures and forms of representation through estates were under review were already empires with significant subject populations. These populations, however, had no place in these theories, except as representatives of earlier stages of history, destined to be either eliminated or made part of a ‘civilising’ process. So far as Marx is concerned, they would be incorporated through a process of proletarianisation in which the European proletariat would be their vanguard – indeed, given the emphasis on learning, we might call it a socialising rather than civilising process. But first we will present the development of the idea of critique in Marx’s early writings."
"can you explain this to me I'm not understanding: In Marx we encounter a figure widely understood as central to the consolidation of modern sociological thought and as one of its ‘founding fathers’. That designation, however, is not straightforward. As we have seen, Talcott Parsons (1937) – whose construction of the classical canon was to be so influential during the 1960s, when sociology expanded and consolidated – placed the foundations of the discipline in 1890–1920 and related it primarily to Durkheim and Weber. He regarded Marx as a figure from the prehistory of social theory, whose valuable insights were better expressed by Weber (Holmwood 1996). The turn to Marx that took place in the 1960s and 1970s was due to dissatisfaction with Parsons’s seeming over-emphasis on processes associated with the maintenance of social order. For Parsons’s critics, Marx provided two missing elements: a concern with critique; and a concern with the class relations of the capitalist mode of production. The fact that Marx’s early writings were not well known at least until the 1950s meant that earlier interpretations could seem to have been based on an overly positivistic version of his thought that had made him seem outdated. His true significance could now be restored. The renewed interest in Marx represented by these sociological recuperations was primarily organised around the concepts of practical criticism (dialectics), class, and social change. Yet, as we shall argue in this chapter, colonialism disrupts each of these domains.
The previous two chapters have shown how European colonialism was central to the development of modern society, which would become the primary focus of social theory. Yet colonialism and its processes and institutions – private possession and displacement of populations, settlement, enslavement, and forced labour on plantations and in mines – have not been central topics of inquiry. Moreover, they have receded as concerns, even as colonies developed into empires. Hegel, for example, articulated a dialectics of recognition in terms of the master–slave relationship, but neglected the commodification of forced labour – chattel slavery – although this feature was integral to modern society. Equally, although he wrote at the same time as the Haitian Revolution, he was silent on its implications (Buck-Morss 2000). Freedom was not on the march, it would seem, in the Haitian resistance to the system of slavery and in the implementation of a constitution free of racial domination. Tocqueville, for his part, described the distinctive features of Anglo-American democracy separately from the circumstances of indigenous people and African Americans. When he did write about them, he acknowledged the racialised character of Anglo- American democracy; but, sharply pertinent though his analysis may be in many respects, it did not stop him from extolling that democracy. One could hardly say that he was troubled by the tyranny against African Americans and indigenous people, except to indicate the possibility of violence towards Anglo-American democracy. While Marx’s sensibility was very different – he was a fierce critic of colonialism – the structure of his thought was similar. He understood colonialism primarily as one of the forms of primitive accumulation, and imperialism followed from the logic of a capital–labour relation that was defined independently of it.
In this chapter we are concerned with the structure of Marx’s argument and not with the many comments he wrote on colonialism. Indeed, their detailed analysis and expectations of future developments were subordinated to that overall structure. In the discussion on class, for example, colonialism played a central part in explaining how ‘free labour’ came to be understood as the defining feature of capitalist class relations. Yet, as Cedric Robinson (1983) powerfully argued, racialised hierarchies explain to some extent why Marx’s expectations (immiserisation, proletarianisation, and social polarisation), which are based on the logic of capitalism, are confounded by the subsequent developments of national welfare states, which modify these outcomes for some citizens and not others. National welfare states incorporate a colonial patrimony that functions to the advantage of domestic populations and at the same time facilitates conventional social distinctions of status and gender that Marx had understood as subordinate to the dominant class relation. We pay particular attention to the early development of his thought; but our aim is not to provide a more nuanced account of his conception of class analysis. We suggest that his later thought is problematic just insofar as the concept of class is difficult to reconcile with the requirements of a postcolonial sociology, to which his earlier writings were intrinsically more open. In other words Marx was most open to colonialism before he discovered class and worked out the conceptual apparatus of the capitalist mode of production, in which this new category was embedded."
"this is both analysis and summary, put it together for my discursive notes: The masses of a colonial country and the nationalist political party are usually not on the same page. The colonized intellectuals, who make up most of the political parties, are dedicated to their parties, and they often hold politics above what is actually best for colonial society. The colonized intellectuals that make up the political parties are the most politically-conscious of colonial society. They are the tradesmen and civil servants—the urban proletariat—and they make up less than one percent of the actual population of a developing country.
In short, one percent of the country dictates how the other 99 percent live. This system is rooted in unfairness, and it will have important implications after independence. Once the colonial power leaves, the urban proletariat is still in power, and they continue to exploit the masses, leading to another form of neocolonialism. The urban proletariat operates with Western politics, which, Fanon maintains, must be discarded.

The urban proletariat is the most privileged of colonial society, and they have everything to lose by dismantling the colonial power. They are the taxi drivers, nurses, doctors, lawyers, and they are the “bourgeois” of colonial society. This national bourgeoisie is in conflict with the masses. They live Western lives and work Western jobs, and they see traditional native life as a barrier to growth. The national bourgeoisie also has Western political views, and they see the peasant masses as a barrier as well. They believe the masses are not politically conscious and generally disorganized. 
The national bourgeoisie looks at the peasant masses exactly as the colonialists do. They barely acknowledge their existence and nothing that they do is for the benefit of the peasants. The national bourgeoisie lives a very Westernized life, which can’t remain if the nation is truly decolonized. The bourgeoisie know this, and so they keep the peasants at arm’s length and try to maintain their own way of living.

The peasant masses are “staunch defender[s] of tradition,” and they distrust those who live in cities. They believe city dwellers to be morally bankrupt, and the city dwellers likewise look at the masses with suspicion. The colonialists know this, and they fan the flames of discontent by mobilizing the peasants against the city dwellers and fueling tribal identities. The political parties make no effort to reach out to the peasant masses, and they even ignore and publically ridicule traditional chiefs.
The peasant masses live fairly traditional lives and do not, as a general rule, live by Western standards as those in the cities do. The colonialists, Fanon implies, are always looking for ways to oppress and control. By playing the masses against one another, the colonialists get what they want (control of the nation) and the colonized move further away from independence.

The nationalist parties, as a general rule, are not against a revolt, but they wait for the peasant masses to do it for them. Nationalist parties don’t get directly involved in revolts, and they do not organize them in any way, but they are not averse to a sustained uprising. They avoid the revolting peasant and tell the colonial police they have nothing to do with rebellion. There are no meetings or talks between any of them, and this serves to reinforce the existing distrust between the masses and the nationalist parties.  
The nationalist parties see the peasant masses as tools at their disposal. They will use the peasants to man their revolution, but they make no effort to help them. Fanon repeatedly implies that the nation must come together to become independent, and he does so here as well. There are many chances to join forces between the peasants and the political parties, but they are not taken.

The distrust between the peasant masses and the nationalist parties in the colonial period extends into the national period. Therefore, the nationalist parties are tempted to keep “firm control” of the masses, as their opinion of the masses is much like the view of the colonists. They aren’t sure how the masses will react, and they approach them with extreme caution.
Again, the political parties look at the peasant masses as if the parties are colonialists, not nationalists. The parties want “firm control” of the masses, which again hearkens to neocolonialism. The peasants are not free, even after the colonial power is gone.

During the liberation struggle, the colonial country usually creates a national labor movement, which is another way for those in the cities to put pressure on the colonial power. Like the urban proletariat, the labor unions are made up of the same privileged workers who do not represent the population as a whole. In the colonial phase, the labor unions have the power to inforce strikes, which cripple the local colonial economy. But even during all this upheaval, the peasant masses remain completely unaffected by such political and economic happenings.   
Again, the peasant masses are unaffected because they do not live Western lives. If the economy crashes, they don’t feel the strain. They will eventually, Fanon argues, but initially it makes little difference to them. As Fanon points out, the political parties of the developing nation often act in ways that are counterproductive to the developing nation and beneficial to only the small urban proletariat.

Therefore, Fanon says, the labor unions aren’t exactly in step with the rest of the nation, either. The labor unions are completely isolated from the peasant masses, and they make little headway. Once depression and anxiety set in, in response to the realization that the new nation is going nowhere, the labor unions decide that politics must involve the whole nation, and they move to educate the peasant masses politically. The peasants are not immediately receptive. They are, after all, “the only spontaneously revolutionary force in the country,” and they have thus far been ignored. 
The key to independence, Fanon argues, is using the peasant masses in the right way. Fanon argues that government should be decentralized and moved closer to the peasant masses, and this passage reflects the reasons why. The peasants are easily ignored because they are removed from the cities. This, too, harkens to Fanon’s argument regarding mental health: colonialism is damaging to everyone involved.

Yet the peasant masses are crucial to the struggle for national liberation. For instance, when the rebels, who have been persecuted by the colonial police, begin to make waves and noise about liberation, they become the targets of colonial repression. They are arrested, convicted, tortured, and released; then they retreat to the countryside, where the peasant masses welcome them. The peasant masses are easily excited by the rebels’ talks of freedom, and the rebels are pleasantly surprised to find that the peasants look at their national struggle in much the same way. They, too, believe their revolt must be violent. They are ready to sacrifice, and, along with the rebels, they “can produce an explosive mixture of unexpected power.”
The rebels are revolutionaries who advocate for freedom and independence. When they start to express ideas of freedom, the colonial power arrests and tortures them, which again underscores the complete control and oppression of colonial rule. This “explosive mixture of unexpected power” is what Fanon says is necessary to win the struggle for nationhood. This again reflects Fanon’s central claim of the importance of violence in decolonization, as both the rebels and the peasants know their revolution will involve violence.

Rebellion upends political parties. Some political parties in colonial countries secretly align with the colonists and hope that rebellion fails. They see a rebellion ending only in bloodshed, and this causes the political parties to isolate. Before long, the leaders of the rebellion decide to take their fight to the cities, and they are largely successful because of the peasant masses who had been earlier forced into cities. Peasant life is tough, and it is not unheard of for some peasants to relocate to the cities looking for an easier life.
Bloodshed is not the only reason why the political parties don’t want a revolution. Decolonization will threaten their comfortable, Westernized lives, so they would prefer that the colonial power stay put, and their lives go on as usual. Of course, this sentiment isn’t shared by the peasant masses (99 percent of the population), and the nation is deeply divided by this paramount difference.

Peasant masses who relocate to the cities often find it hard to fit in, so when the rebellion comes to town, they are more than ready to join in the fight. Some of these peasants move from town to town, unable to find a place, living in makeshift shantytowns. These masses are the lumpenproletariat, and they are the “urban spearhead” of the rebellion. The lumpenproletariat are starving men who have no family or tribe, and they are “the most spontaneously and radically revolutionary forces of a colonized people.” 
Revolution, Fanon implies, cannot be accomplished without the lumpenproletariat. His description of them as the “spearhead” again points to the violence of revolution and colonialism. Again, the urban proletariat looks at the peasant in much the same way the colonialists do, which is why the proletariats do not easily accept the peasants into their society and why the lumpenproletariats must sleep in shantytowns.

In Kenya, during 1950 and ‘51, the British colonial police increased their tactics against the lumpenproletariat. During this time, there was a massive inflow of Kenyans from outlying rural areas, and they began to steal and debauch. Juvenile delinquency is usually associated with the lumpenproletariat, Fanon says. They are the “hooligans,” and they are a serious threat to the safety of colonial society. They believe in violence, guns, and hand grenades, and there are women among their ranks, too. Prostitutes and domestic workers are all part of the lumpenproletariat.
These “hooligans” are whom Fanon says will win the revolution. The lumpenproletariat is the lowest level of society. They are the violent criminals, which is precisely why they will be useful in the revolution. Revolution will take guns and hand grenades, Fanon says, and it is best to enlist the help of those who have experience using them.

The rebellion, with “a hatred for ‘politics’ and demagoguery,” mobilizes. The revolt grabs the attention of the colonial regime, which also mobilizes and threatens to diffuse the rebellion. But the rebellion cannot be swayed. They are driven forward by a belief that the nation must exist and that all foreigners must leave. In this heightened state of anxiety, the national cause strengthens and gains traction. “[S]pontaneity rules,” and the people are drawn together against the colonial force. If a nation lives anywhere, Fanon says, it must be here. During this time, there is a sense of unity. Old feuds are resolved, quarrels squashed, and political consciousness is infused with faith in the nation. There is solidarity among tribes and villages, and this unity spills over to the national level as well. Pretty soon, everyone is standing up.   
Fanon puts the word “politics” into quotations as if to imply that this form of politics shouldn’t really be considered as such. Again, he refers to politicians as “demagogues,” which means that their politics are rooted in their personal interests rather than what is in the best interest of the nation as a whole. Fanon frequently refers to “spontaneity” as the force needed for revolution, and he claims that the lumpenproletariat and the peasant masses are the only social classes who possess it. Even though they may be the only ones who initially have spontaneity, they do seem to be able to spread it.

Still, despite this optimism, losses to the rebellion are extensive, and those who live feel a massive sense of guilt. The rebellion, it seems, is destined to fail. The rebellion sees their members taken down by colonial machine gun fire, and they begin thinking that maybe rebellion isn’t such a good idea. In 1961 in Angola, Fanon says, the Angolan peasants were attacked by the Portuguese. Countless Angolans engaged the Portuguese, but the Angolans were littered with machine gun bullets. In the end, the Angolan National Army resorted to guerrilla warfare techniques.  Guerrilla warfare, Fanon says, is fighting on the move. Guerrilla soldiers move from town to town, sneaking up on their enemy in the dark. There is no strategy and no position, and just when the colonial police think that they are close to apprehending the guerrilla soldier, he comes from behind and ambushes the colonial forces.  
In the Algerian War of Independence, which Fanon was affiliated with and mentions several times in the book, guerrilla warfare was a major part the Algerian strategy that won the war. Fanon argues that guerrilla warfare is indispensable in the struggle for nationhood. The rebellion does not have the best weapons, or even enough people, by guerrilla tactics prove to be effective. This massive sense of guilt felt by survivors is more deeply explored in Fanon’s chapter on mental health, which implies that this guilt is a very real, and very destructive, force.

The rebellion soon discovers that they must formally form into an army and establish a central authority. They transform the rebellion into a revolutionary war and establish a clear set of objectives. The newly organized rebellion goes about fighting in a controlled and well-thought-out way, but this does not win national wars, Fanon says.
Fanon lays out several scenarios that won’t lead to independence, such as forming an army in the Western sense of the word. The Europeans can easily wipe out a centralized army and authority. Thus, such ideas should be avoided.

Colonialism has historically found ways in which to use the lumpenproletariat. Any national liberation movement, Fanon says, would do well to pay increased attention to the lumpenproletariat. They can always be convinced to revolt, and they have also been known to take up arms with the colonialists, who are more than willing to exploit the lumpenproletariat.
Essentially, the colonialists are more than happy to exploit the lumpenproletariats. They know what this social class is capable of, and they don’t want the lumpenproletariat to be utilized by the rebellion, either. Fanon portrays the lumpenproletariat in a way that suggests they will fight anyone if given the chance.

Racism and defending one’s skin are perfectly good reasons to join a struggle for liberation, but racism and hatred will not sustain a revolutionary war. The struggle for nationhood is not one that can be bridged with one step. It is a daily struggle with suffering that lasts far after the exit of the colonial power. Strength and rich reserves are needed, Fanon says, because “the reserves of colonialism are far richer and more substantial than of those of the colonized.”
The revolutionary war, Fanon implies, is deeper than anger and racism. It must be rooted in the struggle for the nation as a whole, which transcends race and is indifferent to anger. Racism and anger can give a boost to revolution, but in the end, it must be a desire for nationhood and nothing else that leads the struggle.

Those who embrace the Manichaeanism of the colonizer and believe in black against white realize that “some blacks can be whiter than whites, and that the prospect of a national flag or independence does not automatically result in certain segments of the population giving up their privileges and their interests.” There are those who will profit considerably from war at the expense of those who sacrificed so freely. While a revolution may banish colonial oppression, there is still another system of oppression building. The people of the nation must abandon their simple view of the oppressor, Fanon says, as it is changing right in front of them. 
Here, Fanon implies that being “white” isn’t necessarily the color of one’s skin, but the desire to subjugate and exploit those one feels are inferior. In this way, even the formerly colonized can behave in a way that is traditionally “white” or Manichaean. In this way, independence is not in the name of the flag or the nation, but in personal interests, and this cannot sustain a revolution or a new and developing nation.

Two Cheers for Democracy?
ADRIAN LEFTWICH
COMMENCING in the mid-1970s with the transition to democracy in Portugal and Spain, a 'third wave' of democratisation has been sweeping the world. It has been especially dramatic and widespread from the late 1980s, especially in the third world and eastern Europe.1 The minimal and formal definition of democracy used here is a system of politics and govern- ment in which individuals and political parties may compete for power (or a share of it) in open, free and regular elections. Though the degree of democra- tisation and the forms of constitutional arrangement vary greatly around the world, such democratic systems have been established or re-established in Latin America, Africa, eastern Europe and Asia. In 1973, no more than 40 per cent of the states in the world were formally democratic and less than 30 per cent could be said to have been liberal democracies. By 1995, however, formal democracies accounted for almost 60 per
cent of the states of the world.
Moreover, contrary to their practices during the Cold War, all western govern-
ments and most international institu- tions, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), now insist that authoritarian and military regimes give way to democratic good governance or forfeit aid and assistance. As the then British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd, wrote of his Govern- ment's aid policy in 1990: In practical terms, it means that we... will reward democratic governments and any politi- cal reform which leads to greater accountability and democracy. The corol- lary is that we should penalise particu-

larly bad cases of repression and huma rights [abuse].""2
However, during the first half of th 1990s the Russian attempt to bring Chechnya to heel, the US military opera tion to 'restore democracy' in Haiti and the continuing refusal of the Nigeria Government to protect or promot human rights, let alone return the coun try to democratic rule, are among the many examples which all point to a more universal and fundamental ques tion in politics which current officia thinking appears to ignore. The question is this. Is it possible to insert democracy into any society at any stage of its history irrespective of its social structure, it economic condition, its political tradi tions and its external relations? More sharply, is it not the case that there are certain conditions without which stable and sustainable democracy is improb able? And is it not clear that there are many countries in the world where these conditions simply do not exist as yet?
The imperial legacy
In the nineteenth century and well into the twentieth century it was standard imperial thinking in Europe (and espe cially in the United Kingdom) to insis that the colonial peoples required a very long period of 'tutelage' before they could be allowed to run democratic sys tems, let alone have their independence It was assumed that much social and economic development would have to occur before democracy would stick While such thinking may generally hav served to legitimate imperial interest

and to justify imperial reluctance to allow independence, these ideas had also been central to the great bulk of nineteenth- century social and political theory about the evolution and modernisation of socie- ties. Even in the years after the Second World War, when independence was achieved in colonial Asia and Africa, and especially during the Cold War, the West was not troubled at all by extending economic, political and often substantial military support to thoroughly undemo- cratic and often brutal regimes. This was especially so in relation to the military dictatorships in Latin America, but it was also true for most of the non-democratic regimes of Africa and key states across
Asia, such as Pakistan, Thailand, Indone- sia and South Korea. In order to defend its geo-strategic interests, the West lar- gely turned a blind eye to the absence of democracy and, often, grotesque abuses of human rights, in support of anti- Communist regimes. In defending just such a policy, one postwar US President made the obvious political point very sharply when he was alleged to have said (about the Latin American dictators): They may be sons of bitches but at least they are our sons of bitches.'
But even now, Western governments are not consistent. On the one hand, for instance, the Government of the United Kingdom (in concert with its Western allies) has withheld aid from the govern- ments of Kenya and Malawi as a means of twisting their arms to introduce demo- cratic reform. On the other hand, how- ever, the same Government has continued
to trade with and provide aid to China, despite that country's appalling human rights record, dramatised by the events of Tiananmen Square in 1989. As Baroness Chalker, Minister for Overseas Develop- ment in the Foreign Office, put it:
Why do we continue giving aid to China at even current modest levels for so large a country when elsewhere we appear much more ready to cut our aid? We do so because
The Political Quarterly Publishing Co. Ltd. 1996
we see that continued cooperation and dialo- gue is likely to be more effective in promoting improvements than cutting contacts. It would be counter-productive, both in political and commercial terms, to cut ourselves off from would not help those whose rights are China when any sanctions we imposed infringed, and our growing influence to help them would be diminished.
Despite this pragmatism of approach and patchiness of application, the current Western insistence on democratisation, good governance' and improvement in human rights records must be regarded as a very welcome U-turn in policy. For who could be against democracy? And who would not wish for human rights to be better protected and promoted? The problem, however, is that the West appears to assume that democracy can Russia or Rwanda, South Africa or work in any society-China or Chile, South Korea, Nepal or Nicaragua-and that it will not only last, but also promote economic growth and development.
But will it? Can the current wave of democratisation last? When will the first major reversals occur? Even if it were clear that democracy should be imposed, the question remains, can it be? The best way to answer these questions is to specify the conditions which appear to be necessary for sustainable and stable democratic politics. Experience suggests six main conditions. Although one or two may be absent in any one instance, there are no stable democratic political systems today where most of these do not apply.
Conditions for democracy
First, the state must enjoy geographical, constitutional and political legitimacy. That is, the people must accept the terri-
torial definition of the state and their place in it. They must regard the consti- tution-the formal structure of rules whereby political power is organised and distributed-as fair. And they must regard the regime of power, the Govern-

ment of the day, as being entitled to be there by fair electoral play. Without such legitimacy, the potential for violent regionalism or civil and secessionist wars is considerable, as we have seen so widely in Africa, but also more recently in India and Sri Lanka and now in Chechnya. Such unresolved conflicts pose profound threats to democracy.
Second, democratic politics requires a secure consensus about the rules of the political game and loyalty to the demo- cratic process itself. Losing parties in elections must accept the outcome and not defect or return to 'anti-democratic' practices, as happened in Burma, Haiti and Angola after the 1992 elections and also in Algeria, where the Government suspended the democratic process when it became clear that the fundamentalist Islamic Front was about to win and would itself abandon democratic proce- dures. Where democracy emerges (or re- emerges) from right-wing authoritarian- ism (as in most of Latin America, the Philippines and South Korea), the politi- cal forces associated with the old regime must commit themselves to democratic values and practices. Essentially, the troops must return to the barracks and stay there. But, equally, the left (for instance, the former ANC guerrillas in South Africa or the Nicaraguan Sandinis- tas) must commit itself to effective demo- bilisation, the ballot-box and committee rooms in their struggle for power or for influence over policy. Without these reci- procal movements towards an accep- tance of playing by the rules of the peaceful game, democracy can not work. Third, viable and sustained democracy also depends on the victorious party exercising policy restraint when in gov- ernment, however strong and under- stable the temptation to rewrite the policy book. That is to say, newly elected democratic governments may themselves endanger what may be a very fragile democracy if they pursue highly conten- tious policies too far or too fast where

there is no consensus about them, espe cially where these policies seriously threaten other major interests (nationa or foreign). This is one interpretation o what happened in Chile in the early 1970s when President Allende pursued radical policies which provoked an alli ance of domestic economic interests and the Chilean military to mount a bloody and violent coup, with the support o foreign corporations and the US Govern ment. By contrast, President Mandela': ANC Government in South Africa ha thus far been extremely careful not to threaten white economic interests or the interests of capital more generally.
There are, however, at least two majo problems with this. The first is that the followers and supporters of the new regime expect rapid and often radica policies of redistribution and may turn against 'their' government if these are not forthcoming. The second problem is that many new democratic governments inherit an economy in which grotesque degrees of inequality exist. Commonly these governments are committed to pro grammes of rapid economic growth and the promotion of the welfare of the poor And it is often the case in these circum stances that radical and essentially non consensual steps may be necessary ir order to lay the early foundations for such growth. Land reform (in Latin America, India and Pakistan) is a good example of this, since it is widely recog nised, even by the World Bank, that such reform can be an important condition of the agricultural and rural develop ment which is so crucial for the economi and social welfare of the broad mass o rural people, and hence for democrati stability.
The problem is that democrati regimes, like India, have found enor mous difficulty in overcoming vested rural interests in order to push through such land reforms. The same has been true in Pakistan, even in its democrati periods, such as under the regime o

Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. In both India and Pakistan, widespread landlessness and appalling rural inequality and poverty remain. On the other hand, and under strong pressure from the United States, non-democratic regimes in South Korea and Taiwan achieved far-reaching and successful land reform with very impor- tant and positive consequences for rural economic growth, equality and political stability, thereby laying the basis for the (thus far) successful democratisation of the last decade.
The central point here is that except where there is a wide cross-party con- sensus on some policy issue-as existed, for example, over the establishment of the welfare state in the United Kingdom after the Second World War-democratic
politics has never been the politics of radical change. Rather, democracy is the politics of accommodation, compromise, consensus and incrementalism. In short, it is the politics of conservatism, with a small 'c'. For many, that is its virtue; for others, its vice. But that is precisely what makes democracy so improbable in socie- ties polarised by sharp differences in income, class, ethnicity, culture or reli- gion where, initially, non-democratic cir- cumstances may be required to take the steps necessary to level the playing field. Fourth, stable and secure democracy has seldom been found in really poor societies. In these, the struggle for scarce resources and the enormous advantages which control of the state may bring to a party or faction makes democracy very unlikely since incum- bents will be very unwilling to lose con- trol. Moreover, these conditions are often associated with low levels of literacy, formal education and communication, as in the most depressing cases in sub- Saharan Africa. India and Jamaica may of course be cited as important exceptions to this; but over the last twenty years Indian democracy has looked increas- ingly shaky as it has been threatened first by regional tensions and, more

recently, by mounting religious conflict and Hindu fundamentalism. Nor has either Jamaica or India been able to lift the bulk of its people into jobs and out of poverty in the way that both China and South Korea were able to do under non- democratic circumstances.
Democracy is also unlikely in societies, whether poor or otherwise, where gross inequalities in wealth and income make consensus about the broad direction of public policy very difficult to achieve. By comparison with most Western demo- cracies, societies such as Brazil, Peru, Nigeria, South Africa and the Philippines are grotesquely unequal. Table 1 shows the share of income going to the top 10 per cent and bottom 20 per cent of the population in those countries, com- pared with the corresponding percen- tages for a sample of advanced democratic states.
These data show that the gap in income distribution in many developing countries is generally far greater than in the industrial societies. What are the implications for democratic survival? Simply stated, that the poor and their

parties will want rapid and radical redis- tribution, something the state and econ- omy may not be able to afford, and the rich will not want. But democratisation necessarily opens up political space, and the poor and their parties will be able to use that space to press their demands. As these demands increase in scope and intensity through the legitimate means of protests, mass action and strikes, the only way to forestall them is by the suspension of democracy, something which governments of both left and right have regularly done under such circumstances and are bound to do again. Fifth, while sharp ethnic or cultural differences (especially where they over- lap with religious divisions and material inequalities between the groups) are not inevitably a cause of conflict, in the absence of other countervailing condi- tions (such as consensus about constitu- tions which seek to balance power between such groups), it is not easy to establish or sustain democracy where they exist. The African continent provides some of the most striking examples of ethno-cultural conflicts, as in the continu- ing instability in Nigeria, Angola and Sudan, not to mention the recent (but not new) bloodshed in Rwanda. Closer to Europe, the awful spectacle of Yugo- slavian disintegration, with its special contribution of 'ethnic cleansing', illus- trates the point graphically. Elsewhere, intense religious conflicts erode the pro- spects of a consensual basis for demo- cratic politics and thus threaten it. This is best illustrated by the increasingly hostile and sometimes violent confronta- tions within Islam, as in Algeria, Egypt and Bangladesh, and by the rise of Hindu fundamentalism in India or Jewish fun- damentalism in Israel. In all these coun- tries ethnic or religious differences become the contours along which politi- cal mobilisation flows, often with stark consequences. Conflict between the Chi- nese and Malays in Malaysia in the 1960s and in Fiji between native Fijians and

Indians in the late 1980s are further exam ples of this ethno-cultural problem fo democracy. Not until the pull of ethnic religious or cultural loyalty is confined to the private sphere and hence dispersed in favour of a widespread commitment to common, public and above all secula citizenship will democratic political pro
cesses be secured.
Sixth, major transformations of the economic and political structure of socie ties are not easily accomplished unde democratic circumstances. This is wha the Chinese leadership have pointed ou in defence of their claim that strong and non-democratic regimes are necessary to manage major economic reform. And it is precisely what the Cubans say as they take the first steps in the direction of liberalising the economy.
Both Russia and South Africa, in thei different ways, are classic current illustra tions of the problems which have to be faced if major economic changes are initiated under democratic conditions. In Russia, a state-run economy is being privatised under democratic circum- stances. Inflation, declining output shortages, depressed incomes and disin- tegrating welfare services do not go easily with stable democracy, as the first half of the 1990s has shown. In South Africa, the white monopoly of political power has been broken up. But how far can the new regime go in reforming the structure of economic power? In both cases, major changes in the distribution of economic and political resources will produce new winners and new losers, thus provoking outbreaks of violence which may easily escalate into full-scale civil conflict and decay. Such conflicts have thus far been more manifest in Russia than in South Africa. But it is far from clear yet whether either of these long and complex transi- tions will be completed under democratic conditions or whether either will be able to sustain democracy while simulta- neously promoting urgently needed eco- nomic growth.

Democracy: an alien plant?
The implications of all this are uncomfor- table. Some countries, including perhaps Hungary, Taiwan, South Korea and Chile, which have emerged or re-emerged into democracy from more or less lengthy but intense periods of non-democratic eco- nomic development, may sustain demo- cracy as Spain and Portugal have done since the 1970s. They appear at least to have achieved the material and secular basis for democracy. If they do sustain their achievement, they will join the rela- tively small group of third world demo- cracies that includes Costa Rica, Jamaica, Botswana, Mauritius, Singapore, Malay- sia and (shakily) India.
But in many other places it may well turn out to be the case that democracy is premature in timing, inappropriate in circumstance and alien in provenance, in the sense conveyed by a Fiji Times editorial in 1992 which described demo- cracy as a 'foreign flower', unlikely to take root in Fijian soil. That is to say, democracy has not emerged endogen- ously through organic processes within individual societies but has been imposed.
Perhaps by the year 2000 it will have become clear that the old orthodoxy was right: that too few of the conditions which sustain democracy have been established in too many societies. On
Nigeria and Niger, or threaten to seize power, as in Venezuela (twice). In the major Latin American states of Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, poor (in some, negative) rates of average annual eco- nomic growth over the last fifteen years, deepening inequality and escalating social unrest under democracy, and the pressures of economic liberalisation are not good omens. Many states in sub- Saharan Africa are in an even worse position.
It is for these reasons that we must expect more democratic reversals in the last five years of the twentieth century. And once a few democracies are sus- pended or overturned, it will become easier for others to follow.
Perhaps, then, instead of insisting blindly on democracy, what the West should do is to support only those dedi- cated and determined developmental elites which are seriously bent on pro- moting economic growth, whether demo- cratic or not. For by helping them to raise the level of economic development it will help them also to establish or consolidate the real internal conditions for lasting democracy. Without these conditions, the best we can do at the moment is (in E. M. Forster's words) to give only two cheers for democracy.

Theories of democratization have been concerned chiefly with causation and the identification of the main factors that lead to the emergence of democracies. Most explanations of democratization draw upon elements of three distinct approaches: modernization theory; historical sociology (sometimes called structuralism); and transition theory (also known as agency theory). Sometimes a distinction is made simply between struc- turalist theories (modernization and historical sociology) and agency approaches (transition theory) because of their very different positions regarding structure and agency. This chapter explains these different approaches and examines how they have been used in the literature on contemporary democratization. It should be remembered that all theo- ries are attempts to impose order and find patterns in the messy and complex reality of human life; to some extent, therefore, theories are bound to be parsimonious and partial explanations. On its own, no single theory will explain completely a particular case. But the theories are useful in that they ask important questions about democratization in general and contribute to particular explanations.
As more democracies were created in the 1990s, a focus on consoli- dation, or the factors that make democracy endure, also crept into the debate. All three approaches have something different to contribute to the debate about consolidation. However, they all also have very significant limitations in this regard. Consequently, the chapter proposes an alternative focus, which analyzes democratizations through three key dimensions, namely the state, civil society and globalization.
Modernization Theory
For Giddens (1990), modernity is inherently globalizing, that is it spreads across the world, creating one uniform culture. Modernization theory, in other words, implicitly links democratization with globaliza-
46
tion. It links the spread of democracy to modernity and the Enlightenment idea of the universality of progress. It was codified within democratization studies by Seymour Martin Lipset (1959) and draws on a mix of Weberian notions of the ‘modern’ state and the pre- occupation of classical sociology with describing the social transitions – from feudalism to capitalism, from traditional to modern, from ascrip- tion to achievement – which occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Talcott Parsons’s (1951) work is a modern expression of clas- sical sociology’s tendency to classify societies in terms of simple oppo- sitions. He identified modernity as a passage from diffuseness to specificity and from particularism to universalism. In modernization theory, the characteristics he identifies as those of modernity are gener- ally laid down as benchmarks for all developing or non-democratic societies to achieve.
Modernity is equated with the processes of change which had occurred in the nineteenth century in the Atlantic societies of Britain and the US and, to a lesser extent, within Western Europe generally. A modern society, then, is essentially a product of capitalism. Lipset pre- sumed that modernity was a single universal experience, leading to essentially similar societies and states. As a theory of change, modern- ization is functionalist and economistic, in that it sees democracy as an outcome of capitalism. It associates economic growth in a causal rela- tionship with progress. Modernization is also predictive: democracy appears in those societies that are able to ‘replicate the original transi- tion’ to capitalism (Roxborough 1979) and become enmeshed in global economic structures.
According to Lipset, capitalism is the heart of democracy because it produced wealth (which he unproblematically assumed would trickle down and lead to higher levels of mass consumption), led to an educated middle class and produced a number of cultural changes favourable to democracy, such as increased secularism and a diminution in ascriptive and primordial identities. He suggested that one link between capital- ism and democracy was that capitalism diminished class conflict:
For the lower strata, economic development, which means increased income, greater economic security and higher education, permits those in this status to develop longer time perspectives and more complex and gradualist views of politics. A belief in secular reformist gradualism can only be the ideology of a relatively well-to-do lower class. Increased wealth and education also serve democracy by increasing the extent to which the lower strata are exposed to cross pressures which will reduce the intensity of their commitment to given ideologies and make them less receptive to supporting extrem- ist ones. ... Increased wealth is not only related causally to the devel- opment of democracy by changing the social conditions of the workers, but it also affects the political role of the middle class through changing the shape of the stratification structure so that it shifts from an elongated pyramid with a large lower-class base, to a diamond with a growing middle class. A large middle class plays a mitigating role in moderating conflict since it is able to reward moderate and democratic parties and penalize extremist groups. (Lipset 1959: 78)
Lipset’s notion of capitalism as the source of democracy was strength- ened by the work of some development economists such as Walt Rostow in the 1960s. Rostow (1960) identified a lineal path for economic devel- opment along defined ‘stages’, as they were termed, until capitalism was achieved. These ‘stages’ were: the traditional society; the pre-take-off society; take-off; the road to maturity; and the mass consumption society. They thus parallel the classic sociological tradition of concep- tualizing political and social change as part of a transition from tradi- tionalism to modernity.
Lipset’s work was also contemporaneous with theory-building efforts by a number of scholars around the relationship between political culture and democratization (Pye and Verba 1965; Almond and Verba 1963). Modernization was frequently associated with this work, which linked democracy to a particular political culture – one which chan- nelled mass participation in an orderly, non-mobilizing and low-key fashion and encouraged secular and elite-led government. While the emphasis of the political culture school was somewhat different from that of Lipset – it sought to explain the difficulties societies encountered in becoming ‘modern’ – the work of political development scholars increased the acceptability of Lipset’s thesis by linking material progress and democracy to modernity. This emphasis on culture has re-emerged in studies of contemporary democratization.
Evaluating Modernization Theory
Modernization is an attempt to theorize the fact that democracies have emerged in the modern world under capitalism. It has tried to specify the particular components of capitalism that make for democracy. That is its strength. However, it assumes an overly simple and lineal rela-
tionship between capitalism and democracy. As a result, it has been sug- gested that modernization theory is ahistorical, ethnocentric and overly structural. Doubts have also been expressed about the typical method- ology employed within modernization studies.
Modernization is ahistorical in that it presumes that all societies can replicate a transition which actually occurred at a particular moment in space and time. It does not recognize the difficulties – indeed the impos- sibility – of one society copying what occurred in a different society at a different time, nor the changes which have taken place globally which mean that capitalism is now a global order rather than an economic system confined within the territorial boundaries of particular nation states. Critics of modernization have suggested that late development has in fact led to a malign version of modernity marked by authoritian capitalism rather than democracy (Frank 1971; Cardoso and Faletto 1979). O’Donnell ‘s (1973) influential theory of bureaucratic authori- tarianism identifies the deepening of capitalism in developing countries with the emergence not of democracies but of dictatorships. He sug- gests that a numerically small but politically powerful bourgeoisie uses the state to maximize profit through repression. For these critics, mod- ernization’s assumption that capitalism was the source of democracy was empirically invalid and theoretically facile. From a rather different perspective, Beetham (1997) has also suggested that the idea that the market is inevitably supportive of democracy, as modernization assumes, is unsustainable. Markets can both support and undermine democracy. Finally, because modernization ignores the particular devel- opment processes of the third world and has extrapolated out of the experiences of the Western world a ‘rule’ for the entire planet, modern- ization is also inherently ethnocentric.
The idea that modernization is an overly structural explanation of political change is a critique of a different order. Rather than attacking the fundamental assumptions of modernization, it is suggested that the role of structure (that is, capitalism) is exaggerated at the expense of human action. In other words, modernization leaves politics out and should be criticized ‘for being overly concerned with structures and therefore assuming that the behaviour of people – whether classes, groups or individuals – is epiphenomenal and ultimately reducible to material or other conditions’ (Schmitz and Sell 1999: 24).
Finally, modernization theory has also been subject to a methodolog- ical critique. Lipset’s method was to categorize all countries in terms of being ‘more or less democratic’. He tested this by using two variables, wealth and education, and found that the average wealth ... and level of education was much higher for the democratic countries (Lipset 1959). He then used this to suggest causation. Put simply, Lipset claimed to have proved that more telephones, more cars, more consumption – in sum, more capitalism – leads to more democracy. Even scholars broadly sympathetic to modernization’s underlying thesis have found themselves forced to reduce these sweeping claims. Diamond (1992), for example, points out that Lipset’s own data indicated higher levels of economic development within European non-democracies than in Latin American democracies, suggesting that democracy required the presence of factors other than economic growth. Vanhanen (1990) and Hadenius (1992) have also modified Lipset’s claim, from causality to one of correlation. Przeworski and Limongi (1997) suggest that the evidence supports the thesis that democracy survives better in wealthier nations but not the original proposition that democracy is a simple consequence of eco- nomic growth.
Modernization Theory Today
Leftwich (1996) offers the most forceful contemporary restatement of modernization. He applies it, logically enough, only to developing states. He argues that economic development, whether in a democratic political setting or not, will inevitably produce democracy in the long term. As a result he recommends that: ‘the West should ... support only those dedicated and determined developmental elites which are seri- ously bent on promoting economic growth, whether democratic or not. For by helping them to raise the level of economic development it will help them also to establish or consolidate the real internal conditions for lasting democracy’ (Leftwich 1996: 329; italics in the orginal).
It is rare, however, for modernization to have survived in such an unre- formed way. Generally, today’s modernizationists do not claim direct causality between capitalism and democracy. Diamond has been partic- ularly influential in updating modernization theory. He has picked up the 1960s concern with mass participation and political culture in newly ‘modernized’ states and emphasizes, in particular, the role of political culture and a dynamic civil society for democratization. In the process, he has shifted modernization away from a discussion on the causes of democracy towards a focus on consolidation. He argues that long-term democratic consolidation must encompass a shift in political culture (Diamond 1999). Emphasizing the role of civil society and civic free- doms means, in fact, that he is pessimistic about the chances for sustained democratization in much of the developing world because civil society
is frequently poorly articulated and weak, and the political culture of institutions and electoral regimes is ‘shallow, exclusive, unaccountable and abusive of individual and group rights’ (Diamond 1996: 34).
Diamond’s work is of considerable academic importance. But this new version of modernization theory is just as profoundly embedded in Western policy-making circles. For Cammack (1994), its success is due to the fact that it addresses a major issue in global politics, namely the difficulties of governance in an era of mass participation, and, further- more, it does so from the perspective of conservative global elites. Not surprisingly, then, modernization remains the vision behind a number of democracy-promoting initiatives, especially those emerging from US governmental circles. In sum, modernization theory retains vitality and influence through its ability to identify the apparent link between capi- talism and democracy. However it is unable to explain why trends to democratization are so often contradictory and partial."
"summarise this text: Voting turnout
Voting is the most basic and simple duty of the citizen, so voting turnout is often treated as a good measure of the basic health of a democracy. Unfortunately,
there are two problems with this:
•  First, does low turnout indicate an alienated and dissatisied electorate, or, on the contrary, one that is satisied and happy to let politicians get on with it? History suggests that sudden and large increases in turnout indicate widespread dissatisfaction. The sudden jump in voting turn- out in Germany in 1933, when Hitler’s nazi Party won, was the result of alienated people deciding to cast a protest vote. equally, the
arrival of an unusually popular candidate or party can mobilise voters (the USA in 2008). •  The second dificulty of using turnout as a indicator of democratic health is that there are two different measures of turnout, and a lot turns on which one is used:
– Voting as a percentage of the voting-age population, usually all adult citizens, or
– Voting as a percentage of those on the electoral register.
Some countries make it easy to register, and some even register people auto- matically when they register themselves as residents or pay their taxes. Other countries make it more dificult, or even discriminate against certain groups. As a result, the percentage of all adults on the register can vary quite signii- cantly between countries. There can, therefore, be a big difference between turnout igures according to which of the two measures is used. It is thus important to make it clear which baseline – adult
population or registered electorate – is used. It is
also important to use one or the other consist-
ently when comparing countries. There is the
further complication that some countries make voting in national elections compulsory. Although this may be observed in theory more than practice, it does complicate comparisons (see fact ile 12.1).
Declining turnout?
Although it is common to lament a decline in turnout, especially when it is interpreted as a sign of disillusionment with democracy, the facts sug- gest otherwise. In the established democracies (countries that have been democratic for twenty years or more) turnout as a percentage of the voting- age population rose from around 70 per cent in the 1940s to around 75 per cent in the 1950s. This igure remained fairly constant over the 1960s and 1970s and then declined slightly to around 70 per cent by 1997. This does sug- gest a slight fall, but only to the previous lower level, and it is not clear how much this decline is due to changing socio-demographic patterns, or to grow- ing apathy, alienation or political satisfaction. Some groups in the population with a typically low turnout have tended to increase in size – the old, the ill, students, immigrants and ethnic and language minorities. In short, turnout across the democratic states has not declined very much, and even this may be the result of socio-demographic change as much as disillusionment with democracy and voter apathy.
Determinants of election turnout
There are considerable variations in voting turnout in the democracies (see table 12.2). In Italy, Iceland and South Africa it is above 85 per cent, but in the dominican Republic, Poland, Switzerland and the USA it is below 50 per cent. Why is this? Many factors seem to affect turnout, and they may be conveniently grouped under two categories: system and individual inluences.
System variables
We can distinguish nine of these:
1. The importance of the election Citizens are more likely to vote if they think the election is important. They turn out in larger numbers for national than for local government elections, and for the election of executive presidents and
lower chambers rather than upper chambers and weak assemblies. The democratic deficit of the institutions of the eU, especially the european Parliament (eP), is said to be partly responsible for the low turnout in the eU.
2. Democracy Turnout in established democracies with entrenched political freedoms and civil liberaties is higher than in non-democracies.
3. Electoral system PR voting systems have a higher turnout than other sys- tems (see brieing 12.1). Countries with automatic or easily used registra- tion systems also have a higher turnout than others.
4. Close, competitive elections Close elections, where every vote counts, tend to have a higher turnout, as do competitive elections (where the largest party wins less than 50 per cent of the vote).
5. Left parties elections that manage to mobilise sections of the population with a low voting turnout will usually register a higher turnout – for example, where left-wing parties appeal to working-class voters. . Frequency of election Citizens who are often called out to vote seem to suffer from ‘election fatigue’.
7. Founding elections It is often believed that ‘founding elections’ (the irst democratic elections after authoritarian rule) have high turnouts. One thinks of the long queues at polling stations in the irst democratic election in South Africa in 1994. An examination of election statistics, however, shows that this turns out to be true of central and eastern europe, but not
generally of other parts of the world.
8. Presidential and parliamentary elections In parliamentary elections in the
second half of the twentieth century turnout was a good 20 per cent higher than presidential turnout, but by 1997, the two were virtually identical. At the same time, presidential elections increased from 30 per cent of all elections to more than 50 per cent in 1999, so it is not clear whether presidential turnout has changed, or whether presidential elec- tions are now held in a different set of countries affected by different turnout factors.
9. Community characteristics Socially homogeneous communities (pre- dominantly in terms of class, religion, language or ethnic group) with a sense of solidarity often have high levels of social and political participation.
Individual characteristics We can distinguish four of these:
1. The standard model The standard model of political participation, described in chapter 9, applies to voting turnout as well, but as with political participation its inluence on voting
behaviour is also declining. The higher an individual’s position in the social stratification system, as measured by caste, class, status, income or education, the more likely they are to vote.
2. Age, gender, length of residence and race The standard model of voter turnout may be modi- ied by other variables. Young and old people are less likely to vote, so also are women and
members of minority groups – unless minorities are mobilised by their own political organisations or political issues relevant to them. Long-term residents with roots in the community are more likely to vote than more mobile people.
3. Party identification Individuals with a strong party identification (party ID) are more likely to vote.
4. Values Post-materialist values, it is said, promote participation and civic responsibility.
■■ Party voting
Although there is a great deal of variation in party voting across the demo- cratic world, it is also possible to advance some generalisations about voting patterns and the way they are changing with respect to economic issues and social stratiication, race and religion, and urban–rural cleavages. Economic voting and stratification
economic issues are intimately linked with
some of the most basic conditions of daily life –
not just money but housing, health, education
and family prospects. Therefore there is often
a link between the economy and voting, as in the commonly observed ten- dency for working-class and poor social groups to vote for parties of the left, and for wealthier groups to favour the centre or right. There is also a tendency for voters to punish governments that perform badly on economic matters. But, and it is an important but, economic voting is dependent on four other factors.
1. non-economic cleavages may override economic ones. A large working- class, left-wing party has not emerged in India, in spite of widespread poverty, because of the strength of race, religious, language and regional cleavages. In contrast, class voting was particularly strong in the UK and Australia, when class was the dominant cleavage and there were few other cleavages.
2. The extent to which voters reward or punish their government for its economic performance depends on how clear it is that the government is responsible for economic performance: government coalition partners blame each other for failures; higher levels of government blame lower levels and vice versa; presidents blame legislatures and vice versa; and poor government performance may count for little if voters believe that opposition parties would do worse.
3. Voters learn about government economic performance in different ways, at different times and with different effects. They are more likely to for- give the poor performance of parties they identify with and vote for (the ‘home team’ effect).
4. Class is a largely objective way of grouping people based on income and occupation, but status is more subjective, based on how people spend their money and how others see them,
judged according to such things as their
behaviour, education, manner of speech,
clothes and life-style. People who believe
they are middle class may behave politically as the middle class does, even though economically they are not the same. People from high-status backgrounds who have fallen on hard economic times can retain their high status even though they are impoverished, and equally those from poor backgrounds who have made a lot of money may be regarded as vul- gar and nouveau riche. A combined measure of class and status is referred to as ‘socio-economic status’.
For much of the late nineteenth and the twentieth century class voting was common in western europe. It is argued that by 1920 the party systems of most of these countries had frozen around their main class cleavage and largely remained that way until the 1970s. during this period the left– right dimension was the most important in their politics (see brieing 12.2). However, when economic changes brought about a change and weakening of class structures, other social divisions became more important for voting. One of the most important is religion.
Religious voting
Religion has been a major source of political conlict for most of the world’s history, and it remains a major, if not the major, social and political div- ision in some democratic countries. In India, conlict between Muslims and Hindus is an acute political issue and Hindu fundamentalism is the basis of the Bharatiya janata Party (BjP), which became the governing party in 1998. Religious issues and voting patterns were strong in much of europe and are still strong in the USA. Religion, ethnicity and language are frequently closely associated, but sometimes the same ethnic group and language groups can be divided along religious lines.
While it is not surprising that religion is a basic foundation of political life in religious societies, it also continues to be a major inluence on voting behaviour even in the secular parts of western europe, where churches and the state came to a formal settlement centuries ago (see chapter 1). In fact, as class voting tends to decline, so religious voting, which has maintained its strength, emerges as being relatively more important (table 12.3). Religious voting tends to be more complex than class voting, since there is no simple working-class–middle-class/left–right cleavage. Instead there is a more com- plex set of divisions between many different churches and faiths – includ- ing the formation of secular parties in opposition to religious ones, in some countries.
What makes the existence of persistent religious differences all the more interesting and important is that politicians in secular societies usually try to push religious issues, such as abortion or matters of faith, off the political agenda. These are highly charged moral and emotional issues of the kind that politicians try to avoid. nevertheless, religious cleavages that usually emerged a long time ago, even before the creation of democratic elections and party systems, are still relevant.
Perhaps the most conspicuous example of the connection between religion and politics is the emergence of Christian democratic parties and unions (see chapter 13) – some small and weak, others large and powerful – in thirty of the democracies of the world from Finland to Chile and Canada to South Africa. Christian democracy is noticeably absent from Asian politics, where other religions are important. Other voting patterns
Few things rival class and religion as the major inluences on party voting across the broad sweep of modern democracies, but other factors can play a signiicant role:
•  Most countries have urban–rural differences, for example, and more espe- cially regional variations in party voting. The latter are particularly likely to be associated with ethnic, religious, class, or language differences, as they are in Belgium, Canada, Italy and Spain. India stands out in this respect as well.
•  There is a slight gender gap in some societies, although it is rarely of great importance compared with religion or stratiication.
•  Race and ethnicity, important in some of the newer democracies, has also gained in importance in the older ones as a result of global migration patterns.
Chile in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries demonstrates many aspects of the relationships between social cleavages and politics, particularly insofar as inequality, religion, class and region are concerned. The Spanish conquest of the country created a dominant white, Catholic, ruling class and a coerced labour force consisting of the indigenous population that worked on farms and in mines. As the economy and society developed in the nineteenth cen- tury it created social and economic groups, including a middle class, and a set of regional, anti-clerical and economic elites. But Chile has long had a tradition of constitutional and multi-party government, and it succeeded in gradually accommodating these interests into the political system in a largely peaceful manner (see brieing 12.3).
New party voting patterns
Social and economic changes (some brought about by government policies) have had a strong inluence on voting patterns. In the industrialising dem- ocracies, the decline of the agricultural sector and the growth of the cities
populated by the working class and the poor have had a profound impact on the strength of parties and the nature of old social cleavages based on urban–rural differences, regions and ethnic concentrations. In the older democracies of western europe, the old pattern of class pol- itics, and the left–right party system associated with it, shows clear signs of ‘unfreezing’. Class is less important than it was and there is evidence that class (and party) de-alignment and parti- san de-alignment has caused voting patterns to show more volatility.
 Class de-alignment Decline in the class- based strength of attachment to class-based political parties.
 Partisan de-alignment Decline in the strength of attachment to political parties.
 Volatility The opposite of stability, volatil- ity involves change in voting patterns from one election to another. Some refer to it as ‘churning’.
258 The reasons for changing voting patterns, therefore, are many and varied but they include several common developments:
•  Industrialising societies have often mixed old stratiication factors based on caste, religion and ethnicity with new class and status distinctions. Post-industrial societies, in contrast, have tended to increase their propor- tion of middle-class people, while fragmenting both working- and middle- class strata into smaller sub-groups. This has weakened class voting.
•  Urban–rural differences have declined with a shrinking agricultural sec- tor, particularly where the urban and rural poor have formed a political alliance in industrialising countries.
•  education has created a more independently minded electorate that is less bound by class identities. Social mobility between classes has strength- ened this.
•  The mass media, especially television, have become more important.

Briefing 12.3
Cleavages and politics: Chile
Republican political institutions were able to take root in Chile in the nineteenth century before new social groups demanded participation. Contenders from the middle and lower classes were gradually assimilated into an accommodating political system in which most disputes were settled peacefully, although disruptions related to the demands of workers often met a harsh, violent response. The system expanded to incorporate more and more competing regional, anti-clerical and economic elites in the nineteenth century. The middle classes gained political offices and welfare benefits in the opening decades of the twentieth century. From the 1920s to the 1940s, urban labourers obtained unionisation rights and participated in reformist govern- ments. In the 1950s, women finally exercised full suffrage and became a decisive electoral force. And by the 1960s, rural workers achieved influence with reformist parties, widespread unionisation and land reform.
As Chile’s political parties grew, they attracted followers not only on the basis of ideology but also on the basis of patron–client relationships between candidates and voters. These ties were particularly important at the local level, where mediation with government agencies, provision of public employment and delivery of public services were more crucial than ideological battles waged on the national stage. Over generations, these bonds became tightly woven, producing within the parties fervent and exclusive sub-cultures nurtured in the family, the community and the workplace. As a result, by the mid-twentieth century the parties had politicised schools, unions, professional associations, the media and virtually all other components of national
life. The intense politicisation of modern Chile has its roots in events of the nineteenth cen- tury in spite of later twentieth-century developments including military coup, dictatorship and democratisation.
(For a more detailed analysis of Chile’s cleavage politics, see http://workmall.com/wfb2001/chile/chile_history_historical_setting.html)  new parties have emerged and old parties have shifted their policies in an attempt to broaden their appeal and to respond to the demands of new social groups. In some cases, the old parties have stolen policies from the new parties and social movements in their attempt to maintain their electoral appeal.
•  The basic bread-and-butter issues of poverty, work, health, housing and education have become even sharper in industrialising democracies, whereas the environment, nuclear issues, gender and minority rights, and (in europe) european integration, have often cut across the old politics of class in post-industrial societies.
The result of these far-reaching changes in socio-economic patterns is increased volatility and unpredictability in voting patterns in both new and old democracies. nevertheless, talk of revo- lutionary and radical transformation is often exaggerated. Changes are usually gradual and involve fusions of the old and the new, and shifts of degree rather than kind. In some cases, even partisan re-alignment can be observed. Social stratiication and religion remain the basic sources for politi-
cal mobilisation, even if the nature of the stratiication is shifting.
Tradition and change in Mexico
We can see the interplay of tradition and change in the electoral politics of Mexico, where economic inequalities of class are superimposed on old ethnic divisions. The Mexican social and political elite is composed of the criollos, people of pure Spanish ancestry dating back to the invasion of Mexico in the sixteenth century by the Spanish conquistador, Hernán Cortés. The middle layer of society is made up of people of mixed blood, the mestizos with Spanish and indigenous Mayan and Aztec backgrounds. For sixty years, Mexico had an authoritarian system of government based on electoral manipulation and the the ability of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to unite the interests of these groups and those of the lowest class, the indigena, by bringing them together in a corporatist structure (see chapter 10). The structure however, largely excluded the interests of the very poorest section of society, the rural farmers who were concentrated in the south of Mexico and consisted mainly of people of Mayan background.
On new Year’s day 1994, the revolutionary national Liberation Front (nLF, the Zapatistas) burst into armed guerrilla activity that shook the founda- tions of the state and the governing PRI. Zapatista demands were economic, regional and ethnic. They wanted a better economic deal for poor farmers, who were mainly of Aztec origin and concentrated in Chiapas in the south of Mexico. Two remodelled parties emerged to challenge the hegemony of the PRI, both representing class interests. The democratic Revolutionary Party (PRd, founded in 1989) is supported mainly by poor urban and rural people, and the national Action Party (PAn, founded in 1939) mainly by upper-income groups. PAn captured the presidency in 2000.
The Mexican case illustrates several points about changing voting patterns:
•  Change is usually mixed with tradition.
•  Voting is based on a mixture of factors involving social stratiication and
inequality, ethnicity and regional and urban–rural differences. Religious dif-
ferences are not important in Mexico because it is 90 per cent Catholic.
•  History is important. The Zapatista movement is the result of the subju- gation of the Mayan and Aztec populations in the sixteenth century, and the 1990s movement named itself after the revolutionary leader emiliano Zapata (1879–1919), who fought for the rights of poor farmers. Politics is important. Poor farmers lived in Mexico for centuries, but it was the charismatic leader ‘Subcomandante’ Marcos who organised a rebellion in 1994, which had a subsequent inluence on the formation of new parties."

"as a comparative politics expert, explain this in detail. do it in a discoursive way following the authors train, also it has to be extremely detailed. keep the in-text citations : For nearly a century, political scientists have developed typologies and models of political parties in an effort to capture the essential features of the partisan organizations that were the objects of their analysis. The end result is that the literature today is rich with various categories of party types, some of which have acquired the status of ‘classics’ and have been used by scholars for decades (e.g. Duverger, 1954; Kirchheimer, 1966; Neumann, 1956). We believe, however, that the existing models of political parties do not adequately capture the full range of variation in party types found in the world today, and that the various typologies of parties, based on a wide variety of definitional criteria, have not been conducive to cumulative theory- building. This article, therefore, is an attempt to re-evaluate the prevailing typologies of political parties, retaining widely used concepts and terminol- ogy wherever possible, consolidating and clarifying party models in some cases, and defining new party types in others. This is for several reasons.
First, nearly all of the existing typologies of political parties were derived from studies of West European parties over the past century and a half. Accordingly, some of their distinguishing features are products of that particular temporal and geographical context. Parties that have emerged more recently, as well as those functioning in other parts of the world, have been substantially affected by greatly different social and technological environments. This is certainly true of parties in developing countries whose populations exhibit considerable ethnic, religious and/or linguistic diversity, upon which competitive parties have most commonly been based. It is even true of the United States, whose two highly decentralized parties fit uneasily with most existing party typologies (see Beck, 1997).
Similarly, many of the parties that first emerged in the late twentieth century have prominent features that cannot be captured using classic party typologies developed a century earlier. In this later period of party develop- ment, television (which did not exist at the time the classic party typologies were formulated) had unequivocally become the most important medium of political communication between candidates and voters in nearly all modern democracies (see Gunther and Mughan, 2000). This medium systematically privileges the personalities of party leaders over presentation of party pro- grammes or ideology, at the same time as it greatly reduces the utility of mass membership as a vehicle for electoral mobilization. Also in the late twentieth century, public opinion polling and ‘focus groups’ have been increasingly employed, facilitating the crafting of ad hoc electoral appeals, at the expense of long-standing ideological principles, programmatic com- mitments and constituency interests. Finally, fundamental features of mass culture and social structure had also changed profoundly by the late twen- tieth century: extreme economic inequality and the high political salience of the class cleavage had declined in many countries, while new political con- flicts growing out of ‘post-materialist’ values had begun to affect partisan politics.
In the absence of an expanded and updated typology of parties, the small number of party models that make up the most commonly used typologies has often led to an excessive ‘concept stretching’. Inappropriate labels have been applied to newly emerging parties whose characteristics depart markedly from those which went into the original definition of the party model. In effect, this represents an effort to cram square pegs into round holes. Both empirical studies and theory-building can be weakened by unwarranted assumptions of commonalities (if not uniformity) among parties that are, in fact, quite varied, and by the inappropriate application of labels to parties whose organizational, ideological or strategic character- istics differ significantly from the original prototype. The term ‘catch-all’, for example, has been most frequently subjected to this kind of abuse (see Puhle, 2002), given its de facto status as a residual category that seems to be more flexible and adaptable to contemporary circumstances than the earlier classic party models. Thus, while we acknowledge the many valuable contributions of empirical studies of parties that have been based upon the traditional West European party models, we believe that the study of parties in other world regions, as well as efforts to better capture the dynamics of ‘the new campaign politics’ of recent decades (see Pasquino, 2001), would be greatly enhanced by a reassessment and broadening of these party models.
A second problem with the existing typologies is that, in the aggregate, they have been based on a wide variety of criteria, and little or no effort has been invested in an attempt to make them more consistent and compatible with one another. These inconsistencies, as well as the lack of precision in defining certain types of parties, have hindered the capacity of research in this area to result in cumulative theory-building. Some typologies are based upon functionalist criteria, differentiating among parties on the basis of an organizational raison d’être or some specific goal that they pursue. Sigmund Neumann (1956), for example, distinguishes between ‘parties of individual representation’ (which articulate the demands of specific social groups) and ‘parties of social integration’ (which have well-developed organizations and provide a wide variety of services to members, encapsulating them within a partisan community, in exchange for which they count on financial contri- butions and volunteered services of members during election campaigns). In his typology, ‘parties of total integration’ have more ambitious goals of seizing power and radically transforming societies, demanding the full commitment and unquestioning obedience of members. Herbert Kitschelt (1989) differentiates parties that emphasize the ‘logic of electoral com- petition’ from those (such as the ‘left-libertarian’ type that he introduces) that place much greater stress on the ‘logic of constituency representation’. Wolinetz (2002) distinguishes among ‘vote-seeking’, ‘policy-seeking’ and ‘office-seeking’ parties. And Katz and Mair (1995) implicitly advance a functionalist logic in setting forth the model of the ‘cartel party’, in which public financing of parties and the expanded role of the state induce party leaders to restrain competition and seek primarily to perpetuate themselves in power to avail themselves of these new resources.
Other classification schemes are organizational, distinguishing between parties that have thin organizational structures and those that have devel- oped large infrastructures and complex networks of collaborative relation- ships with other secondary organizations. The classic statement of this kind was by Maurice Duverger, who advanced a two-and-one-half category scheme separating ‘cadre’ parties (most commonly led by individuals with high socio-economic status) from ‘mass’ parties (which mobilize broad segments of the electorate through the development of a large and complex organization), with the ‘devotee’ party alluded to but dismissed as ‘too vague to constitute a separate category’.1 Herbert Kitschelt (1994) posits a four-part classification system distinguishing among ‘centralist clubs’, ‘Leninist cadre’ parties, ‘decentralized clubs’ and ‘decentralized mass’ parties. And Angelo Panebianco (1988), in the most elaborate articulation of an organizational typology, contrasts ‘mass-bureaucratic’ parties with ‘electoral-professional’ parties.
Some scholars of party politics implicitly or explicitly base their work on the notion that parties are the products of (and ought to represent the inter- ests of) various social groups. This sociological orientation characterizes the analyses of parties set forth by Samuel Eldersveld (1964) and Robert Michels (1915), as Panebianco (1988: 3) points out. Finally, there are some prominent scholars who indiscriminately mix all three of these sets of criteria, such as Otto Kirchheimer (1966), who posits four party models: bourgeois parties of individual representation; class-mass parties; denomi- national mass parties; and catch-all people’s parties.
We do not object to the notion that several different criteria may be employed to differentiate one type of party from another. Indeed, as is apparent below, we use three criteria as the basis of our own integrative schema. However, we do believe that systematic hypothesis-testing and cumulative theory-building have been hindered by the tendency of pro- ponents of the various typologies to ‘talk past’ one another without systematically assessing the overlap or distinctiveness, not to mention the relative merits, of the various classification schema.2 This lack of concep- tual and terminological consistency stands in sharp contrast to some other subfields of political science, such as the closely related literature on party systems, within which a clear consensus has emerged concerning the meaning (and even specific operational indicators) of such core concepts as ‘fragmentation’, ‘volatility’ and ‘disproportionality’.
Some (but by no means all) of these typologies, moreover, have been based on the selection of just one criterion as the basis of a typology (be it organiz- ational structure, principal organizational objective or social basis of representation). This has narrowed the focus of analysis excessively, while much variation within each party type is not systematically analysed. What is gained in terms of parsimony is lost in terms of the ability to capture theoretically significant variation among real-world parties. In addition, many of these studies are excessively deductive, positing at the outset that one particular criterion is of paramount importance without sustaining that assertion through a careful assessment of relevant evidence. As a result, some such studies fall victim to reductionist argumentation, in which several structural or behavioural characteristics of parties are assumed to have been caused by one privileged variable. Duverger (1954), for example, sets forth an organization-based typology, but also acknowledges the great import- ance of social class-linking cadre parties with the middle and upper strata, and the working class with mass-based parties. He explains this relationship by contending that these organizational forms are dictated by varying levels of resources and constraints faced by party-builders in their efforts to secure funding necessary to support their activities.
We believe (with Koole, 1996) that it is premature to attempt to build elaborate theories on the basis of what may be inadequate typologies. A more open and ultimately productive line of empirical analysis should begin with a more theoretically modest but empirically more comprehensive and accurate set of party types that are more truly reflective of real-world vari- ations among parties. This is particularly necessary in an effort to include countries outside of Western Europe within a preliminary comparative analysis. Thus, we shall increase the number of party types, building whenever possible on models and terminology previously advanced by other scholars, while at the same time imposing some semblance of order on some of the criteria most commonly used as the basis of party typologies. Specific- ally, we try to avoid the common temptation to introduce a new party type on ad hoc grounds, based simply on a conclusion that a particular case cannot be adequately explained using the existing typologies.
Our typology of parties is based upon three criteria. The first of these involves the nature of the formal organization of the party. Some parties are organizationally thin, while others develop large mass-membership bases with allied or ancillary institutions engaged in distinct but related spheres of social life; some rely on particularistic networks of personal interaction or exchange, while others are open and universalistic in member- ship and appeal; and some rely heavily, if not exclusively, on modern tech- niques of mass communication and ignore the development of primary, face-to-face channels of communication or secondary associations. The second classificatory criterion involves the nature of the party’s program- matic commitments. Accordingly, some parties derive programmatic stands from well-articulated ideologies rooted in political philosophies, religious beliefs or nationalistic sentiments; others are either pragmatic or have no well-defined ideological or programmatic commitments; still others are committed to advance the interests of a particular ethnic, religious or socio- economic group, or geographically defined constituency, in contrast to those that are heterogeneous if not promiscuously eclectic in their electoral appeals to groups in society. The third criterion involves the strategy and behavioural norms of the party, specifically, whether the party is tolerant and pluralistic or proto-hegemonic in its objectives and behavioural style: some parties are fully committed to democratic rules-of-the-game, are tolerant and respectful towards their opponents, and are pluralistic in their views of polity and society; others are semi-loyal to democratic norms and institutions, or are explicitly anti-system, favouring the replacement of the existing pluralistic democracy with a regime that would be more uniformly committed to the achievement of their programmatic objectives.
In our more detailed discussion of parties that are characteristic of each party model, we also deal with two other dimensions of party life that are significant and have been extensively dealt with in the existing literature on parties. One of these is sociological, i.e. the nature of the clientele towards which the party pitches its appeals, and whose interests it purports to defend or advance. The second involves the internal dynamics of party decision- making, particularly the nature and degree of prominence of the party’s leader, ranging from a dominant charismatic figure, at one extreme, to more collective forms of party leadership, at the other. We hypothesize that party types (defined by the organizational, programmatic and strategic criteria listed above) are often associated with particular social clienteles and/or leadership patterns, but not in a deterministic manner, and certainly not to the extent that these sociological and leadership dimensions are built into the definition of the party type.
It is important to note that the models of political parties that we describe below are ideal types, in the strictest Weberian sense of that term. As such, they are heuristically useful insofar as they give easily understandable labels that will help the reader more easily comprehend otherwise complex, multi- dimensional concepts. Moreover, they facilitate analysis insofar as they serve as baselines for comparisons involving real-world cases, or as extreme end- points of evolutionary processes that might never be fully attained. As with all ideal types, however, one should not expect that real-world political parties fully conform to all of the criteria that define each party model; simi- larly, some parties may include elements of more than one ideal type. Perhaps most importantly, individual parties may evolve over time, such that they may have most closely approximated one party type in an earlier period, but shift in the direction of a different type later on."
"as a comparative politics expert, explain this in detail. do it in a discoursive way following the authors train, also it has to be extremely detailed. keep the in-text citations : Parties and electoral systems
As we saw in the previous chapter, in parliamentary systems, the key instrument for linking voters with government is the political party. Parties offer ideologies, images or – less often – specific policy proposals. Voters decide whether or not to vote for them. In presidential systems, parties are sometimes looser constructions, but most presidential systems are also based on party systems. Successful parties either win presidential elections or achieve a majority in the legislature and are therefore in a position to form the government.
Chapter 4: Electoral systems and party systems
    However, the relationship between parties and electoral systems is extremely complex. One reason for this is that there is not necessarily an easy ‘fit’ between party strengths and the sustainability of a particular government. There would be no problem if one party always received an outright majority of the vote, or if two parties captured virtually the whole vote between them. However, when a number of parties divide the vote in varying proportions, then several kinds of difficulties arise. For example, obtaining a definite result with a clear majority; giving each party involved its proper ‘weight’ in proportion to the votes cast, and so on. The next section of this chapter looks at how different electoral systems attempt to solve these problems. Democracy within parties and between parties
One important question about party politics concerns the relationship between intra-party (internal) democracy and competition between parties. Increasingly, it is believed that party members should be able to choose party leaders. This enables ordinary citizens to exert some impact on government via active participation in the political party of their choice.
There are several ways in which internal party democracy can be organised. In Britain, the major parties choose their leaders by a national ballot of the membership. Party leaders do not serve a fixed term, and are expected to resign in the event of a poor electoral performance. A party’s members of parliament can remove a leader but not elect one. In the United States there are primary elections, taking place over several months and organised according to different rules according to the laws of different states. In some Latin American countries there is a primary in which all party members can vote.
Problems with internal party democracy
The goal of internal party democracy has been heavily criticised from at least two different perspectives. One of them is that political parties need some kind of elite direction and guidance if they are to succeed. This is partly because a process which, as far as party members are concerned,
is an exercise in democracy, is likely to resemble disunity and indiscipline to outsiders. There is empirical evidence that voters are less likely to vote for a party if they see it as internally divided. Media scrutiny of parties is likely to bring out and exaggerate party disunity. However, it is possible to mitigate this problem by limiting internal party democracy to set occasions when a formal leadership contest is underway. Internal party elections can then be unifying because it can allow outstanding differences to be settled by majority vote.
There is a more difficult problem, though, which has to do with the fact that party activists may have very different preferences from the general public as a whole. It is clear that party-political activism is generally, and always has been, essentially a minority pursuit in democratic societies. The majority of adult citizens can generally be relied upon to vote in national elections. Even so, local elections in Britain and mid-term congressional elections in the USA do not always persuade even half of the adult population to turn up and vote. However, party membership almost invariably involves a far smaller proportion of the population.
The proportion of active party members is fewer still. It is therefore certain that party political activists are a relatively small minority of
the population. It is also possible that they may be an unrepresentative minority. Political activists tend to have more extreme (or at least more decided) views than most members of society. That is probably why they became party members in the first place. It may therefore be the case that party activists will want leaders committed to policies that ordinary voters may not support. They may also choose leaders that the general public may find unattractive.
Downs’ model
The American political scientist Anthony Downs presented an argument along these lines in theoretical form (Downs, 1997). Let us imagine the electorate of any country, governed by policy preferences that can be identified on a continuum from left-wing to right-wing. If voting was compulsory and there were only two parties, both of whom were primarily interested in winning, then the two parties would position themselves to capture as much of the vote as possible. It can easily be demonstrated that, under those circumstances, the party closest to the centre ground would win. Parties that listened too much to their activists would be likely to move away from the centre ground and therefore risk defeat.
The model was recognised by Downs himself to be very abstract. Most voters do not self-consciously think of themselves as left-wing or right- wing. Many voters have no real understanding of these terms. Moreover, what is thought of as right-wing or left-wing can vary over time. These may be no more than shorthand expressions that are not rigorously grounded. Furthermore, individual voters are not completely independent figures. They may well be subject to persuasion by others who are more ideologically committed. Voting is not generally compulsory and there is a danger that disillusioned activists will either themselves abstain or will at any rate make less effort to persuade ordinary people to vote and thereby damage their own party.
Critics of Downs’ model
Downs’ model has also been criticised by authors who doubt that many voters in any election simply make up their minds on the basis of the issues. An alternative approach has been to see parties as ‘representing’ sectional interests within a society, with Labour or social democratic parties representing the interests of labour and Conservative or Christian Democrat parties representing the interests of the middle classes. A Downsian might reply, however, that elections are decided principally by voters capable of changing their minds. Loyal supporters of political parties, who certainly exist, cannot by definition determine the fluctuating outcomes of actual elections. Furthermore, the tendency in advanced industrial societies
since 1945 has been for sectional cleavages to become less pronounced. There are fewer workers without either some property or the aspiration to achieve social mobility, and parties that reflect only sectional interests are in decline. Parties therefore have to compete for the popular vote if they want to be successful: mere identification with a clan or group is becoming less and less adequate as a means of winning elections.
Despite the criticisms of Downs’ model, there is evidence that ordinary voters in two-party systems will often reject anything which appears to them to smack of extremism. Examples are: the heavy defeats suffered by the Labour Party in Britain in 1983, the Conservative Party in Britain in
2001, the Republican Party in the USA in 1964 and the Democratic Party in the USA in 1972. Parties that become too interested in the concerns of their own activists sometimes lose touch with issues of greatest concern to the ordinary voter. This can be electorally very costly. The cost of political extremism may be less in multiparty systems because of the logic of coalition politics. Even if political extremism may alienate some voters, a small party with a rock-solid but minority base of support (for example,
a religious party) may enjoy considerable pivotal power. Furthermore, in multiparty systems most parties have no realistic prospect of appealing to more than a minority of the electorate, so there is less need to appeal to the centre ground.
Party activists in countries with systems of proportional representation can try to prevent the leaderships from making the necessary bargains to build and maintain coalitions. A good example of what can go wrong happened under the Allende presidency in Chile. Allende was elected president with a minority share of the vote. By compromising on certain principles, he would have had a chance to bring the Christian Democratic Party to his side. This would have given him a congressional and possibly popular majority. However, Socialist Party activists objected to any such coalition being formed and they were able to stop Allende from reaching agreement with the Christian Democrats. The result of this failure to agree was disastrous. Politics became increasingly polarised between a minority that wanted socialism and a majority that did not, and Allende was eventually overthrown by the military.
It should not necessarily be inferred from this that party leaderships are always right and party activists always wrong. The relationship between the two can perhaps be seen in terms of Weber’s distinction between ‘charismatic’ and ‘legal rational’ authority. There has to be a place for beliefs and activism in any democratic system or else the whole system will come to be seen as pointless. Without continuing contact with party activists, party leaderships may be open to capture by the administrative machinery of modern government, or by interest groups outside the formal political system altogether.
The decline of parties?
In recent years, there has been a tendency for party activism to decline in many democracies. The amount of popular enthusiasm for politics has also tended to decline. As a result, parties in some countries have become more like what Duverger (1964) described as ‘cadre parties’. That is to say, they are defined more by their attitude to power than their identification with principles. Those who participate actively in party politics are less likely
to be idealists and more likely to be ambitious individuals who want a career in politics. Meanwhile, activists have either turned their attention to specific interest groups, or to small and ideologically purer parties such as the Greens. In some other countries, such as Italy and some Latin American cases, the result of declining party organisation has meant that politics has become much more personalist and based around support for – or dislike of – prominent individuals. The general cult of media celebrity has reinforced this tendency. Some personalists – such as Hugo Chavez in Venezuela – are highly ideological, while others represent chiefly themselves.
The danger of this decline in party loyalty is that parties themselves can become vulnerable to challenges from outside politics. For example, Chavez was a military officer who had led an unsuccessful coup in 1992 before his election to the presidency in 1998, and Berlusconi was a media
Chapter 4: Electoral systems and party systems
  magnate. Both were very much outsider figures. People who are attached to a party (or other organisation) because they genuinely believe in it, are likely to remain when times are hard. Those who are mainly motivated by self-interest are likely to defect more quickly. People who can see that a party is no longer motivated seriously by its own professed principles are also likely to desert in large numbers when they become discontented. In recent years, the Italian electorate has voted heavily to reject the old party system. On the Right, the old Christian Democratic Party has been replaced by a combination of new parties (notably Berlusconi’s Forza Italia) and former extremist parties, such as the Northern League and the Fascists. In Canada an established Conservative Party was largely replaced in the 1994 election by the new Reform Party, which offers a more populist version of conservatism. In the USA in 1992, Ross Perot achieved the highest share
of the vote received by a third party candidate since the 1920s. In France Jean Marie le Pen reached the second round in the presidential elections of 2002.

List the main ‘third party’ movements in majoritarian democracies in recent years.
Compare and contrast what happened to them. Political parties in new democracies
There has been a considerable spread of democratisation since around 1980. There is no simple model dealing with the role of political parties in new democracies that fits all cases, but there have been some interesting developments, and we will consider three. They all involve interesting variants on what was regarded before 1980 as ‘normal’ patterns of democratic politics.
From authoritarianism to democracy
One has been the successful transformation of parties that were once dominant in an authoritarian system to being competitive parties in a democratic system. The Mexican Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI) won elections (for governorships, senate seats and the presidency) with such regularity that for many years Mexico could not really be regarded as a democracy at all. However, in 2000 the PRI lost a presidential election and went into opposition. Despite this setback, it has been able to maintain itself as a considerable force in Mexican politics. The same
is largely true of the former dominant party in Taiwan, the Kuomintang (KMT). Former communist parties in eastern Europe, following varying degrees of internal reform, continue to exist and sometimes win elections. Where previous authoritarian governments had some popular support, but not enough to win national elections, then formerly dominant parties have helped to act as a bridge between authoritarianism and democracy by allowing supporters of the former authoritarian regime to continue to play a role in the political system.
Collapse of political parties
Secondly, there have been some circumstances in which political parties have collapsed altogether. Peru and Venezuela during the 1990s both
saw the complete collapse of party systems that had been fairly well established. It has sometimes happened that the formerly collapsed parties have reconstituted themselves and returned to power. This happened in Peru when Alan Garcia of the APRA party was elected to the presidency for the second time in 2006, although the Peruvian party system as such
  60
remains generally weak. Party collapse is more likely in a presidential than in a parliamentary system, partly because presidentialisms can survive virtually without political parties and parliamentarianisms and partly because there is not usually a formal role for opposition parties in presidential systems where the incumbent president commands a majority. In some countries too, the increased penetration of the political system by big money and the media has tended to weaken the link between voters and parties. This has made it feasible for entirely new kinds of political organisation to enter the scene, as happened with Berlusconi’s Forza Italia.
Clientele parties
Thirdly, there are parties used by powerful families or other interests seeking to manufacture a set of supporters, via clientelism or media appeals, in order to secure access to the patronage resources of the state. These parties are the means of gaining and distributing selective incentives to encourage loyalty. Such parties are generally anti-ideological. They tend to be more common in countries with a significant rural component for example, some countries in Latin America. Clientele parties are harder to maintain in urban areas, although it is not impossible to do this. Clientelism works best when both the bureaucratic ethic of the state and the rule of law are relatively weak. These issues are discussed in later chapters."

"what is the correlation between this and Kant: Danewid, I. (2023). Resisting racial capitalism: An Antipolitical Theory of Refusal
Main argument: “the state is not a neutral arbiter of justice that can or should be appealed to for rights, recognition, or restitution. Rather, the state is a relation of violence that is central to upholding and entrenching racial capitalism across the world. This is a type of violence
that cannot be reformed away through a politics that merely strives to make oppressive
institutions more diverse, inclusive, or tolerant. As a permanent war waged on those
deemed delinquent, wayward, and undeserving, the state must itself be abolished. [...] Put
simply, if state violence is central to racial capitalism, then the state cannot be the horizon
of freedom” → the state itself should be abolished: it’s the state itself that is violet and is upholding racial capitalism, you can’t seek the solution within the state

Chapter 1: Development of State Power and Racial Capitalism→  the state emerged as a colonial project. “Ida Danewid argues that state power is central to racial capitalism’s violent regimes of extraction and accumulation” -- develops a novel theory of state power rooted in an analysis of racial capitalism
 
Chapter 3-6: Techniques of State Violence. Explores four technologies of state violence (policing, bordering, wastelanding, reproductive control) → why the state is problematic 
 
Chapter 2: Solution to end Governance (move beyond the state): The Antipolitical  = ""to end governance
excavates a global antipolitical tradition that refuses to reduce freedom to a question of
how we shall be governed""

3 main concepts: state, race and capitalism, which are connected. 2 main issues: the state itself as a form of governance and racial capitalism 
RACIAL CAPITALISM “From the start, state and capital existed in symbiosis, with race as their lifeblood” → state and capital function on the basis of race. How are they linked? 

Capitalism requires (racial) violence → 
There was this idea that capitalism is based on the principle of free-hand non intervention, instead Danewid says that the functioning of capitalism has always relied on intervention and oppression [marxist thought: capitalism relies on stealing from the working class which is done through violence], violence that is justified through racial and colonial hierarchies.
""The history of capitalism as a story (...) of the enslavement, dispossession, expropriation,
and coercion of the ‘dark proletariat’ on a global-colonial scale.""
""the relationship between racial violence and capital accumulation (...) focus on capitalism as a racialised and global-colonial system predicated on distinct yet interconnected forms of extraction, exploitation, and expropriation""
“From the start, state and capital existed in symbiosis, with race as their lifeblood”
→ racial and colonial violence as a permanent feature of capital accumulation which then requires state violence for coercion

→ Racial capitalism requires the state →
Coercion, domination, and oppression require the state’s violent instruments (e.g. the police and prisons). The instruments to uphold violence are delivered by the state: the state delivers the violence 

→ ""The state is here revealed as an assemblage of carceral, administrative, legal, and
extractive systems which are aimed at (re)producing a bourgeois order grounded in racial-
colonial hierarchy, stratification, and domination.”
“The state emerged as part of a racial capitalist conception of politics centred around the
antidemocratic and hierarchical question of how to be governed. Then as well as now,
state violence has been central to producing the disposability and extractability that
capital requires to profit and thrive”

→ The state and racial capitalism therefore go hand in hand
“the state is itself racialising, gendering, and hierarchy- producing; it creates, maintains, and polices the hierarchies and stratifications that capital needs to successfully exploit, extract, and expropriate [in order to make profit].”

DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATE: Danewid gives a clear overview of how the state emerged
The state developed as a violent racial-colonial project (both internally and externally) in response to revolutionary struggles in medieval Europe
A crisis of revolutionary struggles: Socialist anti-feudal uprisings in late medieval period causing a breakdown of authority (feudal system caused a lot of frustration, peasants demanded that property would be abolished → feudal order was at risk of breakdown, so the elites came up with the capitalist state) 
""European state formation was from the beginning a violent process of conquering and
colonising racialised groups within Europe itself…. Racism and colonialism are here revealed as structural features of the state already within Europe, before they were later extended to the rest of the world after 1492.""
Violent counter-revolution from above: Centralised capitalist state to suppress lower classes
→ race became a tool of oppression [elites/white vs revolters/racialised) (“While the rise of the capitalist state went hand-in-hand with the making of racialized others who could be exploited, enslaved, persecuted, and dominated, it also saw the emergence of whiteness as the integral element of European ruling-class identity”) 
Racial terror campaigns: The making of racialized others in order to suppress
Externalisation: The racism and colonialism that was already taking place within Europe (due to state formation) was extended globally after 1492 (when america was “discovered”, racialisation became popular on a global scale)

Socialist anti-feudal uprisings in late medieval period → crisis of European feudal order –
breakdown of authority (also due to other factors) → violent counterrevolution from
above: centralised capitalist state to suppress lower classes
Racial terror-campaigns (land enclosures, witch-hunts, executions, and incarceration of
vagrants in workhouses) articulated through racial logic → elites (‘white christians’) where
of different ethnicity than proletariat/revolters → racialisation (cultural hierarchies
transformed into racial differences) of jews, muslims, irish, romani, traveller communities,
slavs → structural racial repression, state surveillance, land expropriation, and expulsion

→ “As a counterrevolution, state formation was from the start a racial-colonial project entailing both internal centralisation and domination as well as external conquest and enslavement.
This went hand in hand with the making of racialized others who could be enslaved, exploited, and expropriated, as well as with the emergence of whiteness as the integral element of European ruling-class identity. The state has therefore always been a racial state.”

WESTERN POLITICAL THOUGHT: science/philosophy is always biased. 
The birth of the state “also saw the birth of the political paradigm: an antidemocratic and
hierarchical vision of society centred around the question of how to be governed.” they take state authority for granted --> she calls them “proto-fascist” [they don’t question the idea and the necessity of the state]
“Western political theory has come to associate politics with rulership, sovereignty, hierarchy
and, ultimately, the state.”

The solution: The Antipolitical (source Cedric Robinson!!)
“If state violence is a constituent element of racial capitalism, then justice cannot be limited to making claims on the state, whether through appeals to rights, law, or recognition. Rather, the state is itself something to be resisted and struggled against. This might, of course, sound naïve and utopian. After all, the hegemony of the political paradigm has made it virtually impossible to conceive of freedom and sociality outside the state.”

The political = the state = racial capitalism = antidemocratic and hierarchical = bad
The antipolitical = the real solution, unlike the Left/Right spectrum and Western political thought suggests
→ Utopia = ending governance 
Unlike current state hegemony suggests, you can’t change anything by making appeals (e.g. reform) to the state → mistake of the Left and western political thought → ‘the political’ is tied to the state which is tied to racial capitalism → need for anti political



ROBINSON (1983) - RACIAL CAPITALISM 
Racial capitalism sees capitalism dependent on racial inequality and race integrally tied to the capital system. Cedric Robinson's concept of racial capitalism, as articulated in Black Marxism (1983), argues that capitalism as an economic and social system has always been intertwined with racial inequality. Robinson expands the term, initially used by South African activists to describe apartheid's exploitative system, into a broader historical analysis. 

Racialism permeates capitalism as a material force. The organization, development, and expansion of capitalist society have consistently relied on racial hierarchies to extract labor, accumulate wealth, and maintain power structures. (Robinson, 1983) 

He argues that the world system of racial capitalism is one that always depended on slavery, violence and genocide. For Robinson, racial capitalism isn't limited to economic exploitation; it also encompasses the cultural, social, and political dimensions of race, shaping the totality of modern capitalist society.
Draws his idea from Marxist theory, however he’s very critical of him: 
Argues that at base, marxism is a western construction, it is based on the experience of european peoples, civilisation, social order and cultures
Rather than being a universal philosophical method, he argues that its origins, analytical presumption, historical perspectives are western
Assumption and presumption that this ideas can be used to explain cases and examples far beyond the western experience
Marx did not account for the racial aspect of capitalism

Critique of the REVOLUTIONARY SUBJECT: 
Marx saw the European proletariat as the revolutionary class, the motor-force of history.
Fanon says the peasantry and urban lumpen in decolonising countries were the main revolutionary force
Robinson says that when we look at the world-scale of capitalism, we have a more complex capitalist world system than the European model that was the basis for marxist analysis. And when we look at it we see that there are other revolutionary forces that marxist ignored: the black radical tradition both in african diaspora and continent itself → his work is very important to the rise of black movement today, this idea holds truth today

Question of FEUDALISM AND CAPITALISM: 
Robinson critiques traditional Marxist frameworks for failing to adequately address the role of race in the formation and perpetuation of capitalist systems. He argues that European feudalism already contained racialized systems of oppression, which capitalism absorbed and adapted rather than creating anew.
For Robinson capitalism wasn’t a negation of feudalism in the way Marx described it, but rather an extension of existing social/feudal relations into modern global political and economic relations. 
Marx had quite a cut and dry view of feudalism making space for a capitalist society, one superseding the other is a “staged approach” → Robisnon doesn’t see them as antagonistic to one another, rather he sees capitalism as growing out from feudalism 
From its very beginnings, european civilisation was constructed on antagonistic differences → in contrast to the homogeneous european society described by marx, where class is the only difference separating people into classes, Robinson argues that right from the start there were also racial differences: the first european proletariats such as the irish, the jews, were racial subjects
As capitalism becomes established, european civilisation begins to shape these regional subcultural dialectical differences into racial differences 

Robinson is concerned with the role of slavery: 
Marx has been concerned with slavery as a key engine of primitive accumulation (the original ways in which massive amounts of dispossession and exploitation provide the basis for the foundations of capitalism). Marx argues that African workers were turned into property and African labor power as slave labor had been integrated into 19th century manufacturing and industrial capitalism. Slave labor was for Marx at the base of industrial capitalism and it sustained the world market beyond europe 
Between 15th-19th cent. 15/20 million African people were brought to the new world
When marx talked about the development of the productive forces in england and europe, he does not take into account that the capital accumulation for the industrial revolution as well as the establishment of stable industries in north America were dependent on slavery and post-slavery (ongoing exploitation of black workers).  
→ results: death and degradation of African people, degradation of social institutions and underdevelopment of Africa’s economy."
"as a democracy & democratisation expert, explain this in detail. do it in a discoursive way following the authors train, also it has to be extremely detailed. keep the in-text citations : Modernisation theory and its critics
If we look around, we see that most wealthy countries in the world are liberal democracies. We also see a historical trend according to which countries that are now democracies tended to democratise as they became richer, although this does not at all suggest that they became democratic at the same pace or without struggle and conflict. Nor, as just noted,
does it imply that poor countries cannot be democracies; in fact, many poor countries are democracies. Nor can we be certain that democracy
is necessarily the wave of the future. The future is, by definition, unpredictable. There is little doubt, however, that, for most of the past hundred years, a definite relation could be established between affluence and democracy. The question is not so much whether but why this is true.
Economic development and democracy
The question of whether economic development leads to democracy was first raised in the USA. At the end of the Second World War, the European empires were in decline and Soviet communism was seen by many as
an alternative to European colonialism. The US government, in contrast, became identified with a different position. It believed that independent countries would gradually increase their national wealth. This, in turn, would lead to social change, which in turn would ultimately bring about both democracy and development.
This line of analysis has frequently been criticised as too optimistic and evolutionary. It does rather de-emphasise the importance of political culture and the historical specificity of each country. If we allow for the fact that we are dealing with a relatively simple explanation that does not seek to cover everything, modernisation theory does have advantages. What helps it is a further phenomenon that has proved broadly true
up until now – that the world’s most affluent societies typically suffer from less internal inequality and a greater diffusion of economic
power than poorer societies. This enables a happy coincidence of view between authors who put most emphasis on limited internal inequality
as a key condition of democracy – the case with Vanhanen (1997) and Rueschemeyer (1992) – and those who regard affluence itself as the most important factor. It also helps that First World countries have, for the most part, experienced fairly constant improvements in living standards since around 1950. The ability of societies to enjoy the benefit of steady increases in real income may also be a factor making for democratic stability. People become relatively contented with their life chances and are less likely to resort to anti-democratic means in order to change them.
Finally, the years since 1945 have seen an absence of major war, although there have, of course, been conflicts in various parts of the world. We cannot know for certain what effect nuclear warfare would have upon democratic stability, but it is likely that it would be powerfully negative.
Literacy
Sometimes, as in the case of Lipset’s work (1959; 1983), various kinds of argument are run together. One of these has to do with the role of literacy in democracy. The key point is that, once societies reach a certain size and sophistication, the written word becomes crucial in the communication of information. The outdoor assembly may have been feasible in a small city- state, but could not serve much of a purpose once a country’s population reached tens of millions. Much political argument takes place through
the written word – in pre-televisual days, almost all of it did. How could a voter be expected to assess a complex economic argument if he or she could not read?
This theory is appealing, but the relation between literacy and development is not perfect. India is a good example of a country that has remained democratic since independence despite the existence of significant illiteracy. Better evidence shows that the relation works in the opposite direction. High levels of literacy and a good educational system are regarded as crucial if countries are able to move from poverty to relative affluence. At the same time, wealthier societies can more easily spare the resources necessary to operate ambitious public education systems. Even today, evidence from some poor countries shows that very poor people are not much interested in education because they need their children to bring in an income – however small – from a very early age.
Urbanisation
Another factor that has been regarded as important for the development of democratic systems is urbanisation. From the beginning of time until the nineteenth century, most of the world’s population was rural. Britain was the first country to urbanise extensively. Although the British Industrial Revolution dates from the beginning of the nineteenth century, the rate
of social change increased radically from the development of the railways in the 1830s and 1840s. It was only in the later part of the nineteenth century that the majority of the British population was urban based. By the same token, urbanisation took place even later in the main countries of Europe and in the USA. Most present-day first world societies only acquired urban majorities in the early part of the twentieth century.
Since around 1800, an increasing proportion of the world’s population
is to be found in urban areas. The pattern of urbanisation has spread
from First World countries to parts of the world that are still considered relatively less developed. Latin America had a rural majority in the 1950s and reached the 50 per cent urbanisation rate some time during the 1960s. It is now heavily urbanised. Urbanisation is now taking place across Africa and Asia, including – at a very fast rate – China.
Why should cities be associated with democracy? Modernisation theorists have argued that the urban voter is less deferential than the rural one. It is certainly true that established churches, where they are strong, tend to find greater followings in rural than in urban areas. By the same token, socialist and communist parties have almost always performed better in urban than in rural areas.
It has been argued that urban voters communicate more with people like each other and less with people in different class situations. It is possible that the anonymity of urban life can allow somewhat greater personal independence, which might in turn encourage greater political activism. Moreover, the greater possibilities for socialisation in urban areas might allow the urban poor to appreciate the distinctiveness of their situation rather than defining their interests in terms of a dominant value system. Urban mobs are less likely to be deferential and more likely to be radical. Well-attested historical examples certainly point to cases in which established power was challenged in the cities, but found support in the countryside.
It would be a mistake, however, to regard country dwellers everywhere as naturally conservative. Moore (1967), discussed later in this chapter, calls some of these assumptions into question. Where there have been major social upheavals – for example, the French and Russian revolutions – rural rebellion was an important part of the process. It might be more accurate to say that country dwellers are not natural social democrats in the way that the urban working class was once reputed to be. Country dwellers might organise their political lives around particular collective demands
– for example, for the redistribution of land or for a particular form of national self-determination – that simply do not easily fit into the world’s views of urban social democrats. Diffusion of power
A broader version of modernisation theory – one that features in the work of Vanhanen – suggests that democracy is associated with the diffusion
of power. Modernisation theorists generally believe that the process of economic development would itself tend to diffuse power within a society and therefore undermine the position of ‘traditional’ elites. As society became more sophisticated, the distribution of power would become broader, even without political change. Under these circumstances, a traditional elite would find that it no longer held all the levers of power within its own society. Control over resources, particularly financial resources, would be extended to a wider section of the population, with the result being that the middle classes and others would be better able to assert their right to political representation through democratic means.
It is certainly true that there are European cases in which the power of money was used to ensure that monarchical or aristocratic rulers became more accountable to the people. When the Duke of Wellington tried to maintain the old semi-monarchical political system in the early 1830s against demands for reform, some of his opponents tried to organise a
run on the banks. ‘To stop the Duke, go for gold’ was the slogan. This version of modernisation theory is rather bland, however. Political power is generally transferred significantly, when it is so transferred, through active contestation rather than through the slow diffusion of power via the increased complexity of society – although diffusion may change the odds attached to the outcome of particular conflicts.
Criticisms of modernisation theory Economic criticisms
Left-wing and right-wing critics challenged some of the main premises of modernisation theory during the 1960s and 1970s. On the Left, doubts were expressed as to whether modernisation was actually occurring in many parts of the world. In Latin America, where these doubts were elaborated in their most sophisticated form, so-called dependency theory suggested that the developing countries would be unable to catch up with First World countries, because they lacked sufficient economic power. Ironically, these doubts were being expressed at a time when many parts
of the developing world – Latin America and East Asia in particular – were doing fairly well. By the early 1980s, it appeared as though dependency theory could be dismissed as empirically false. Yet the data, which had seemed at one stage to refute dependency theory, has more recently shown how difficult it is for poor countries to catch up economically with rich countries. Although a number of Asian economies have enjoyed a positive economic performance during the 1980s and 1990s, this was not generally true of Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, eastern Europe or the former Soviet Union. With only a small number of exceptions, the world is now very clearly divided into a number of quite rich countries and a larger number of quite poor countries.
It is likely that many people in poor countries find the slowness of any improvement in their material conditions frustrating. Between 1995 and 2001, survey evidence from Latin America showed a considerable increase in disenchantment with democracy. This correlates with - and may well
be explained by - the experience of significant economic setbacks. While traditional dependency theory was too pessimistic about the economic prospects of poor countries, modernisation theory may well have been too optimistic.
Social criticisms
Critics of modernisation theory are also sceptical as to whether the ‘modernisation’ experience of First World countries could be replicated in socio-economic terms in a different world order. A hundred years ago, the mark of a country experiencing successful socio-economic development was the existence of a large working class made up of manual labourers. This was a powerful social force that acted mainly in favour of social democracy. Today, First World countries no longer have a large traditional working class – poor people certainly are present, but the link established by early twentieth-century sociology between mass production, proletarianisation, poverty and potential economic power can no longer be made (Rueschemeyer, 1992). In most advanced economies, only around one-quarter of the workforce is engaged in manufacturing, and some of this is actually quite well paid. Similarly, in developing countries, typically only a minority of the workforce is engaged in manufacturing production, although there are exceptions.
International criticisms
Democratisation also clearly relates to international factors. It is clearly the case that some countries, by virtue of their geographical position, are heavily dependent upon more powerful neighbours. This may make it difficult for them to adopt autonomous political strategies unwelcome to them. For example, the countries of eastern Europe between 1945 and the late 1980s had little choice but to adopt some form of communism because of the will of the then Soviet Union. Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968 were actually invaded because the then Soviet Union feared that they were about to abandon communism. The USA, which prior to around 1977 often supported non-democratic regimes, subsequently changed its foreign policy to support democracy. This certainly had a major impact on the subsequent democratisation of most of Central and South America.
Demographic criticisms
Historically speaking, it can be observed that a number of countries underwent unsuccessful experiments in democracy before democratic government was finally installed. In many cases, democratic breakdown occurred well after the serious beginnings of economic development. Democracy failed (temporarily) in Germany, Spain and Argentina in the 1930s and in Portugal and Italy during the 1920s. Of all the developed democracies, only a very few (the USA, Britain and some British Commonwealth countries, and Switzerland) have a record unbroken by some form of crisis or democratic breakdown, and the USA had its own civil war between 1861 and 1865.
It is almost a truism within conservative social thought that social transformation can be stressful. It has been suggested that these stresses were themselves likely to make it very difficult to establish democratic institutions. It is also true that a tradition in European sociological thought, associated particularly with Emile Durkheim, related rapid social change to social breakdown (although Durkheim was not primarily a political theorist as such).
The role of population growth plays an important part in the argument. A quick look at the demographics of development might help here. Poor and traditional societies have high birth rates and high death rates.
Chapter 4: General theories of democratisation Because infant and child mortality is very high, parents tend to have many children, in the hope that some will survive to support them in their old age. There is little education, so the cost of raising children is relatively low: they are expected to start some form of work at the age of six or seven. When serious development begins, however, the level of infant and child mortality is likely to fall sharply. These factors are very responsive to changes in the level of income.
The parental generation will not immediately change its reproductive behaviour, even though the rate of child mortality is falling. Thus, the birth rate remains high, even though the death rate may be decreasing and life expectancy rising. As a result, a predominantly young population comes into being. It will not be long before the younger generation itself reaches the age of parenthood, and a disproportionately high young population then reinforces itself by producing further children.
A rapidly growing population is socially disruptive, increasing the pressure on relatively fixed amounts of land. Population growth, therefore,
adds to conflict over land tenure, and a disaffected peasantry can be a powerful catalyst to radical social change. Another consequence of a rising population is likely to be an accelerated drift to the cities. Conservative social theorists have sometimes seen the city as a source of political alienation and disaffection. What they see as the ‘natural’ or ‘organic’ ties of rural life are replaced by a kind of rootlessness, which may lead lonely or socially dissatisfied people to drift into politically extremist movements out of a desire to find solidarity and comradeship. The existence of extremist movements with popular appeal has been seen as one of the factors behind the breakdown of political institutions.
A further consequence of a growing population, and rising living standards, occurs higher up the social scale. As development occurs and the size of the middle classes increases, so competition for university places becomes more intense. Sometimes, universities respond by adopting a conservative policy on admissions; at other times, under political pressure, they expand in order to take in more students. This expansion
is not necessarily accompanied by better teaching or more money for facilities. The result is that students often fail to graduate or find that
they have little to offer a potential employer upon graduation. This leads to discontent, and radical political forces have often been able to recruit extensively from the student/bohemian sub-culture of young people who may be unable to break into the fully middle-class world. A very good recent example of such a political force is Peru’s communist Sendero Luminoso, which was very active in the 1980s and early 1990s.
The arguments evaluated
The non-economic critics of modernisation theory do identify some potential opponents of democracy (such as Rueschemeyer, 1992).
Studies of anti-democratic political movements often find that they are disproportionately supported by people drawn from three different groups:
1. Some traditional families who find it difficult to accept the demand for greater social and civic equality coming from democracy.
2. Potentially ambitious people who find that they do not fit easily into any particular social role. Rapid change may be a factor here.
3. Aggrieved peasants threatened by conflicts over land tenure. The Zapatista rising in Mexico in 1994 would be a good example of this kind of problem."

reactions against the fact of colonial dominance? Is the idea of the 'nation' germane to the cultural topography of the third world, or is anti-colonial nationalism a foreign and 'derivative' discourse? And, finally, is it possible to reconcile the often- aggressive particularism of Asian and African nation-States with the late twentieth century dream of internationalism and globalisation?
Good and bad nationalisms
As we have seen, the encounter
with feminism urges postcolonialism to produce a more critical and self-reflexive account of cultural nationalism. In this chap- ter, we will consider some grounds for a postcolonial defence of the anti-colonial nation. It is generally acknowledged-even by the most cosmopolitan' postcolonial critics—that nation- alism has been an important feature of decolonisation struggles in the third world. Thus, for all his reservations about cultural particularism, Said concedes that:
Along with armed resistance in places as diverse as nineteenth- century Algeria, Ireland and Indonesia, there also went considerable efforts in cultural resistance almost everywhere, the assertions of nationalist identities, and, in the political realm, the creation of associations and parties whose common goal was self-determination and national independence (Said 1993, p. xii).
Accordingly, postcolonial critics recognise that any ade- quate account of the colonial encounter requires a theoretical and historical engagement with the issue of Asian and African nationalisms. And in this regard, a number of questions present themselves: are these insurgent nationalisms purely or simply

In seeking to negotiate the complex implications arising from 'the nationalism question', postcolonial studies is forced to make an intervention into a vexed discourse. So while Benedict Anderson famously argues that 'nation-ness is the most uni- versally legitimate value in the political life of our times' (Anderson 1991, p. 3), at the same time, and paradoxically, competing or 'separatist' appeals for nationhood are generally regarded as symptoms of political illegitimacy. It would appear, then, that while some nations are 'good' and progressive, others are 'bad' and reactionary. In his illuminating essay, 'Nationalisms against the State', David Lloyd attributes the persistence of this chronic distinction between 'good' and 'bad', or 'legitimate' and 'illegitimate', nationalisms to a deeper contradiction that has always occupied the troubled heart of the discourses surrounding nationalism (Lloyd 1993a). The selective and current bias of Western anti-nationalism, he maintains, emerges out of a historically deep-seated metropol- itan antipathy toward anti-colonial movements in the third world. Thus-in response to the threat of decolonisation move- ments-liberalism has been unable to adjudicate between, on the one hand, the world historical claims of Western nation- alism, and, on the other, the specifically anti-Western and oppositional development of cultural nationalism in the 'third world'. Western anti-nationalism, Lloyd suggests, has a history in imperialist thought which postcolonialism cannot afford to ignore. What, then, are the conditions under which nationalism
103
POSTCOLONIAL THEORY
has obtained the theoretical endorsement, and hostility, of Western scholars and critics?
For many theorists, the unquestionable legitimacy of nationalism accrues from its labour on behalf of modernity. Writers like Ernst Gellner and Benedict Anderson, in particular, defend nationalism as the only form of political organisation which is appropriate to the social and intellectual condition of the modern world. Gellner attributes the emergence of nation- alism to the epochal 'shift' from pre-industrial to industrial economies, and argues that, as forms of social organisation become more complex and intricate they come to require a more homogenous and cooperative workforce and polity. Thus, industrial society produces the economic conditions for national consciousness-which it consolidates politically through the supervisory agency of the nation-State. In Gellner's
words:
mobility, communication, size due to refinement of specialisation-imposed by the industrial order by its thirst for affluence and growth, obliges its social units to be large and yet culturally homogenous. The maintenance of this kind of inescapable high (because literate) culture requires protec- tion from a state . . . (Gellner 1983, p. 141).
In a similar vein, Anderson argues that the birth of nation- alism in Western Europe is coeval with the dwindling-if not the death of religious modes of thought. The rationalist secularism of the Enlightenment brings with it the devastation of old systems of belief and sociality embedded in the chimeral mysteries of divine kingship, religious community, sacred lan- guages and cosmological consciousness. Nationalism, Anderson tells us, fills up the existential void left in the wake of paradise: 'What was then required was a secular transfor- mation of fatality into continuity, contingency into meaning
few things were (are) better suited to this end than an idea of the nation' (Anderson 1991, p. 11). The nation, then, is the product of a radically secular and modern imagination, invoked through the cultural forms of the novel and newspaper 104
IMAGINING COMMUNITY
in the godless expanse of what Anderson calls 'homogenous empty time'.
Gellner's and Anderson's accounts of the teleological neces- sity-indeed, inevitability-of the modern nation-State reveal a Hegelian bias. As is well known, Hegel posits the story of 'mankind' as the story of our progression from the darkness of nature into the light of 'History'. The prose of 'History', in turn, delivers the narrative of modernity. 'History' is the vehicle of rational self-consciousness through which the incomplete human spirit progressively acquires an improved sense of its own totality. In other words, 'History' generates the rational process through which the alienated essence of the individual citizen acquires a cohesive and reparative identity in the common life of the nation. Thus, for Hegel, the overlapping narratives of 'Reason', 'Modernity' and 'History' reveal their proper 'end'-the final truth of their significance-in the con- solidated form of the nation-State (see Hegel 1975).
Hegel's monumental and influential defence of civil society furnishes the ideology of nation-ness and, concomitantly, points to the process through which the nation-State has been rendered as the most canonical form of political organisation and identity in the contemporary world. In these post-Hegelian times, 'productive' international conversations and transactions can only be conducted between nations and their real or potential representatives. So, also, individual subjectivity is most readily and conveniently spoken through the idiom of citizenship. And yet to return to an earlier point in this discussion-despite general assumptions about the universal desirability of nation-ness, how is it that liberal thinkers remain hostile to the growing cacophony of national desires in some parts of Asia, Africa, and Central and Eastern Europe? Why is it so widely acknowledged that these 'new' nationalisms are retrogressive, narcissistic, transgressive, uncontainable?
In answer to some of these questions, Lloyd directs atten- tion to a fundamental ambivalence which marks even the most enthusiastic (Western) celebrations of 'progressive' nationalism. In the same works which highlight its irreducible modernity, nationalism is also, and paradoxically, postulated as the
105
POSTCOLONIAL THEORY
catalyst for 'pre-modern' or 'atavistic' sentiments (Lloyd 1993a). While it is acknowledged that the historical momen- tum toward the nation-State fulfils the Hegelian expectation of a successively expansive and rational civil society, writers such as Gellner and Anderson concede that the poetics of 'national belonging' are often underscored by 'irrational', 'superstitious' and 'folkloric' beliefs or practices. How else can we explain the alacrity with which citizens are willing both to kill and to die for their nations?
Tom Nairn's work offers an instructive response to the self-doubt which troubles most liberal engagements with nationalist discourse. It is Nairn's contention that the genetic code of all nationalisms is simultaneously inscribed by the contradictory signals of what he calls 'health' and 'morbidity': 'forms of ""irrationality"" (prejudice, sentimentality, collective egoism, aggression etc.) stain the lot of them' (Nairn 1977, pp. 347-8). If the rhetoric of national development secures a forward-looking vision, the corresponding-and equally pow- erful-rhetoric of national attachment invokes the latent energies of custom and tradition. Thus, nationalism, figured like the two-faced Roman god Janus, or like Walter Benjamin's 'Angel of History', is riven by the paradox that it encourages societies to:
propel themselves forward to a certain sort of goal (industrialisation, prosperity, equality with other peoples etc.) by a certain sort of regression-by looking inwards, drawing more deeply upon their indigenous resources, resurrecting past folk-heroes and myths about themselves and so on (Nairn 1977, p. 348).
Notably, however, rather than simply condemning the atavistic underpinnings of nationalism, Nairn reads the nostalgic yearn- ings of nationhood as compensatory-as an attempt to mitigate the onerous burden of 'progress': 'Thus does nation- alism stand over the passage to modernity, for human society. As human kind is forced through its strait doorway, it must look desperately back into the past, to gather strength
106
IMAGINING COMMUNITY
wherever it can be found for the ordeal of development' (1977, p. 348-9).
Nairn's analysis offers a vital understanding of nationalism's structural vulnerability-of its intrinsically unstable, self- deconstructing discourse. While embodying the idea of universal progress and modernity characteristic of the European Enlightenment, nationalism-it would appear—also incorporates the conditions for an internal critique of its own foundational modernity. It is thus both 'good' and 'bad', both normalising and rebellious:
... the substance of nationalism as such is always morally, politically, humanly ambiguous. This is why moralising per- spectives on the phenomenon always fail, whether they praise or berate it. They will simply seize on one face or another of the creature, and will not admit there is a common head conjoining them (1977, p. 348).
Of course, as Nairn recognises, the ideology of modernity is unlikely to concede the dangerous hybridity of its favourite child. And it is at this point in his argument that we can begin to formulate a postcolonial understanding of the impulse underpinning Western anti-nationalism. In the light of Nairn's analysis, could we, for instance, diagnose metropolitan anti- nationalism as an attempt to purge European nationalism of its own atavism, and in so doing, to project 'regressive' nationalisms elsewhere? Indeed, much Western anti-national- ism is informed by the assumption that the progressive history of the nation swerves dangerously off course in its anti-colonial manifestation, and that relatedly cultural nationalism tragically distorts the foundational modernity of nation-ness. Eric Hobsbawm's reflections on contemporary nationalisms argue just such a case:
the characteristic nationalist movements of the late twen- tieth century are essentially negative, or rather divisive . . . [They are mostly] rejections of modern modes of political organisation, both national and supranational. Time and again they seem to be reactions of weakness and fear, attempts to
107

characteristically universalise themselves, 'they regard any insurgency against them as necessarily provincial' (Deane 1990, p. 9). While anti-colonial insurgency may very often, as Said points out, seek its deliverance in a defiant provincialism, it is equally true that the charge of 'nativism' is all too readily invoked to pronounce the illegitimacy of insurgency. Nativism or atavism constitute, as we have seen, the indispensable and convenient Other to the arrogant discourse of modernity. This deceptively neat opposition between positive or modern and negative or non-modern nationalisms renders all local, plural and recalcitrant varieties of nationalism as inevitably inade- quate and subordinate. Lloyd's comments on Irish national movements are, once again, startlingly apposite:
In the writings of nationalism we can observe, as it were, the anxieties of canon formation, since negation largely takes place through the judgement that a given cultural form is either too marginal to be representative or, in terms that recapitulate those of imperialism itself, a primitive manifes- tation in need of development or cultivation (Lloyd 1993b, p. 5).
Furthermore, it is important to recognise that forms of nationalism which refuse the singular content of modernity are not necessarily all designed to turn human beings against each other. Mercifully there is still a world of difference between Yeats' occultism and the Taliban militia's fanatical edict against female literacy in wartorn Afghanistan. And modernity itself, far from being simply a benefit, can also be read, as Nairn reasons, as an 'ordeal', which demands the palliative energies of so-called 'atavistic' enterprises.
Midnight's children: the politics of nationhood
From another perspective, the postcolonial attachment to nationalism is informed by the historical apprehension that the condition of Asian and African 'postcoloniality' has been mediated and accomplished through the discourses and struc- tures of nation-ness. Thus, the project of becoming 110
IMAGINING COMMUNITY
postcolonial-of arriving into a decisive moment after colo- nialism-has usually been commemorated and legitimated through the foundation of independent nation-States. So, also, nationalism has supplied the revolutionary vocabulary for various decolonisation struggles, and it has long been acknow- ledged as the political vector through which disparate anti-colonial movements acquire a cohesive revolutionary shape and form. Or, to put this differently, through its focus on a common enemy, nationalism elicits and integrates the randomly distributed energies of miscellaneous popular move- ments. Thus, for example, Indian nationalism, as Ranajit Guha writes, achieves its entitlement through the systematic mobilisa- tion, regulation, disciplining and harnessing of 'subaltern' energy (Guha 1992).
In another context, Fanon similarly foregrounds national- ism's capacity to distil a shared experience of dominance. Nationalism, Fanon argues, responds to the violence of colo- nialism by augmenting a vertical solidarity between the peasantry, workers, capitalists, feudal landowners and the bourgeoisie elite. Moreover, this consolidated counteroffensive serves another end-it revolutionises the most retrograde and moribund aspects of the colonised society: ""This people that has lost its birthright, that is used to living in the narrow circle of feuds and rivalries, will now proceed in an atmosphere of solemnity to cleanse and purify the face of the nation as it appears in the various localities' (Fanon 1990, p. 105).
Although Fanon's writings maintain a deep ambivalence toward the political desirability of an entrenched and cen- tralised postcolonial nation-State, he remains unequivocally committed to the therapeutic necessity of anti-colonial national agitation. While nationalism comes under suspicion as the only legitimate end of decolonisation, it is nevertheless postulated as the principal remedial means whereby the colonised culture overcomes the psychological damage of colonial racism. Thus, in The Wretched of the Earth Fanon privileges nationalism for its capacity to heal the historical wounds inflicted by the 'Manichean' structure of colonial culture which confines the colonised to a liminal, barely human existence. In this context, 111

POSTCOLONIAL THEORY
nationalism responds to the urgent task of rehumanisation, of regaining an Edenic wholeness. It becomes a process of reterritorialisation and repossession which replaces the 'two- fold citizenship' of colonial culture with a radically unified counter-culture. By challenging the fallacious racial priority of the coloniser, the native, Fanon tells us, discovers the coura- geous idiom of equality: 'For if, in fact, my life is worth as much as the settler's, his glance no longer shrivels me up nor freezes me, and his voice no longer turns me into stone. I am no longer on tenterhooks in his presence; in fact, I don't give a damn for him' (Fanon 1990, p. 35). In his extensive writings on swaraj-or self-rule-in India, Gandhi defends the nation- alist project in similar terms for its incitement to abhaya, or fearlessness. So also, Ngugi, Cabral and Mboya, among others, have variously extolled the recuperative benefits of anti-colo- nial nationalisms within Africa.
Writers like Benita Parry add a further dimension to the defence of anti-colonial nationalism by arguing that the memory of anti-colonial nationalisms in Asia and Africa might help to politicise the abstract discursivity of some postcolonial theory. Parry maintains that the ideologically correct censuring of 'nativist' resistance is tantamount to a rewriting of the anti-colonial archive. Given its poststructuralist inheritance, recent postcolonial critique tends to favour those varieties of counter-hegemonic anti-colonialisms which subvert rather than reverse the chronic oppositions of colonial discourse. This theoretical bias-fully developed in some of Homi Bhabha's work-seeks evidence for the dispersed and dislocated subjec- tivity of the colonised which, we are told, defies containment within colonialism's ideological apparatus. Within this reason- ing, the native insurgent is shown to confound the logic of colonial domination through a refusal to occupy his/her des- ignated subject position within colonialism's discursive cartography. In fact, for a writer like Bhabha, the slippery colonised subject is intrinsically unassimilable within the ideo- logical boundaries of Fanon's Manichean colonial city. Without discounting the transgressive availability of such polysemic anti-colonial subjectivities, in deference to a sense of realpolitik
112
IMAGINING COMMUNITY
we still need to listen carefully to, for example, Fanon's categorical delineation of a situated, monolithic and combative national identity. And, as Parry argues, in order to do justice to the politics elaborated by anti-colonial revolutionaries like Fanon, 'it is surely necessary to refrain from a sanctimonious reproof of modes of writing resistance which do not conform to contemporary theoretical rules about discursive radicalism' (Parry 1994, p. 179). It may well be true that nativism fails ultimately to divest itself of the hierarchical divisions which inform the colonial relationship. Nevertheless, anti-colonial counter-narratives, as Parry insists:
did challenge, subvert and undermine the ruling ideologies, and nowhere more so than in overthrowing the hierarchy of coloniser/colonised, the speech and stance of the colonised refusing a position of subjugation and dispensing with the terms of the coloniser's definitions (1994, p. 176). Even if nationalism is theoretically 'outmoded', still consti- tutes the albeit forgotten-revolutionary archive of contemporary postcoloniality.
A derivative discourse?
The energies of the anti-colonial nationalisms under review are, as we have seen, fuelled by an indomitable will-to-differ- ence. In its intensely recuperative mode, national consciousness refuses the universalising geography of empire, and names its insurgent cultural alterity through the nation—as ‘Indian', 'Kenyan', 'Algerian' etcetera. And yet herein lies the paradox at the heart of anti-colonial nationalism. It is generally agreed that nation-ness and nationalism are European inventions which came into existence toward the end of the eighteenth century. Anderson, among others, persuasively argues that this newly contrived European nation-ness immediately acquired a 'modular' character which rendered it capable of dissemination and transplantation in a variety of disparate terrains. In his words, ""The ""nation"" proved an invention on which it was impossible to secure a patent. It became available for pirating

by widely different, and sometimes unexpected, hands' (Ander- son 1991, p. 67).
By consigning all subsequent nationalisms to a typology of 'piracy', Anderson refuses to recognise the possibility of alter- native, variant and different nationalisms. In this reading all 'post-European' nationalisms are altogether divested of creativ- ity. They are, at best, surreptitious and vaguely unlawful enterprises posing or masquerading as the real thing.
Of course, Anderson's pessimistic insistence on the homo- geneity of all nationalisms can be seen as severely limited and open to contestation. Nevertheless, as Partha Chatterjee's sen- sitive reading of anti-colonial nationalisms reveals, the terms of Anderson's analysis do vitiate the imagining of nation-ness in colonies like India (Chatterjee 1993a). And so it is that the project of Indian nation-making is plagued by anxieties of imitativeness, by the apprehension that Indian nationalism is just a poor copy or derivation of European post-Enlightenment discourse.
There is a general consensus among liberal historians that the formative lessons of nationalism were literally acquired in the colonial classroom through the teaching and transmission of European national histories. Anderson contends that the vast network of colonial educational apparatuses variously enabled Vietnamese children to absorb the revolutionary thought of Enlightenment philosophes, Indian children to co- opt the principles of the Magna Carta and the Glorious Revolution, and Congolese children to discover the energies which underscored Belgium's independence struggle against Holland (Anderson 1991, p. 118). In a similar vein the histo- rian Percival Spear claims the achievements of Indian nationalism for Europe. In an account which reads very much like Anderson's description of the secular 'dawn' of European nationalism, Spear maintains that Westernisation/modernity forges its way through the mist of pre-modern religiosity, replacing old gods with the new sentiments of nationalism (Spear 1990, p. 166). In this way, then, the literature of the rulers hoists itself on its own petard by communicating to its subject audience the values of civil liberties and constitutional
114
IMAGINING COMMUNITY
self-government. No one, Spear tells us, 'could be in contact with Englishmen at that time for long or read Shakespeare (prescribed reading in the colleges) without catching the infec- tion of nationalism' (1990, p. 166). Spear's historiography corroborates the view that anti-colonial nationalism remains trapped within the structures of thought from which it seeks to differentiate itself—that, in short, it takes Europe to invent the language of decolonisation. So, also, Anderson claims that: The nineteenth-century colonial state . . . dialectically engen- dered the grammar of the nationalisms that eventually arose to combat it. Indeed one might go so far as to say that the state imagined its local adversaries, as in an ominous prophetic dream, well before they came into existence (Anderson 1991,
p. xiv).
Plagued by such anxieties of derivativeness, anti-colonial nationalists were doubly troubled by the knowledge that colo- nialism was itself a type of nationalism. In other words, the problem was not just that the lessons of anti-colonial nation- alisms were taught paradoxically by the (colonial) oppressor, but rather that the rapacious territorial energies of nineteenth- century colonialism were themselves fuelled by the ideology of nineteenth-century nationalism. Imperialism, as earlier writers in the Marxist tradition were well aware, is simply the aggres- sive face of European nationalism. After postcolonialism, the idea of imperialism has almost exclusively come to imply the processes and consequences which accompanied the historical domination of the 'third world' by the 'first', with the 'third world' designated as the proper object of imperialist histories. Thus, most recent studies of 'imperialism' tend to foreground its impact upon the economy, culture and politics of formerly imperialised nations. Yet, writers such as Lenin, Bukharin and Hilferding understood imperialism not as the relationship be- tween coloniser and colony, but rather as a relationship of antagonism and rivalry between the ruling elite in competitive European nation-States (see Brewer 1980; Jameson 1990). The consequent scramble for markets and territories resulted in what Anderson calls the birth of 'official nationalism'-an

POSTCOLONIAL THEORY
enterprise which combined dynasticism and nation-ness to expand or stretch 'the short, tight skin of the nation over the gigantic body of the empire' (Anderson 1991, p. 86). On a similar note, David Cannadine's detailed study, 'The British Monarchy, c. 1820-1977' (Cannadine 1983), suggests that the rituals of monarchism were reinvented between 1877 and 1914 in order to produce self-consciously the British nation as empire. Similar trends in Germany, Austria and Russia deployed the rhetoric of dynastic aggrandisement to instantiate the symbiosis of nationalism and imperialism (Cannadine 1983, p. 121). In this regard, the crisis of imitativeness within anti-colonial nationalism assumes existential proportions. For its problem is not simply, as Chatterjee puts it, to produce ‘a different discourse, yet one that is dominated by another' (Chatterjee 1993a, p. 42), rather it has to consider that, ‘it is, mutatis mutandis, a copy of that by which it felt itself to be oppressed' (Deane 1990, p. 8).
In this regard, we need also to recognise that if nationalism permeates the expansionist politics of empire, it is equally constitutive of imperialist ideology, of the logic which com- pounds the crude rhetoric of la mission civilisatrice. This point is compellingly elucidated in Tzvetan Todorov's monumental analysis of Enlightenment thought (Todorov 1993). Todorov discerns the incipience of colonial thinking in the debate between nationalism and cosmopolitanism which obsessed thinkers as diverse as Montesquieu, Cloots and Maurras. Montesquieu famously retained an exemplary and clear com- mitment to the ethics of an esprit général, whereby the claims of the 'citizen' were to remain secondary to those of the 'man', and those of the world were automatically to supersede those of the nation.
Other lesser thinkers resolved the conflict between home and the world through an insidiously Kantian sleight of hand: the interests of a particular country were defensible insofar as these interests were universalisable, namely, if they could be postulated as standing for the benefit of the entire universe. Hence, Cloots defends the promotion of French interests by arguing that there is no article in the Declaration of Rights 116
IMAGINING COMMUNITY
which does not apply to all men of all climes (see Todorov 1993, p. 189). In Maurras we find a similar sophistry: 'It is a doctrinal truth, in a philosophy very remote from daily life, that the fatherland is in our day the most complete and the most coherent manifestation of humanity . . .' (cited in Todorov, 1993, p. 190). Ironically, this reasoning is unapolo- getically exhumed in Julia Kristeva's strange book, Nations Without Nationalism (1993). While Kristeva begins soundly enough with a lament about particularism, her argument grad- ually builds up to the conclusion that the French nation transcends the pitfalls of patriotism on account of its unique universality. In words strikingly reminiscent of Maurras she asks: 'where else one might find a theory and a policy more concerned with respect for the other, more watchful of citizens' rights... more concerned with individual strangeness?' (pp. 46-7).
Reasoned liberal thinkers have long argued that in its positive aspect nationalism—much like the family—ought to provide an education in good international manners, teaching citizens to gain their cosmopolitan bearings in the wider world. Kristeva and the thinkers examined by Todorov proceed some- what differently, by postulating the European nation as an elastic universal project capable of accommodating the rest of the world-of raising it to the level of the mother/fatherland (see Todorov 1993, p. 254). Colonialism, thus, becomes the logical outcome or practical application of the universal eth- nocentrism which characterises much late eighteenth and nineteenth century European nationalism. In a peculiar sense, it exemplifies the cosmopolitan impulse which so agitates the guilty conscience of 'enlightened' nationalisms. As Todorov writes:
From this viewpoint, the history of humanity is confused with that of colonization—that is, with migrations and exchanges; the contemporary struggle for new markets, for supplies of raw materials is only the end result-rendered harmless owing to its origins in nature-of that first step that led the human being to cross her own threshold.

will unfailingly win, for perfection is recognised by its own ability to win battles (1993, p. 257).
Anti-colonial nationalism responds to this painful symbiosis between imperialist and nationalist thought in a variety of ways. It attempts, for instance, to be selective in its borrowings from colonialist nationalism, and it consoles itself with the understanding that while the colonial nation-State can only confer subjecthood on the colonised, the projected postcolonial nation-State holds out the promise of full and participatory citizenship. And yet, insofar as nationhood is the only matrix for political change, does the anti-colonial will-to-difference simply become another surrender to the crippling economy of the Same a copy of that by which it felt itself to be oppressed'? In Bernard Cohn's judgment, Indian nationalism spoke almost exclusively through the idiom of its rulers (Cohn 1983). Terence Ranger similarly maintains that African nation- alisms simply dressed their radicalism in European hand-me-downs. And Edward Said reads Conrad's Nostromo to insist that postcolonial nation-States, more often than not, become rabid versions of their enemies: 'Conrad allows the reader to see that imperialism is a system. Life in one subor- dinate realm of experience is imprinted by the fictions and follies of the dominant realm' (Said 1993, p. xxi).
To what extent can we as postcolonial critics-concede the mimetic nature of anti-colonial nationalisms, or submit to the paradox that the very imagining of anti-colonial freedom is couched in language of colonial conquest? For Chatterjee, the fault lines of Indian nationalism emerged at the very moment of its conception, in its desire to counter the colonial claim that the non-Western world was fundamentally incapable of self-rule in the challenging conditions of the modern world (Chatterjee 1993a, p. 30). Insofar as Indian nationalism pre- pared to embark on a project of indigenous self-modernisation, it announced its suicidal compromise with the colonial order: 'It thus produced a discourse in which, even as it challenged the colonial claim to political domination, it also accepted the very intellectual premises of ""modernity"" on which colonial
118

domination was based' (Chatterjee 1993a, p. 30). As a conse- quence, nationalist discourse surrendered its 'meaning' to a European etymology. Accordingly, nationalist production 'merely consists of particular utterances whose meanings are fixed by the lexical and grammatical system provided by . . . the theoretical framework of post-Enlightenment rational thought' (1993a, p. 39).
Without denying the acuity of this analysis, we might proceed by foregrounding a crucial distinction between-to borrow Jayprakash Narayan's phraseology-the 'outward' attributes of nationalism and th"

After a long period of comparative neglect, in the last few decades growing numbers of philosophers have been paying attention to the startling contrast presented between Kant’s universal moral theory, with its inspiring enlightenment ideas of human autonomy, equality and dignity and Kant’s racism.1 Kant’s racism is particularly noteworthy and troubling because of the topics he works on and the details of his views. Frege, for example, is an anti-semite but works on theories of math and reference which we may take not to be affected by or to affect his anti-semitism. But Kant is (amongst other things) a theorist of an incredibly influential (arguably, revolutionary) moral philosophy centered essentially around the idea of human freedom and equality which argues inflexibly that it is always wrong to treat a person as a means and to fail to respect their humanity. Yet the strongest evidence is that at least for most of his professional life Kant was at a racist and did not express opposition to race-based slavery and colonialism, only changing his mind (if at all) in the last years of his life. In addition to being a racist, Kant has a theory of race,2 which is partly a racist (hierarchical) theory of race, and it is arguably a historically important theory in the formation of the modern idea of race.3
Kant’s racism and Kant’s theory of race raise questions both for the history of philosophy and for philosophy. It highlights a centrally troubling feature of the enlightenment: the period in which European thinkers developed ideas about human equality and autonomy while (some) European states were involved in colonizing and enslaving large parts of the world. This is something to which we should pay attention in trying to understand both the enlightenment and the development of the modern idea of race. As Fredrickson argues in his book Racism, A Short History, ‘What makes Western racism so autonomous and conspicuous in world history has been that it developed in a context that presumed human equality of some kind’ (Fredrickson 2002: 11).4 It also raises questions about interpreting Kant. Can we just write the racism off as something not central to his philosophy—an unfortunate reflection of his having had some of the prejudices of his time? Can we see it as, in Pauline Kleingeld’s words, regrettable, appalling but peripheral (she considers and rejects this suggestion Kleingeld 2007: 582), or should it affect our interpretation of Kant’s theories? In particular, should it affect how we interpret Kant’s moral philosophy? As Charles Mills stresses, this is a question in the history of philosophy: what did Kant think? And what did he understand the presumptive scope of the categorical imperative to be? (Mills 2005).
Before moving to this question I present some of the evidence of Kant’s racism. Kant clearly makes comments indicating that he sees non-white people, and in particular black people, as inferior. In his 1764 essay ‘On the feeling of the beautiful and sublime’ (hereafter FBS) Kant says that ‘[t]he Negroes of Africa have by nature no feeling that rises above the ridiculous. Mr. Hume challenges anyone to adduce a single example where a Negro has demonstrated talents, and asserts that among the hundreds of thousands of blacks who have been transported elsewhere from their countries, although very many of them have been set free, nevertheless not a single one has ever been found who has accomplished something greater in art or science or shown any other praiseworthy quality’ (FBS 2: 253). He speaks of ‘the fact that this scoundrel was completely black from head to foot’ as ‘a distinct proof that what he said was stupid’ (FBS 2: 255). And while talking about negroes he says ‘[s]o essential is the difference between these two human kinds, and it seems to be just as great with regard to the capacities of the mind as it is with respect to color’ (FBS 2: 253).5 In a footnote to the essay ‘On the Use of Teleological Principles in Philosophy’, (1788, hereafter TPP), he quotes a writer of a pro-slavery text who reports that ‘among the many thousand freed Negroes ... he knew no example of someone engaged in a business which one could properly call labour; rather that, when they are set free, they soon abandon an easy craft which previously as slaves they had been forced to carry out ... Should one not conclude from this that, in addition to the faculty to work, there is also an immediate drive to activity (especially to the sustained activity that one calls industry), which is independent of all enticement and which is especially interwoven with certain natural predispositions; and that Indians as well as Negroes do not bring any more of this impetus into other climates and pass it on to their offspring than was needed for their preservation in their old motherland and had been received from nature ... . The far lesser needs in those countries and the little effort it takes to procure only them demand no greater predispositions to activity’ (TTP 8: 174*).6 In the same text, Kant says about native Americans, ‘That their natural disposition did not achieve a perfect suitability for any climate can be seen from the circumstance that hardly another reason can be given for why this race, which is too weak for hard labor, too indifferent for industry and incapable of any culture— although there is enough of it as example and encouragement nearby— ranks still far below even the Negro, who stands on the lowest of all the other steps that we have named as differences of the races’ (TTP 8: 175-6).
In addition to these clearly racist views, the central contradiction philosophers like Mills find between Kant’s moral philosophy and his racism is based on the idea that he endorsed black slavery. It might be argued that Kant’s attitude to black slavery is less clear than his racism. It is clear that until late in his life he fails to condemn slavery,7 and as noted, he seems to quote approvingly from a pro-slavery text (calling the author ‘a knowledgeable man’ TTP 8: 174*). Whether he in fact endorses slavery may be argued to be less clear; he does not do so in published work and does condemn it in very late works.8 This possible uncertainty might be taken to be significant for the relation between his racism and his moral theory, since thinking that races are different, and even thinking that some races are inferior, need not amount to thinking that they can be enslaved. It might be argued that thinking that some races are, for example, lazy or weak, is compatible with thinking that members of such races are still owed respect as persons—Kant does not think that within races someone’s being lazy or weak undermines owing them respect—in which case it might be thought that Kant’s racist beliefs could still be compatible with his universal moral theory. However, even if it could be made textually plausible that Kant never endorsed slavery, his failure to condemn slavery is striking and noteworthy. Further, for reasons I return to at the end of this paper, we should question the possibility of a distinction between racist views of racial inferiority and racist lack of respect.9 My aim here is to assess Kant’s moral theory in the light of the worst possible case for his views on black slavery so I will assume that at least until his late political works, Kant was not opposed to black slavery and will take his racism to include this as well as his views on racial differences.
A large part of the debate around the question of the relation between Kant’s universal moral theory and his racism has concerned whether, as Kleingeld puts it, Kant was an inconsistent universalist or a consistent inegalitarian (Kleingeld 2007: 576). Some philosophers, such as Eze and Mills, have argued that Kant’s racism undermines reading his moral theories as universalist (Eze 1994; Mills, 2005, 2014), while others, such as Hill and Boxill, have argued that though Kant’s racist statements contradict his moral philosophy, this does not undermine the universalism of the moral theories (Hill and Boxill, 2001). Mills argues that Kant can be made consistent only if we think that he never intended the categorical imperative to apply to non-white people and that his philosophy can be made sense of only with the addition of the concept of an Untermensch, a category of humans who are part of the human species but do not meet the threshold of rational capacities necessary to qualify for full moral personhood (Mills 2005; 2014). As Mills understands Kant, he has a threshold notion of personhood; he regards members of all races as humans but not all humans as persons, and applies his moral philosophy only to persons. Kleingeld has made an important intervention in this debate by arguing that it treats Kant insufficiently historically: it fails to note the development of, and significant changes within, his views on race. She argues Kant improved his views in the 1790s and that the late Kant clearly takes his political philosophy to condemn slavery and colonialism (Kleingeld 2007; 2012; 2014).10 If this is right, then we might think that Kant’s views become more consistent under the pressures of his own theories, which would count towards seeing the theories as intended by him to be genuinely universalist.11
In different ways, Kleingeld and Mills’ arguments can both be seen as making Kant more consistent: Mills by making Kant’s racist views compatible with his moral theory and Kleingeld by arguing that he becomes more consistent when he abandons his racist views, so the theories can be read as universalist despite the earlier racism. Against both Mills and Kleingeld, Robert Bernasconi argues that Kant cannot be made consistent with regard to race (2011). He says ‘[p]hilosophers need to think less about saving the reputation of past philosophers and more about the ease with which moral theories are divorced from practice, precisely because so many of us fail in this regard’ (Bernasconi 2011: 296). Bernasconi argues, against Kleingeld, that it is unclear exactly what we can conclude from Kant’s condemnation of slavery.12 He argues that Kant was more worried about the slave trade than slavery and that his concerns are ultimately about commerce (2011: 302-7). In my view Kant’s condemnation of slavery in the Metaphysics of Morals and Towards Perpetual Peace is clear,13 but setting aside the question of which of Kleingeld or Bernasconi are right about the very late Kant, this still leaves us with problems, as Mills points out, with interpreting central critical works such as the Groundwork to the Metaphysics of Morals (1785, hereafter Groundwork) and the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), where it is unclear whether Kant endorsed slavery but he certainly failed to condemn it. Rather than trying to work out whether Kant remained a racist all his life and what his views on slavery were, I argue, against Mills, that Kant’s practical philosophy cannot be made compatible with Mills’ Untermensch postulation. However, I accept Mills’ point about the dramatic and important inconsistency this requires ascribing to Kant, and how striking it is to think Kant could have not noticed such an obvious problem. I argue that rather than trying to make Kant consistent, we can use the example of Kant’s racism to tell us something about the nature of racism. Further, I argue that Kant’s own moral philosophy, political philosophy and moral psychology in fact give some materials for thinking about racism and about his racism. I start by giving some reasons why philosophers should take Kant’s racism seriously. In part II I argue for the importance of paying attention to Kant’s theory of race, including for understanding the history of the concept of race. In part III I argue that Mills’ attempt to make Kant consistent does not work, and that his Untermensch reading is inconsistent with Kant’s critical practical philosophy. Kant’s theory is incompatible with his racism and the fact that Kant failed to see this is striking. In part IV I argue that Kant’s racism can tell us something about racism, and further that Kant’s practical philosophy has materials that are helpful for understanding racism."

"simpler terms please including in text citations: A brief consideration of the fundamental principles of humanitarianism helps to illustrate some of these issues, from the extent of the gap between rhetoric and practice, to the ways in which political priorities serve to undermine
aid provision. The core humanitarian principles are humanity itself, or an assertion of the responsibility of humans to each other; universality, which implies a need to attempt to offer relief as widely as possible; impartiality, entailing the distribution of aid according to need to those on all sides of a conflict regardless of race, religion or ethnic group; political neutrality, in terms of not taking sides or contributing to strengthening any side in the conflict; and the independence of agencies from the political or other objectives of donors. Details of these and others key principles are set out
by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) (1995). While the first two of these are more abstract ideals, the final three all contribute more practically to the work of relief agencies during conflict, and are regarded by the ICRC and others as operational principles.
The more abstract principles of humanity and universality remain as ideals, with the objective of supplying sufficient relief to all those who need it inevitably constrained by the limited capacities, funding and reach of agencies and the field of humanitarianism more broadly. This inability to provide
relief in any way approaching universality was reflected in the sub-region where, apart from a relatively generous general distribution in Liberia and
to refugees in the early 1990s, relief provision was patchy and sporadic. The impossibility of providing sufficient relief aid to meet the vast needs created by conflict, let alone more general poverty, may support the contentions made by Marriage about the counter-productive nature of asserting such principles. However, it also suggests that these abstract ideals are relatively unhelpful for assessing agencies. The remaining three operational principles perhaps offer a more useful basis for judging humanitarian action.
In terms of impartiality, as in other cases, the tendency was to supply substantially more relief aid to the government side in both countries. This was in part because of the logistics of access, with the governments based in the capital port cities in both cases where civilians were much easier to reach than those located upcountry, while insecurity limited access to rebel-held areas. Agencies that did attempt to expand their supply upcountry suffered abuses and harassment by rebel groups, with looting and diversion of relief goods a perennial problem. While the difficulty of achieving impartiality or evenly balanced provision again supports contentions about the unattainable nature of even operational humanitarian principles, experiences in the sub- region also highlight the efforts made by agencies in their attempts to address this issue.
 182
This diversion of relief by warring parties also served to undermine
the political neutrality of agencies, as did the manipulation of aid by international political actors, who even attempted to limit its distribution at various points in both countries. While the lack of impartiality of provision derived to some extent from unavoidable logistical and security factors, the challenges to political neutrality stemmed from much more deliberate strategies by local and international political actors, with both groups using relief aid for their own ends. The international political bias towards the incumbent governments also undermined the independence of agencies, which were closely associated with international political actors in the view of locals. Where agencies did attempt to assert their independence, this was resisted by political actors, with the regional force Ecomog harassing and even bombing agencies that insisted on continuing their work in rebel areas in both countries: the ICRC was eventually forced to leave Sierra Leone because of government mistrust of its work behind rebel lines (Porter, 2003). Manipulation and interference by political actors thus undermined agencies’ independence as well as their attempts to achieve impartiality of provision and political neutrality.
This raises the question of the extent to which the agencies themselves bear responsibility for their inability to live up to their principled objectives, given the extent to which this gap between rhetoric and reality was caused by circumstances beyond their control (Slim, 1997).
It could be argued that agencies managed to do a reasonable job given the unavoidable operational and political difficulties that they faced, both in terms of their actual provision of relief as well as in their attempts to address these challenges. It is certainly the case that they made efforts
to recognise and confront the problems they faced, suggesting that agencies do not necessarily misrepresent the negative aspects of delivering assistance or underplay the difficulties involved. While relief provision was nowhere near what was needed, and pervasive and prolonged malnutrition has resulted in the stunting and reduction of life chances
of an entire generation, excess deaths from starvation or disease were generally avoided, with acutely high mortality rates experienced only periodically during phases of open conflict when security and access prevented adequate supply. The question remains, however, of whether this latter achievement really outweighs the negative impacts of the inadequacies of the overall humanitarian response."

"""You should begin by defining the informal sector and discuss how its characteristics set it apart from either: (i) in an empirical context, firms and transactions in the formal sector, and (ii) in a theoretical context, the standard microeconomic model of firm production and household consumption. Excellent answers will do both. Some candidates may discuss the evolution of the ‘informal sector’ as an idea, but this is not required for a good answer.
You should go on to demonstrate command over debates on the role of the informal sector. First, you should discuss how large the informal sector is relative to the formal sector in many countries using, for instance, MacGaffey’s work on Zaire/the Democratic Republic of Congo or Meagher’s work on Nigeria as examples. Second, you need to show how development economics has historically neglected the informal sector, with the exception of the non-academic de Soto. A very good essay will discuss de Soto and the problems around formalising informal property rights. The answer should then discuss how and when the state should or should not control the informal sector. A good essay will contrast the benefits of such control – especially increased tax revenues – with the costs involved in controlling the sector, especially in countries with weak bureaucracies. The latter opens up the discussion to the observation that a high degree of competition in the informal sector is the flip side of the coin of cosy, anti-competitive, often oligopolistic practices among formal sector firms, which often collude with government and regulators to raise barriers to formalisation for exactly this reason. Lastly, a good answer will highlight that firms do not choose to operate in the informal sector because they seek to be ‘backwards’, ‘dirty’ or otherwise ‘bad’. Rather, they do so because the costs of formalisation are too high, and they have no choice. Reducing these costs will inject greater competition into the formal sector, reducing rents there and forcing firms to become, in some respects at least, more like their informal sector peers, even as it encourages informal sector firms to formalise.

"shortly and simply, what is the main argument here?"
"simpler terms, including in text subtitles and citations: One of the most important questions in international policy and research is whether justice is possible in a system dominated by self-regarding sovereign states. The International Criminal Court (ICC) provides a challenging opportunity to probe the possibilities for international law to reduce human suffering in inter- and intrastate conflict. The court has jurisdiction in a domain where military and strategic logic generally prevails, though it does not have its own police force and must instead rely on domestic law enforcement or third parties to arrest people charged with crimes under its jurisdiction. The ICC's task is inherently difficult: it can prosecute state agents, including heads of state, as well as nonstate actors such as rebel group leaders over whom international institutions traditionally have scant authority. Its goals are ambitious: the attainment of peace and security, as well as justice for those who commit atrocities. Is the court contributing to achieving these goals, as its original drafters envisioned? In particular, under what conditions can the ICC reduce egregious human rights violations against civilians?

The question of the ICC's impact is important because the court has the authority to enforce international law against those who commit the most serious and systematic crimes. We examine the ICC's ability to deter one of the most dastardly international crimes: the widespread and intentional killing of civilians in states that have experienced civil wars in their recent past. We take a broad view of deterrence and explicate both its prosecutorial as well as social dimensions. Prosecutorial deterrence is a direct consequence of legal punishment: it holds when potential perpetrators reduce or avoid law-breaking for fear of being tried and officially punished. Social deterrence is a consequence of the broader social milieu in which actors operate: it occurs when potential perpetrators calculate the informal consequences of law-breaking.

A judicial institution is at its most powerful when prosecutorial and social deterrence reinforce one another, which happens when actors threaten to impose extra-legal costs for noncompliance with legal authority. Recognizing this complementary relationship between formal prosecution and informal compliance pressures, we argue that the ICC's influence may go well beyond the common assertion that the institution has no teeth. There are multiple mechanisms—legal and social, international and domestic—associated with the ICC's authority that can potentially deter law violation in countries prone to civil violence.

At the same time, we acknowledge what few would have doubted: the ICC's contribution to deterrence is conditional. On average, it has stronger positive effects on governments than on rebels. We also acknowledge that the ICC has so far had little effect in some countries where it has intervened with indictments (Sudan and Libya, for example), but in other cases, ICC jurisdiction has mobilized domestic actors and stimulated important domestic reforms (weak yet notable improvements can be seen in Uganda, Kenya, and Côte d'Ivoire, for example). Overall, our results contrast with the predictions of those who view the ICC as a worthless institution—or worse."

This chapter, like all the other empirical chapters, traces the institutional origins, effects, and futures of a paired set of international organisations. In this case, we compare and contrast the institutional development of
the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the African Union (AU). In addition to outlining their basic organisational frameworks, we inquire into the power, politics and pathologies of one of the world’s least effective international organisations. For what the OAU and AU have in common
is a membership chiefly interested in the preservation of the status quo. Few African states, then and now, are inclined to delegate authority to an international organisation so as to empower it to act on their behalf. Among other things, the chapter explores the origins – and continued salience – of this continent-wide reticence about strong multilateralism. We begin by considering the institutional origins of the OAU. We then provide an overview of its organisational structure and examine its institutional effects. We repeat this analytical three-step for the AU.
Institutional origins of the OAU
The OAU was established on 25 May 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The coming together of 31 African heads of state that day marked the political zenith of Pan-Africanism. It was the institutional expression of a powerful idea with roots in the early twentieth century. In the course of the 1950s and 1960s, different varieties of Pan-Africanism served to propel anti- colonial liberation movements. The rise of Pan-Africanism in this context owed to such figures as W.E.B. Du Bois and Kwame Nkrumah. DuBois, the American sociologist and co-founder, in 1909, of the influential National Association of the Advancement of Colored Peoples (NAACP) was one of the leading voices in the struggle for racial equality in the United States. He also was a believer in and proponent of Pan-Africanism.
At the heart of his doctrine were the linkages he sought to establish between the history of Africans on the continent and the history of the African diaspora in the Caribbean and the Americas. By highlighting, with great eloquence, commonalities in the alienation, exploitation and suffering of ‘black folk’ everywhere, Du Bois threw down the gauntlet. It
  116
Chapter 11: The Organisation of African Unity (1963) and the African Union (2002)
was an attempt to create a black consciousness that transcends borders. His ideas found traction in Africa. Yet, importantly, there the push for decolonisation turned Pan-Africanism from a movement of peoples into a movement of states. What is more, the objective was continental unity – solidarity with Pan-Africanist movements elsewhere was not to be had. On top of this, various groups of African states had conflicting ideas of how to make Pan-Africanism work on the continent. These dynamics played out very publicly in the run-up to the creation of the OAU. The contentious politics of Pan-Africanism ensured that what soon became the continent’s most recognisable international organisation was effectively stillborn.
Nkrumah, the first president of independent Ghana, believed firmly in the importance of creating an ‘African personality’ in international politics, one that embodied a unity of purpose and a commitment to both peace and freedom. Because he was concerned that superpower interventions could pit newly independent and often resource-dependent African states against one another, Nkrumah advocated a ‘union model’ for the OAU. As such, he represented the ‘Casablanca Group’ of African states. This group brought together Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Guinea, Libya, Mali, Morocco and others. But not all of the continent’s new states shared Nkrumah’s vision for a United States of Africa. The French-speaking states of the ‘Brazzaville Group’ (for example, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Gabon, Niger and Senegal) and the 20 states of the ‘Monrovia Group’ (for example, Ethiopia, Liberia, Libya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Somalia) favoured a looser association. Moreover, they were careful not to provoke the European powers (for example,
over the question of Algerian independence). In short, they were keen on economic cooperation, but opposed to political integration.
The OAU Charter was a compromise solution. By leaving no doubt
that political integration was not in the pipeline, the OAU Charter enshrined the Brazzaville and Monrovia Groups’ functionalist approach to international organisation. The Casablanca Group’s normative orientation received recognition in that the document created a Liberation Committee dedicated to ending colonialism. Beyond that the OAU Charter’s 33 articles reflected the statist interpretation of Pan-Africanism that all three political groupings shared. It repeatedly insisted on the centrality of their members’ sovereignty. The significance of the principle of sovereignty can be seen in Article III, the first three paragraphs of which are all dedicated to enshrining a dimension thereof. Article III(1) provided for the sovereign equality of all member states. Article III(2) stipulated non-interference in the internal affairs of states. And Article III(3) mandated respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State and for its inalienable right to independent existence.
Unlike the founding documents of many other international organisations, the OAU Charter did not impose legal obligations on member states. This notwithstanding, the OAU had surprising staying power, despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that it made little headway in improving political, economic or social conditions in Africa. In fact, it has often been alleged that the OAU was complicit in exacerbating the ‘lot’ of the peoples of Africa, a topic to which I return below.

 How the OAU worked
Charter Article VII established the OAU’s four principal institutions: the Assembly of Heads of State and Government, the Council of Ministers,
the General Secretariat and the Commission of Mediation, Conciliation and Arbitration. The Assembly was the OAU’s highest decision-making body (its ‘supreme organ’, as Article VIII put it). It met once per year as well as at extraordinary summits. The Assembly governed all activities, and it could issue resolutions, the passing of which required a two-thirds majority. In practice, however, because OAU resolutions (much like UN General Assembly resolutions but unlike UN Security Council resolutions) carried no binding force, member states sought to operate by consensus. The Council of Ministers was the Assembly’s executive organ and met twice annually. Supported by the General Secretariat, it coordinated inter- African cooperation and prepared the OAU summits. Next, the Commission of Mediation, Conciliation, and Arbitration was designed to become a forum for the peaceful settlement of disputes between member states. Established in 1964, it had 21 members who were elected by the Assembly and served five-year terms.
Finally, a number of specialised agencies were introduced over the years
to support the work of the OAU. They included the African Accounting Council, the African Bureau for Educational Sciences, African Civil Aviation Commission, Pan-African News Agency, the Pan-African Postal Union, Pan- African Railways Union, the Pan-African Telecommunications Union and the Supreme Council for Sports in Africa. The OAU’s institutional matrix was funded by contributions from member states, in accordance with the scale of assessment of the United Nations.
Crucially, the OAU’s principal institutions were decidedly powerless when compared with many of the organs of other international organisations. For one, the Assembly had neither the authority nor the power to compel states to comply with its decisions. The OAU Charter made no provision for the imposition of sanctions on member states in cases of non-compliance. Related to this, the Commission of Mediation, Conciliation, and Arbitration was limited to addressing inter-state conflicts. In keeping with the OAU’s insistence on the inviolability of sovereignty, intra-state conflicts did not fall within its purview. In fact, an engagement in an internal conflict by
the OAU Commission required the consent of both parties to the conflict in question as well as an authorisation by the Assembly.
Institutional effects of the OAU
The OAU ranks as one of the least effective international organisations ever created. Its inability to leave more of a positive mark on Africa than it did owes to the aforementioned deficiencies of the OAU’s institutional design as well as to its operation – during the height of the Cold War
– in one of the most violent settings of superpower conflict. While the Casablanca, Brazzaville and Monrovia groupings had lost their meaning in the 1970s, new ideological cleavages divided the OAU membership.
By aligning themselves with the Soviet Union or the United States (or somewhere in between), OAU states incapacitated the international organisation. Whereas Nkrumah led the communist faction, Félix Houphouët-Boigny of the Ivory Coast headed the capitalist alliance within the OAU. On account of these divisions, it was nigh impossible for the OAU to reach agreement on any substantive matters, whether related to questions of security or development or institutional change.

Chapter 11: The Organisation of African Unity (1963) and the African Union (2002)
The Cold War affected not only the authority and power of the OAU, but also its legitimacy in the eyes of the rest of the international community. President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania famously described the OAU pejoratively as ‘a talking Club of Heads of States’. One additional problem was the OAU’s failure to clarify its relationship with the various regional organisations that had begun to spring up in Africa. The most important among them were the East African Community (EAC), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD). There was in some cases substantial overlap in terms of organisational mandates. This institutional competition was a further impediment to OAU effectiveness.
Next, there is the OAU’s security mandate. Between 1963 and 1980,
the OAU responded to 43 disputes between member states, most of
which related to territorial grievances. Yet at the same time, the OAU’s Commission of Mediation, Conciliation, and Arbitration remained virtually inactive for nearly forty years. During the entirety of its lifespan (1964–93), neither had a single African state invoked its provisions nor had any member state referred a dispute in which it was involved to the Commission. The OAU therefore struggled to enforce its mandate. It stood by in times of large-scale violence, whether in Nigeria, Uganda, Angola
or Mozambique. At long last, the Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and Resolution was put in its stead in 1993. Yet as the 1994 genocide in Rwanda made clear, it, too, failed to contribute in any meaningful way to international peace and security in Africa.
These failings notwithstanding, it would be wrong to conclude that the OAU made no contribution at all. In fact, in response to his dissatisfaction with the international organisation, Nyerere, in 1976, organised the
Sixth Pan African Congress in Dar es Salaam. It was an attempt to revive and reinvigorate the philosophy of Pan Africanism, in this case with the liberation of southern Africa as unifying objective. In the aftermath of the conference, the OAU aided the armed struggle of liberation movements
in both Rhodesia (what today is Zambia and Zimbabwe) and South Africa by providing weapons, training and military bases. The OAU also had
a number of diplomatic successes on this front. Among other things, it convinced the UN to expel the apartheid government from the WHO.
Furthermore, the OAU initiated deliberations about institutional innovation in a number of economic areas. The African Development
Bank (1964), modelled after the World Bank, emerged under its auspices, as did the African Development Fund (1972). In addition to this move toward greater financial multilateralism, the OAU adopted the Lagos Plan of Action in 1980, directed at disseminating strategies for economic self- reliance and cooperation. In the same direction, it pushed the 1991 Abuja Treaty that established the AEC. The idea of the scheme was to create
an African common market by tying together the continent’s regional economic communities. Turning from the economic to the political realm, the OAU helped to adopt the 1981 African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which then led to the creation, in 1986, of the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights located in Banjul, the Gambia. Pursuant
to a 1998 protocol to the Charter, the Commission was complemented
by the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights in 2004. Unlike the Commission, the Court has adjudicative powers. In 2008, said court in turn was merged, at least on paper, with the envisaged Court of Justice of the African Union.

The product of the institutional merger has been named the African
Court of Justice and Human Rights, and it will be based in Arusha, Tanzania. An institutional legacy of the OAU, the African Commission
on Human and People’s Rights turned a page by bringing a case against the government of Libya in 2011. On 25 March 2011, the African Court
on Human and Peoples’ Rights issued an order for provisional measures, including the order that ‘the Great Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya must immediately refrain from any action that would result
in loss of life or violation of physical integrity of persons, which could be
a breach of the provisions of the Charter or of other international human rights instruments to which it is a party’. Previously, in 2000, the OAU
had adopted its so-called Lomé Declaration. It contained fundamental principles for the promotion of democracy and good governance. It was an effort to shed the international organisation’s image of a ‘dictators’ club’. (The image was largely deserved.) It marked the death of Africa’s first truly international organisation.

What were the main effects of the Cold War in Africa?
Institutional origins of the AU
The 2000 OAU summit in Lomé was also the birthplace of the AU. In Togo, 53 heads of state and government signed the Constitutive Act
of the African Union. Two years later, on 9 July 2002, the AU was formally launched in Durban under the chairmanship of Thabo Mbeki, the President of South Africa. Yet the road to Durban was anything but straight. It led via Pretoria, and Lagos and Sirte. First, Mbeki saw an opportunity in using a newly created AU to legitimate and transplant
his home-grown brand of neo-liberalism. Under the moniker of an ‘African renaissance’, Mbeki supported the creation of an international organisation that would promote economic liberalisation and political democratisation. Both were in keeping with the leadership pretensions
of the so-called new South Africa, the former pariah country that was reintegrated with the international community after the end of apartheid. Yet Nigeria, too, had ambitions for a leadership role in Africa. Under President Olusegun Obasanjo, the government of Nigeria was keen to fashion an AU that would resemble the OSCE.
More radical in conception than Mbeki’s plan, Obasanjo’s vision saw the AU develop into the world’s foremost international organisation dealing with Africa’s security, stability and development challenges. ‘The genesis of Obasanjo’s reform package can be traced back to the early 1990s, when he organized non-governmental organizations to develop... “a strategic vision for Africa”’ (Tieku, 2004: 257–58). Whereas Mbeki saw primarily the potential economic payoffs of a greater institutionalisation of multilateralism in Africa, Obasanjo found more promising the AU’s potential for political reform. In addition, he saw how Nigerian leadership in the AU could further cement its role of a supposedly benevolent continental hegemon. Mbeki’s and Obasanjo’s contending international ambitions led to the introduction, at the 1999 OAU Summit in Algeria,
of two competing – yet ultimately largely compatible – institutional pathways to the proposed AU. Then came Sirte. There, at an extraordinary OAU Summit in 1999, Libyan leader Muammar Ghaddafi called for the founding of an African Union in his own incomparable way. For he, too, saw in the AU project a tool for furthering domestic interests. Accordingly,
  120

Chapter 11: The Organisation of African Unity (1963) and the African Union (2002)
Ghaddafi sketched a third institutional design for the planned AU. By presenting a plan for a ‘United States of Africa’, he clearly sought to signal his return to the centre of African politics.
Confronted with a three-way tie for continental leadership, the OAU Council of Ministers was charged with drafting a compromise document, which became the Constitutive Act of the AU. A close reading reveals that the founding document of Africa’s latest international organisation owes little to Libya’s and a great deal to Nigeria’s and South Africa’s visions
for the AU. Most important perhaps was the strong emphasis placed on the legal obligations contained in the Constitutive Act and the liberal norms underpinning them. Not incidentally, the prominent inclusion of liberal norms came also in response to the rise (and occasional success) of democracy-demanding forces in many of Africa’s authoritarian regimes (see Bratton and van de Walle, 1997).
How the AU works
The AU, especially when compared with its predecessor, the OAU, is an institutionally rather complex international organisation. At its founding, it comprised nine principal organs and numerous subsidiary institutions. The organs are the Assembly of the Union, the Executive Council, the Pan-African Parliament, the Court of Justice (see discussion above),
the Commission, the Permanent Representative Committee (PRC), the Specialized Technical Committees, the Economic, Social, and Cultural Councils and the Financial Institutions (the African Central Bank, based in Nigeria, the African Investment Bank, based in Libya and the African Monetary Fund, based in Cameroon). Also part of the AU is NEPAD, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development.
The Assembly is the locus of power in the AU. It determines the international organisation’s policies; approves and adopts the budget; establishes new AU organs; and issues directives ‘on the management
of conflicts, wars and other emergency situations and the restoration
of peace’ (Article 9(10(g), Constitutive Act of the AU). It also considers requests for AU membership. Comprising all member states’ heads of state and government, the Assembly meets twice a year (January and July) as well as in extraordinary sessions. Decisions are supposed to be reached
by consensus, but a two-thirds majority can break a deadlock. Contrary to the OAU, none of whose official documents were legally binding, the AU Assembly issues ‘decisions’ and ‘declarations’. Whereas the former are binding, the latter have only informal authority. They were designed to encourage further voluntary cooperation and harmonisation among member states.
The Executive Council, like the OAU’s Council of Ministers, is responsible for the implementation and monitoring of AU policies. The ministers serving on it can decide relatively uncontroversial matters in the domains of, inter alia, foreign trade, industry and mineral resources, science and technology, and transport and communications, education and culture and health as well as social security. Regional and international security, however, are beyond its mandate. The Council delegates some of its powers and functions to the Specialized Technical Committees. Currently there are 14, dedicated to matters ranging from agriculture to trade, customs and immigration; and from transport, communications, and tourism to health, labour and social affairs. The Pan-African Parliament, next, plays merely an advisory and consultative role. Five representatives from each member state meet twice a year in Midrand, South Africa.

The AU Commission, based in Addis Ababa, functions as the AU’s secretariat, and its powers were marginally expanded in 2009. It proposes policies, drafts budgets and coordinates activities. What is to become the African Court of Justice and Human Rights (see discussion above) on the one hand adjudicates disputes over the interpretation of the Constitutive Act and related international instruments. On the other hand, it hears cases of human rights violations that are referred to it. I will sidestep the functions of the Economic, Social, and Cultural Council (ECOSOC) and of the AU’s Financial Institutions. The role of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) is worth unpacking under the rubric of institutional effects.
Institutional effects of the AU
Under the influence of globalisation, and against the background of the OAU’s institutional pathology, the AU has adopted a more future-oriented stance in international politics – at least on paper. The AU seeks to advance the development of the continent by promoting research in many fields, notably in science and technology; and it endeavours to cooperate with international partners on the eradication of preventable diseases and other social ills. In its self-presentation, the AU is committed to at least partially transcending the statist philosophy that was at the heart of the OAU. Its mandate, as set out in the AU’s Constitutive Act, is different and rather more comprehensive than that of its predecessor. My tentative discussion of the AU’s institutional effects will relate examples of normative innovation to examples of organisational innovation.
In terms of the former, it is important to highlight the weakening of the AU’s sovereignty norm. Although the founding document reiterates the importance of the sovereign equality of all member states, Articles 4(h) and 4(j) of the Constitutive Act represent a major departure from the OAU’s security regime. To start, Article 4(h) established ‘the right of
the Union to intervene in a Member State pursuant to a decision of the Assembly in respect of grave circumstances, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity’. Just in case the AU as an international organisation was reluctant to make use of this right, the drafters of the Constitutive Act also included Article 4(j). Pursuant to the latter, member states have ‘the right... to request intervention from the Union in order
to restore peace and security.’ Both provisions are extremely far-reaching, and nothing comparable has been codified in any other international instrument. As Samuel Makinda and Wafula Okumu (2010: 38) have noted, ‘the AU became the first organization in the world to give itself such a mandate’. It has been observed, and probably correctly, that the OAU’s failure to respond adequately to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and various other instances of large-scale social violence may have prompted what Francis Deng, the Sudanese scholar and current UN Special Adviser on Genocide, has termed the rethinking of ‘sovereignty as responsibility’.
Moreover, Article 23 for the first time in the history of international organisations in Africa makes provision for the imposition of sanctions
on non-compliant member states. Budget arrears may lead to denial of the right to speak at meetings, to vote, to present candidates for any position or post within the Union or to benefit from any AU activity. More revolutionary, Article 23(2) stipulates that a state’s failure to comply
with AU decisions and policies may result in tougher sanctions, such as the denial of transport and communications links with other member states as well as ‘other measures of a political and economic nature to be determined by the Assembly’. These new norms have found expression,
 122

Chapter 11: The Organisation of African Unity (1963) and the African Union (2002)
among other things, in the subsidiary organisation of the Peace and Security Council (PSC). The PSC has the authority to ‘take initiatives and action it deems appropriate’ in response to potential or existing conflicts. In theory, it introduced an organisational capacity that the OAU lacked. For under the implementation of the 2005 Non-Aggression and Common Defence Pact, it also committed itself to undertaking action ‘to prohibit and prevent genocide, other forms of mass murder as well as crimes against humanity’.
Consisting of 15 member states (like the UN Security Council) with equal voting rights (unlike the UN Security Council) that serve two- or three- year terms, the PSC operates at three organisational levels, namely:
• at the level of heads of states (who meet at least once per year)
• at the level of ministers (at least one meeting per year)
• at the level of permanent representatives (who meet at least twice per year).
Thus far the PSC has been active in Burundi, Comoros, Côte d’Ivoire,
the Democratic Republic of Congo, Darfur, Libya, Mauritania, Somalia
and Togo. Most notably, in May 2003, the PSC authorised an AU
military intervention in Burundi, where it deployed peacekeepers from South Africa, Ethiopia and Mozambique in support of a brokered peace settlement. A similar peacekeeping force was dispatched to Somalia.
The AU involvement in the Darfur conflict has been widely criticised for
its ineffectiveness. The hapless, under-funded, and poorly equipped AU mission in Sudan (consisting of some 9,000 troops, mostly from Rwanda and Nigeria) was eventually turned into UNAMID, the African Union– United Nations hybrid operation in Darfur. Unfortunately, the AU’s attitude was like that of the OAU, when it refused, in July 2009, to recognise the international arrest warrant that the International Criminal Court had issued for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir.
Similarly problematic was the AU’s dithering over the 2011 Libya conflict. Although it attempted to send a five-person mediation team consisting of five former African presidents, the high-level delegation was prevented
from entering the country. Yet the AU strongly dissented from the UN Security Council decision to impose a no-fly zone over Libya. Moreover, even after the Arab League had recognised, in August 2001, Libya’s National Transitional Council as the legitimate interim government of Libya, the
PSC voted not to recognise it. Instead, the PSC pushed for a government of national unity. This led to dissent within the AU, as Ethiopia, Nigeria and Rwanda, among member states, insisted that the AU recognise the NTC. The AU finally did so on 20 September 2011. A tentative review of the PSC’s operation since its inception suggests that much remains to be desired when it comes to the AU’s envisaged leadership role on the continent in the area of international peace and security.
Turning to other normative advances, the AU has also, as already mentioned, made inroads in the area of accountability. In 2003, it adopted the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption. The African Charter on Democracy, Elections, and Governance followed
in 2007. And NEPAD’s associated Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic and Corporate Governance also put to the front and centre the importance of respecting the norms and institutions of liberal democracy and the rule of law. What is more, and even more fundamental, Article
4 of the Constitutive Act lays down as ‘principles’ of the international organisation the promotion of gender equality (in paragraph l); respect for democratic principles, human rights, the rule of law and good governance
123

85 International organisations
(m); respect for the sanctity of human life, condemnation and rejection
of impunity and political assassination, acts of terrorism and subversive activities (o); and the condemnation and rejection of unconstitutional changes of governments (p). Inasmuch as some of the other principles contained in Article 4 have been copied straight from the OAU Charter,
the aforementioned principles are in contradistinction to the way in which the OAU’s founding principles condoned authoritarianism. Of course, the adoption of norms tells us nothing about their salience and countries’ socialisation into them. Yet in comparison with the OAU’s reluctance in this area, the AU, at a minimum, has mainstreamed the demand for democracy. Having said this, whether or not the new international organisation can deliver on its many promises remains to be seen. Thus far, the AU record has been mixed."

"simpler terms including in-text citations: Southern Sudan
The first extract in this section is by the Sudanese scholar Joshua O. Akol. It deals with the repatriation of Ugandan refugees to Sudan following the Addis Ababa Agreement in 1972. The repatriation programme was only the second major mass repatriation assisted by UNHCR. Largely because of Cold War tensions (specifically in relation to Palestine/Israel and refugees
 162
from the USSR and its allies), the idea of ‘solving’ refugee crises by supporting repatriation was hardly discussed at the UN. However, the one previous assisted repatriation offered a model that could be used again
to sidestep the divisions in the UN Security Council. UNHCR had been able to assist Algerians returning home in 1962 by means of an ad hoc extension of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ mandate for that particular case. This deliberately avoided setting a precedent for UNHCR to be generally responsible for returning refugees, and thereby having a wider role in monitoring and protecting them in their own countries – which some UN Member States regarded as a violation of sovereignty. The same thing was done again in 1972, and UNHCR took a lead role in the repatriation, mainly from Uganda and Zaire.
The Sudan operation helped establish the approach, and it was used again for the repatriation of people to Zimbabwe after independence in 1980.
In Sudan, however, UNHCR remained on the ground after the end of the repatriation process, shifting towards support for refugees. Moreover,
the agency soon opened offices south of the border too, to respond to populations moving in the other direction. Whatever the nominal authority provided in 1972, in practice UNHCR became a semi-permanent presence, monitoring and attempting to coordinate events. It became clear that UNHCR could take on a more substantial role than had hitherto been considered possible or appropriate. It shifted from support to refugees
to support for ‘returnees’ (i.e. refugees who had repatriated). From
here it was a small step to assisting other displaced groups, particularly
in a region in which nationality could be unclear or negotiable. Bit by
bit, assistance began to be offered to ‘stayees’ (i.e. people affected by conflict, but who had not fled their homes) and to a category which became increasingly accepted in the 1990s, ‘internally displaced people’. Models were established on either side of the Sudan-Uganda border, which effectively set aside issues of sovereignty, and contributed to the emergence of the new interventionist humanitarianism. With almost 20 years of experience, much of it in this region of Africa, UNHCR was the obvious choice to be the lead UN agency in the field when international responses to armed conflict expanded so dramatically following the end of the Cold War.
Okol’s essay was published in an edited collection in 1994. However, it was originally written for his PhD thesis in the early 1980s, and is very much a product of its time (when criticisms of humanitarian assistance were more muted than they are today). The piece is called ‘A Crisis of Expectations’, and one of Okol’s points is that the returning refugees
were attracted back to Sudan by the offer of assistance, and that they
were somewhat disillusioned by what they found. One aspect of this was frustration that many of the key positions within the Southern Sudan Regional Assembly were occupied by groups from the areas further north, most of whom had remained in southern Sudan during the war. They were particularly resentful of the Dinka, who they tended to view as ‘backward’. These kinds of tension later fed into the division that opened up in the Southern Region, leading to the new war in the early 1980s. This short passage focuses on the repatriation exercise.
Now read
Joshua A. Okol extract from Allen, Tim and Hubert Morsink (eds) When Refugees Go Home. (London: James Currey, 1994) pp.78–95.
Voluntary repatriation of refugees is only likely to take place if conditions in the refugees’ country of origin change for the better, and thereby make it conducive for them to return.
Chapter 9: Humanitarian responses in southern Sudan and northern Uganda
 163

162 Complex emergencies and humanitarian responses
The conditions in southern Sudan prior to 1972 did not favour such a repatriation.
The policies pursued by the governments at that time were too repressive to induce refugees to return to their homes in large numbers...Following the establishment of the Repatriation and Resettlement Commission in 1972, the repatriation process took on new dimensions...In 1972, the Commission reported that a total of 219,400 Southern Sudanese refugees lived in neighbouring countries...As the repatriation of refugees progressed, the Commission was optimistic that its task would be completed within the prescribed period of 18 months, from May 1972 to October 1973. However, between May and December 1972, only 44,608 (20.3 per cent) refugees were repatriated, most of whom came from Uganda and the Central African Republic. Many refugees remained uncertain about the government’s intentions and as a result adopted an attitude of ‘wait and see’...As a large number of refugees (30 per cent) were still outside the country, the life of the Commission was extended up until June 1974...
The repatriation and resettlement exercise was executed under very difficult conditions, one of which was the staffing of the Commission. No specific criteria were used
in recruiting employees. The staff of the Commission were seconded from various government departments, and from the general Southern Sudanese population, where few skills and qualifications existed. Moreover, because the life of the Commission
was to be short, little or no training was given and insufficient time existed for them to gain experience on the job...Poor transportation throughout the South also imposed serious problems. During the civil war, most roads and bridges were either damaged
or destroyed, and reconstruction following the war was slow. This reduced the speed with which provisions could be delivered to outlying areas as large sections of the road network remained unserviceable. Poor transportation frequently resulted in supplies reaching rural distribution points very late or in a damaged condition, which in turn
led to friction between the Commission’s staff and returnees...In some areas natural forces also imposed themselves...However, in spite of many problems, the Commission proceeded with its mandate to complete its task by June 1974 and hence must be regarded as an overall success.
One important point to take away from this extract is that in the 1970s, Sudan was viewed as a success story. It seemed to be an instance of civil war being ended through negotiation under international auspices, and the return and resettlement of refugees seemed to have been handled quite well. As Akol explains, things were not so straightforward on the ground (there were problems, for example, with the lack of training), but his assessment is still quite positive. He does not attempt to interrogate closely the decision-making process of aid agencies, and tends to take claims made about returning refugees at face value. Note too that Akol begins this extract with a statement about ‘voluntary repatriation’. It seems like a reasonable observation, but has it been borne out by events? It certainly has not in this border region. Even some of those returning refugees discussed by Okol were in fact fleeing Uganda following Amin’s coup. Later migration of refugees back and forth across the border has been forced rather than voluntary. In the mid 1980s, for example, the SPLA attacked refugee settlements in Sudan and thousands fled back to Uganda from refugee settlements to the east of the Nile in a matter of weeks.
The next extract gives a much more negative assessment of an international intervention to assist people in southern Sudan. It deals with the assistance provided to Ugandan refugees, who followed the returning Sudanese across the border following the fall of Idi Amin. It is taken from Harrell-Bond, 1986. Her study was one of the first independent appraisals of an assistance programme mounted by international agencies in response to a refugee influx. It discusses the situation in part of southern Sudan in the early 1980s. When it was published in 1986 it created quite
 164

a stir, because it was so damning about much of what was going on. At
the time, it was unusual for analysts to be so critical of humanitarian organisations, and in many respects the book set an agenda that others have followed (including Alex de Waal, whose work is discussed below). It makes a striking contrast with Joshua Okol’s analysis.
Essentially, Harrell-Bond argues that the efforts of international aid agencies to assist the Ugandans were implemented, or rather imposed,
in an unprofessional manner, largely by white expatriates who failed to draw upon the skills of the refugees or the Sudanese. A result was that there were not enough competent staff, and often just not enough staff. There was also burning resentment from Ugandans and Sudanese who
felt that they were being treated like helpless children. For Harrell-Bond, this is an example of how ‘the logic of compassion is pursued to the point where it helps to create the problems it attempts to solve’. It anticipates that the recipients of assistance are incapable of helping themselves.
It also helps to establish policies that effectively make the same case.
She argues that it also led UNHCR officers to the misconceived view
that the only thing that refugees could be expected to do was to work
as subsistence farmers. Many had not actually been farmers in the past, and in any case there was simply not enough land available to them.
She maintains that those refugees who had managed to make their lives reasonably comfortable at the time of her fieldwork had done so in spite of the relief effort rather than because of it. The aid workers were operating in a space that was divorced from the world of the refugees themselves. They were constrained by inappropriate rules and regulations, and they were frequently caught up in ridiculous bickering and counterproductive competition with each other.
In 1982, at the time of Harrell-Bond’s research in the Yei River district, the entire relief programme was supervised by one UNHCR officer. He was stationed 220 kilometres away in Juba, the capital of southern Sudan. The place where refugees actually crossed the border was even further away. In Yei itself, short-term consultants were running things on a day- to-day basis, only one of whom had previous experience in management. At the beginning of the year, activities were being run from a hotel room. Subsequently, two offices were rented, but that was done before official permission was forthcoming from Geneva, and there were initially problems paying the rent. As the emergency continued, more office space was required, and land was offered by the local council. But rules about short-term funding meant that this had to be rejected in favour of more rented premises, benefiting businessmen who were not indigenous to the area. Here is an extract from Barbara Harrell-Bond’s book. It gives a good idea of why her study proved to be so challenging to relief workers.
Now read
Barbara Harrell-Bond ‘Management of aid in Yei River District’ in Imposing Aid, pp.82–87.
With no budget, the field office was dependent on the programme officer’s small portable typewriter; it lacked tables, chairs, filing cabinets and stationery − not to mention the staff to type reports or to deal with individual cases. Maintenance of vehicles depended entirely on the few tools which one refugee had carried with him. Six months from the onset of the emergency in 1982, Oxfam helped out by supplying the Yei office with a set of hand tools for car maintenance. Spare parts were stored in Juba. No vehicle was equipped to repair tyres on the road and even the need to carry more than one spare tyre had not been anticipated. Bad road conditions aside, new vehicles were literally destroyed through bad management, as unsupervised drivers failed to check fluids, and on occasion even drove them into the river to ‘wash’ the motors!

162 Complex emergencies and humanitarian responses
were only three lorries sufficiently roadworthy to transport refugees and supplies.
The prevailing idea that UNHCR staff should conduct their work from offices rather than in the field, meant that the programme officer was expected to be behind his
desk in Juba most of the time. This created serious problems in managing resources
and staff in Yei and led to unnecessary difficulties. For days at a time, a storeman in Yei was responsible for directing the transport of refugees and supplies between borders and settlements, and had to handle the large sums of money necessary to keep the programme functioning. Later, when it was discovered he had succumbed to temptation and that fuel was being sold and material aid similarly ‘diverted’, it was difficult to dismiss him. UNHCR feared he would sue, as had another employee (a driver) when
he had been dismissed without following the rules. In the rush of the emergency, few employees in Yei had proper contracts of service...
Few expatriate agency staff have previous management experience themselves and lack knowledge of local rules and regulations. Yet usually work is undertaken as if nothing might be learned from consultation or benefit from team work. Up to this time contacts with local officials in Yei had been largely limited to those instances when a signature was required, or some crisis had arisen which required their intervention. The excuse given for bypassing local bureaucracy is the need for the speedy delivery of relief. Local officials have long experience of expatriates who, in their view, flout their authority and ignore their greater knowledge of local conditions. It is not surprising then, that instead of cooperation, expatriate personnel often meet with passive or even active resistance.
Some Sudanese government officials were so angry they reacted in irrational or petty ways. For example, late in 1982, Oxfam sent an emergency medical team to Yei. The programme officer was accused of having failed to observe some minute detail of protocol and the local government official threatened to have the team arrested unless brought promptly to his office for introductions...
Outsiders continually underestimate the latent anger of many Africans. This understandable response has its roots in colonial experience. Simply paying more
respect to officials will not resolve it, but outsiders could adopt behaviour which did not exacerbate the problem. Most of those that I observed appeared unwilling to bend their lifestyle in order to command the trust of local people. They maintained their ‘distance’
− even during leisure times − in a society which places great emphasis upon personal relationships. Given the implicit assumption which many carried into the field, that few Africans are trustworthy, it must have been extremely difficult for these outsiders to place their confidence in any official.
The programme officer did attempt to set things right. He began by calling a meeting of agencies working in the district (clandestine because this had been forbidden by the head of the Juba office), and later he held a meeting which included representatives of the local government. His willingness to be ‘entrepreneurial’ in contrast to rule- bound behaviour − particularly when the rules were so arbitrary, laid down by distant authorities, and not reflecting local customs − was the key to any improvement in relations between UNHCR and the Sudanese, and largely accounts for its degree of success.
For Harrell-Bond, most expatriate aid workers she encountered were incompetent, and things could only improve when someone had the confidence, knowledge and skills to break the rules in collaboration
with local staff. Even when this happened, coordination was virtually impossible. Scores of agencies, many of them NGOs, were falling over each other to secure funding for their own projects, sometimes deliberately undermining each other’s work. These kinds of arguments have been taken and developed by several other analysts of humanitarian assistance in Sudan, including Alex de Waal.
During the 1980s, war started again in southern Sudan, and many of the people studied by Harrell-Bond were caught up in the fighting and
 166

the ensuing upheavals. Some fled back to Uganda again, others have been living in areas under Sudan government military control or in areas occupied and administered by the SPLA. In this difficult situation a new kind of humanitarian intervention occurred, one based on negotiated access with the warring factions. This is described be Alex de Waal in his book Famine Crimes (1997).
Famine Crimes is one of the most influential and controversial of recent studies of humanitarian agencies. Back in the 1980s, de Waal had spent time in southern Sudan and had contributed material for Harrell-Bond’s Imposing Aid, but in Famine Crimes he takes the critique much further. He argues that international agencies, including NGOs, have been responsible for prolonging wars and famines and for causing much of the suffering they purport to be relieving. This is partly due to incompetence and
lack of political understanding, but also because they have an interest
in sustaining their sources of funding. According to de Waal a great deal of humanitarian aid is used to protect well-paid expatriate staff in their comfortable compounds, and what is actually spent on war- or famine- affected populations tends to make things worse. He is scathing about
the ‘negotiated access’ operations in Sudan, maintaining that the SPLA systematically diverted aid from Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS). Far from helping the southern Sudanese population, it allowed the war to intensify and facilitated the emergence of a war economy in which those doing the fighting had no serious interest in a negotiated settlement.
OLS was particularly important, because it was a long-running programme, with origins in a famine during the mid 1980s. It pioneered approaches for assisting people suffering from humanitarian emergencies in situations of ongoing war, and was premised on the idea that the warring factions could be persuaded to allow neutral relief to those in acute need. According to de Waal, it was put together by aid agencies from an amalgam of Red Cross principles and naïve notions about depoliticised disaster relief. In its early stages, it benefited from a ceasefire in the war and the Khartoum government’s preoccupation with northern Sudanese politics. However, when the fighting resumed in November 1989 under President Omar Al-Bashir, there was a return to the strategy of blocking all assistance to southern Sudan. Donors persuaded Bashir to renew the OLS in March 1990, but only in return for a degree of government control over the programme. In the extract below, de Waal takes up the story.
Now read
Alex de Waal Famine Crimes, pp.148–50.
Several times in the following two and a half years OLS nearly came to a halt again: many times monthly flight permissions were not forthcoming until literally the last moment, and in late 1992 only seven non-government-held locations were permitted for UN flights. Within days of the authorisation of Operation Restore Hope in Somalia by the UN Security Council, the Sudan Government became much more cooperative and OLS was given a new lease of life: many more locations were permitted, and the operation expanded into areas such as building up the capacity of indigenous organisations, supporting conflict resolution and developing humanitarian principles.1
Operation Lifeline Sudan has become institutionalised, part of the military, political and economic landscape in Southern Sudan. Since its relaunch in 1990, both the government and the SPLA have shifted from using starvation as a military tactic to the strategic manipulation of aid, both to provision their forces and to protect key garrisons. The structure of the aid programmes has come to have an important influence over the structure of the military command.
1 The threat of US intervention had become a reality with the military intervention in Somalia, leading to a renewed will to cooperate from the Sudan government.

162 Complex emergencies and humanitarian responses
On the government side, the relief operation has made possible the maintenance of garrisons that would almost certainly have fallen otherwise. The main base is Juba, which was repeatedly saved by relief airlifts in 1990 and 1991. The Lutheran World Federation has run an extended airlift to Juba. Smaller garrisons have also been sustained: UN and NGO operations have been crucial in the viability of the outpost at Terakeka, and a WFP airdrop to Kapoeta when it was under assault by the SPLA in September 1994 provided the garrison with supplies it could have obtained no other way.
The Sudan Government has outmanoeuvred the UN, insisting on recognition of its sovereignty as a precondition for any UN programmes in the country, in both the war and non-war areas. The UN has consistently compromised and been willing to supply relief without guarantees that it will not be diverted to the army or used to feed civilians abducted during counter-insurgency operations. Operationality has again triumphed over principle. The level of monitoring and evaluation has been extremely poor, and was criticised in the 1996 official review of OLS...
The position of the SPLA with regard to relief is...complex. Until late 1991, the SPLA’s rear base was in Ethiopia. Its political organisation was modelled on the Dergue [the former socialist government of Ethiopia], which was its patron, supplying arms, training, a radio station, and security facilities. Several huge refugee camps in Gambella region received large amounts of international relief supplies, the distribution of which was
not monitored. Colonel John Garang was quartermaster for the movement courtesy of UNHCR and Ethiopian security − a pattern familiar from Mengistu [Dergue’s leader] himself and the UN Emergency Office in Ethiopia. This arrangement in turn meant that the SPLA had little need to develop reciprocal relations with the inhabitants of the areas under its control; its guarantors were weapons and external patronage. Only in 1988 was the need to provide services to maintain civilians in the ‘liberated’ areas belatedly recognised. One of the chief roles of the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation association (SRRA) was facilitating a flow of relief that could also help provision the SPLA itself... International donors were never prepared to entrust significant resources to the SRRA, which soon became no more than a coordinator for the operations of international agencies on the ground.
The defeat of Mengistu in May 1991 removed the SPLA’s source of supplies, and about 300,000 refugees suddenly returned to Southern Sudan [from Ethiopia]. The absence of internal political mobilisation immediately became apparent. Several regional commands were left militarily vulnerable and without provisions, and the bitterness from years of internal repression surfaced. The SPLA split, with two commanders in Upper Nile, Riek Machar and Lam Akol, forming the ‘Nasir Faction’. The viability of the split was enhanced by the fact that there were, briefly, large camps of returnees from Ethiopia in Nasir, which were attracting international relief and could provide an independent source of sustenance for the forces.
Meanwhile, the fact that OLS and foreign relief agencies were delivering relief directly
to numerous locations across the South meant that the opportunities for large-scale diversion at source no longer existed. To the extent that aid could now be used to provision the SPLA, it was in the hands of local commanders, who duly used the opportunities they had. One of Garang’s major sources of centralising power was removed. Combined with the absence of centralised arms supplies from abroad and the lack of political mobilisation, this contributed to a process of military fragmentation. In one instance, William Nyuon, the then breakaway commander controlling Lafon, appears to have deliberately maintained a camp of displaced people in a state of malnutrition in order to attract international relief supplies, which were then used to provision his forces.
According to de Waal, by 1994, the diversion of relief supplies by both the SPLA factions and the Sudan Government had become so established that there was talk of openly agreeing to allocate a proportion of supplies to military groups. However, this was rejected in favour of maintaining the fiction that OLS only assisted civilians. The consequence was that, far
 168

from being neutral, what he calls the ‘humanitarian international’ became inextricably bound up in the political economy of war.
De Waal’s devastating critique in Famine Crimes and in his other writings, contributed significantly to the general sense of crisis with the world of humanitarian aid agencies. As one important Médecins Sans Frontières report accepted, relief operations can ‘reinforce the war parties and extend the war’ (Médecins Sans Frontières, 1997, p.2). De Waal’s work on Sudan, and that
of other influential analysts such as Mark Duffield, David Rieff and David Keen, has also helped establish Sudan as a paradigm of aid failure, a model of what not to do. It is nevertheless still being done, even in Sudan. The flood of aid agencies to Darfur since 2003 suggests that the lessons that de Waal and others have tried to preach have not been adequately institutionalised. But are things quite as bad as they seem, and what is the alternative?
Dilemmas of humanitarian policy have been discussed in other chapters, but a few specific points are appropriate here. First, there is no doubt that the suffering of populations in Sudan has been immense. Was there any other way that they might have been helped? Surely the argument about aid sustaining war would be stronger if the resources had just been handed over to the SPLA. Alternatively, aid might only have been provided through the Government of Sudan, but government policies were oppressive to
say the least, and it is highly unlikely that southern Sudanese populations would have been prioritised for assistance. It is also worth noting that
the arrangements that have become institutionalised as part of OLS have been crucial in the peace negotiations and the current arrangements for a settlement.
Second, de Waal and Harrell-Bond are open to the criticism of generalising from particular incidents and extreme cases. Were there not also many people who received food and water, medical care and non-military economic opportunities from OLS? In Harrell-Bond’s case, perhaps her relentless criticism of the choices made by particular expatriates and aid agencies makes her fall into the trap of underestimating the capacities of the refugees. This is ironic, considering that she was one of the first champions of refugee agency. Far from being unable to sustain themselves through agricultural production, the refugees she studied around Yei tended to become both successful farmers and traders. Most of them only returned to Uganda very reluctantly in the late 1980s when the SPLA began to operate in the area
and the security situation deteriorated. Those Tim Allen interviewed after their return to Uganda tended to describe the assistance they had received in glowing terms, and contrasted it to the lack of services available in northern Uganda. So maybe the situation was more mixed than the literature suggests.
Third, have the criticisms of humanitarian assistance in Sudan seemed so compelling because they have taken place within a state that is perceived to be failing? The inadequacies of aid have appeared to compound the problems of governance. But are they really the cause of it? The very idea of Sudan as a cohesive nation state in the modern sense has always been rather quixotic. A final settlement of the current war, if it happens, may well involve dividing the country up into more manageable units. This point becomes telling when we move south of the border. Here we find aid programmes have not been dissimilar to those in southern Sudan. Indeed, the same agencies and even the same staff have sometimes been involved, and Ugandan operations have in certain respects been modelled on those going on in Sudan. Yet, by and large, they are deemed to have been efficient and successful – why? A key difference is that they have taken place in the context of a state that has been viewed as economically and politically successful since the late 1980s. For all the specific inadequacies that have been noted of particular interventions,

what does it say about trade?
"simpler terms including in-text citations: One of the most welcome developments in economics over the last twenty-five
years is the resurgence of interest in institutions. The conceptual work of North

(1981) and Williamson (1985) on why institutions are important, along with theo-
retical developments in the economics of contracts and organizations, set the stage

for a large empirical literature that documents the enormous differences in institu-
tions across countries, and goes on to argue that these can explain a large part of

cross-country differences in output per capita.
A large part of the debate today about institutions centres around this last
claim. The problem, as the literature well recognizes, is that institutions are at least
partly endogenous: they are as likely to be the product of things that are going
on in the economy, as the cause. The seminal paper by Acemoglu, Johnson and
Robinson (2001) (henceforth AJR), tries to address this issue by focusing on the parts
of the variation in the institutional environment that are the result of one specific
incident in their history – the experience of European settlers when they first
arrived in the country. In their story, if the early European settlers experienced
high mortality the colony was never heavily settled by Europeans. The institutional
structure in the colony then evolved in a way that would make it possible for a small
number of Europeans to rule over an overwhelming majority of non-Europeans.
Where early settler survival was easier, Europeans settled in larger numbers and
the institutions evolved very differently.
Sokoloff and Engerman (2000), in their equally seminal contribution, emphasize
the variation in institutions that resulted from the fact that in the 17th and 18th
centuries, different colonies represented different economic opportunities to the

422 Banerjee and Ghatak

colonists. In particular, colonies whose geography favoured labour-intensive products
that happened to be in demand at that time (such as sugar-cane plantations and
mines), ended up with a large underclass of slaves and almost-slaves, and institutions
aimed at keeping them in their places.
The important series of papers by Shleifer and his collaborators (see, for
example, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1998; Djankov, La Porta,
Lopez-de-Silanes and Shleifer, 2003; Glaeser and Shleifer, 2002) on legal institutions
emphasize the influence of the colonizing country. The presumption is that the
identity of the colonizer was an accident that imprinted the legal system of the
colonizer onto the colonized country.
In each of these papers and their many follow-ups, the primary source of variation
is something that happened a long time ago, that, at least apparently, seems to have
very little to do with economic fortunes of the country today. In this sense, it has
the potential to be an ideal instrument for institutions. On the other hand, it is not
easy to see how it would pass the exclusion restriction test – that would require us
to believe that the only reason why the colonial encounter remains salient today is
because it shaped institutions, and not because it influenced, for example, language,
culture or the nature of the elite. So it remains possible that institutions are taking
the blame for other, less easily measured, manifestations of the colonial experience.
The literature, of course, is entirely aware of this possibility. Acemoglu and
Johnson (2004) argue that their interpretation of the reduced form relation between
historical accidents and economic performance today, as the effect of certain
specific institutions, works better than other interpretations that the data allows.
Glaeser and Shleifer (2004) disagree and suggest a different interpretation. They
argue that human capital is a more basic source of growth than are institutions and
that it is economic development that leads to the improvement of political institutions
rather than the other way round. In the end however this is not a question that
the data can entirely resolve.
It is worth asking, however, what we would do if, by some miracle, we did
learn the truth about this question and it turned out that it was indeed certain
specific economic institutions that made the difference. Should we expect things
to take off as soon as we set up these new institutions? Or do we think it could be a
long wait before we see an impact? The evidence cited above, does not help us
here, since it deliberately focuses on institutions that were the result of a historical
process that lasted hundreds of years. However when this process is played in
reverse, in other words when an institution is abolished, the data seem to suggest
that the effects do not go away immediately. Banerjee and Iyer (2004) find that the
effects of British land tenure institutions in India persist (and indeed seem to grow)
long after the British have left India and these institutions have formally been

abolished. Banerjee and Iyer argue that these effects are not driven by the endog-
eneity of these institutions or omitted variables but by the fact that these institu-
tions and the inequities that they created shaped subsequent policies and also

generated a conflictual environment that negatively affected resolution of collective

Introduction to the Symposium on Institutions and Economic Performance 423

action problems. The paper by Hoff and Pandey in this issue confirms that past
inequities and antagonisms may continue to be relevant even though the formal
institutions supporting them may no longer be salient through the collective
memory of the people in these areas. They show that while the caste system in
modern day India has no formal institutional legitimacy, it continues to have an
effect because people have internalized the stereotypes it created.

It is possible, however, that this evidence is also misleading, since the underly-
ing institutions in both these examples were notoriously associated with a long

history of oppression. One might imagine that the average institution does not
come with such a burden, but in making such distinctions between different types
of institutions we are relying on some theory of institutions that has not been
properly articulated. When we talk about instutions, we have the broad notion
that they impose a certain necessary orderliness and predictability on economic

transactions, but we usually do not say exactly how this is achieved. Is a creditor-
protection clause important because of its direct instrumental benefits to creditors,

in which case the effect might be immediate? Or does it primarily provide a focal
point or a default, around which private citizens build their much more complex
private rules (as Hoff and Pandey suggest), in which case there may be a complex
and drawn-out process of learning and coordinating before there is any impact? Or
is it mainly a signal of the broader intentions of the state towards the business sector,
in which case the effect will depend on what other laws are being instituted?
This is one place where a more micro approach would clearly help. By talking
about one specific institution, it would make it easier to have a richer theory of
how exactly the institution functions as well as to look at evidence on how exactly
and on what time-scale it has an impact. Consider, for example, Goldstein and
Udry’s (2004) study of communal land tenure in Ghana. Under this system, village
politicians allocate land based on perceived need and political influence. Under
the prevailing norms, land cannot be taken away while being cultivated but it can be
taken away while it is being fallowed. Those who are politically less well-connected,
therefore try not to keep land fallow, and this hurts productivity. On the other
hand, it is not clear how we are supposed to think about the impact of policy
reforms here, since the institution of communal tenure is a part of a broader set of
traditional institutions that govern a very large part of life in rural Ghana.

In a sense, the above discussion points to a more general problem for the liter-
ature on institutions: how should we think about where institutions come from?

Clearly the whole question of what kind of institutions we should aim for would
be of little relevance if we took the so-called positive economics view (following
Friedman, 1953) which says that economists should always assume that the world
knows better and hence should stay away from criticizing the institutions we
observe. Fortunately over the last twenty-five years, the economics profession has
moved away from this position. The political-economy view that has supplanted
it as the dominant view, argues that we only get new institutions when they serve
the interests of those who are in power (see, for example, Acemoglu, 2003). This

424 Banerjee and Ghatak

need not mean that they never do anything that would help anyone but them-
selves: but if they do so, it is to pre-empt a threat to their future pre-eminence (see

Acemoglu and Robinson, 2000 for an interesting example of this kind of reasoning).
An awkward implication of this kind of model is there is not much one can do
to improve institutions, unless one is prepared to take on the elite. The important
work of Greif (1994) suggests a way out: in his framework, changing institutions
requires coordination, with the implication that institutions can persist long after
they have outlived their utility. There is, therefore, the possibility of improving
institutions. However, Greif does not offer a theory of how the coordinated move
to a new institution is supposed to happen. Indeed it is not clear how one would
even go about building such a theory: for the case where the institution just
consists of an informal collaboration of many individuals one can perhaps take a
decentralized network-formation approach (along the lines suggested in the paper
by Munshi and Rosenzweig in this issue). However, where there are many
detailed rules (as in most formal institutions and many informal ones), the theory
would have to be built around the ideas of leadership and agenda-setting.
The role of leadership and social entrepreneurship more generally, becomes
even more salient when we drop the assumption that we always know what the
institutions ought to be. Banerjee (2002) makes the case that it is much more
realistic to think of institutional innovation in more or less the same frame as most
other innovations: somebody has to come up with a new idea, or at least a new
way of combining existing ideas. At this point we have no vocabulary for talking
about what would make that task easier or harder, about how the innovator gets
rewarded, about the process by which the innovation spreads, or about the politics
of the process that allows institutional innovations to happen.
This symposium was organized with the aim of bringing together a sample of
interesting recent research on these questions. The five papers that were selected
look at various aspects of the problem. The paper by Hoff and Pandey looks at how
institutions affect beliefs and can have persistent effects even though the formal

structures are removed. The paper by Munshi and Rosenzweig studies how tradi-
tional institutions such as caste-based social insurance networks respond to

economic development. The paper by Bandiera, Barankay and Rasul studies how
institutions affect the resolution of collective action problems. The papers by
Bardhan, and Rodrik and Rigobon carry forward the empirical research agenda of
identifying the effect of institutions in cross-country data. We hope this symposium
offers a key point of transition: institutions have been given the central place they
deserve in economic analysis. Now we need to analyze them."

"in simpler terms including in text citations: How NATO works
Initially, NATO was not much more than an international institution destined to become an international regime. It was devoid of a bureaucratic apparatus or a permanent seat. Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty only provided that:
The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defence recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.
Notwithstanding this far-reaching commitment to collective defence,
in its early days NATO lacked the integrated institutional architecture
that it possesses today. In fact, the military structure of the international organisation was non-existent in the early 1950s. NATO was an alliance, not less, but also not more. As Wallace Thies (2009: 105) writes, ‘prior
to the Korean War, military issues were by and large neglected, military strength was more latent than actual; the issue of who should do what was studied but not resolved’.
The North Atlantic Council (NAC), established in Article 9 of the North Atlantic Treaty, was the only institutional expression of NATO at the time, and it was a floating body with no headquarters. As a forum for high- level representatives from NATO’s member states, the NAC remains the most important decision-making body of the international organisation, meeting at least once a week. Unlike in NATO’s formative phase, the
NAC nowadays is but one of several institutions in NATO’s organisational structure. Yet it still ranks supreme. A unique NAC feature, then and now, is the absence of a voting mechanism. All decisions are taken unanimously. Although this norm has time and time again complicated decision-making, it has also legitimised NATO policies as expressions of the collective will of the organisation’s member states.
After 1951, the few existing civilian agencies of NATO underwent a marked transformation. ‘NATO members embarked during the early 1950s, as part of the Korean War rearmament effort, on a quest to endow the Alliance
with a set of agencies intended to promote the goal of collective defense to
a degree unprecedented in the history of alliances’ (Thies, 2009: p.116). NAC was made a permanent body and headquartered in Paris. A small NATO bureaucracy was formed and headquartered in London. On 28 April 1952, NATO finally became a fully-fledged international organisation replete with a Secretary General. It was not until this time that the dual nature of NATO – a political and military organisation – was firmly in place. Ever since its civilian headquarters have been based in Brussels, and the military headquarters (known as the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe) in Mons, Belgium. NATO’s staff consists of national delegations sent by its 28 member states. These contingents comprise both civilian and military
 92
staff. Staff are drawn from countries’ diplomatic corps as well as their armed services.
Thorny and far-reaching decisions about NATO’s institutional make-up and strategic orientation are taken not by the NAC but at so-called NATO summits. These meetings of heads of state are venues for deliberation
and decision. The first NATO summit took place in Paris in 1957 and served to reaffirm the principal purpose and unity of the alliance. The latest took place in Lisbon in 2010, where, among many other things,
the international organisation presented its new strategic concept, entitled ‘Active Engagement, Modern Defence’. That summit also resolved to develop a NATO Cyber Defence Policy as well as to craft a NATO missile defence system. Other noteworthy NATO summits launched the Partnership for Peace initiative (Brussels, 1994), invited a first group of countries on the territory of the former Soviet Union (the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland) to begin accession talks (Madrid, 1997) and created the NATO−Russia Council (Prague, 2002).
Institutional effects of NATO
On 31 October 2011, a NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Aircraft (AWACS) concluded the last flight of ‘Operation Unified Protector’, thus ending NATO’s military engagement in Libya. It had begun seven months earlier, on 22 March, when the NAC responded to the UN Security Council, whose Resolution 1973 only a few days earlier had authorised member states and regional organisations to take ‘all necessary measures’ to protect civilians in Libya, by launching a military operation to enforce the UN arms embargo against Libya pursuant to UNSC Resolution 1970. A little more than a week later, NATO launched air strikes to protect civilians and civilian-populated areas, facilitating the defeat of the Gaddafi regime. Although it is too early to assess fully the legacies of the 2011 NATO intervention in Libya, in the eyes of many, NATO has been successful in demonstrating its utility in a post-Cold War world.
In the wake of the implosion of the Soviet Union, NATO’s significance
was called into question by several observers. In fact, in theoretical terms, NATO’s persistence after the Cold War was something of a conundrum.
On realist predictions, classical or otherwise, the disappearance of the Soviet threat should have resulted in the collapse of the NATO alliance.
As Robert McCalla (1996: 452) writes, ‘Both balance-of-threat and balance-of-power theories on alliances predict the loss of cohesion in
an alliance as, first, the threat posed by and, then, the capability of its adversaries diminish.’ Most realists expected that the United States would gradually withdraw from NATO, pursuing less costly forms of international security cooperation instead. As a result, or so the prediction went, the international organisation would wither away. Yet nothing of the kind transpired. Why not? Several explanations are conceivable: First, over the course of the Cold War, NATO had developed a very strong organisational structure and organisational culture. The former meant that a great many ‘sunk costs’ had been invested in the international organisation that could not be recuperated. The latter meant that NATO staff had an inherent interest in finding ways to keep the alliance relevant despite the absence of its founding threat.
In other words, once we look past NATO’s military role, we begin to see that the international organisation has come to play various roles in addition to that of a security alliance. In ideational terms, NATO had fostered a common identity among its members. In some respects, the
Chapter 9: NATO (1952) and the OSCE (1995)

alliance morphed into a ‘security community’ (Adler, 2008). As McCalla (1996: 470) explains, ‘The wider the range of functions that an alliance fulfills beyond its core defense function, the less responsive it will be to changes in the threats it faces and the more likely it is to be transformed in purpose as its external environment changes.’ And this is precisely what happened in the case of NATO. The incarnation of NATO that took military action in Libya in 2011 is only superficially the same organisation as the one that had to come to terms with the end of the Cold War. In
the intervening 20 years, NATO has adapted itself to a radically changed security environment in the international system. In its 2010 Strategic Concept, NATO emphasises its role in ‘crisis management’ and ‘cooperative security’. Also mentioned, under the imperative of combatting existing and emerging threats is NATO’s concern for such non-traditional security concerns as terrorism, cyber warfare and energy.
In terms of institutional effects, it is no exaggeration to suggest that NATO was a most important pillar of European security in the late twentieth century. Above and beyond its ‘forward defence’ of the continent, NATO contributed to the formation of a liberal security community in the
North Atlantic. Despite numerous crises in the alliance (for example, the Soviet missile crisis, the Suez crisis, the Bosnia crisis), the member states stuck with the international organisation, thus generating an expanding reservoir of trust. On this argument, institutional resilience in times of crisis contributes to the staying power of international organisations (Thies, 2009). This is hardly a negligible achievement for an international organisation whose original rationale is all but non-existent."

"simpler terms including in-text citations please: Institutional origins of GATT
On 30 October 1947, 23 countries (so-called contracting parties) signed the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a multilateral treaty that set out, for the first time in history, international standards, rules
and decision-making procedures for the regulation of trade barriers among states in the international system. Interestingly, even though GATT evolved into, and survived as, an important international institution
until the creation of the WTO in 1995, it was initially intended only as
an addendum to what was supposed to become, under the auspices of the UN, the International Trade Organization (ITO). As a result, de jure GATT was not an international organisation, properly understood. It represented nothing more than an international treaty. De facto, however, GATT’s gradual institutionalisation in the post-war period eventually persuaded international diplomats, during the so-called Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, to formally acknowledge that what had begun as a transitional institution had developed into the world’s principal forum for making work multilateralism in trade.
  80
The economic malaise of the interwar period had taught countries
the lesson that free trade needed an impetus. Neither the IMF nor the World Bank was designed to do anything other than to help create an environment conducive to unrestricted international trade. Neither of the international financial institutions had a mandate to actively encourage states to pursue freer trade. Following discussion among some of the Western allies during the Second World War, the UN’s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), set up in 1946 a preparatory committee to explore the possibility of an international organisation for trade. During the preparatory committee’s first, five-week meeting in London, a charter for an ‘International Trade Organization for the UN’ was drawn up. This ‘London Draft’ morphed into a ‘Geneva Draft’ in 1947, and into a ‘Havana Draft’ in 1948, at the UN Conference on Trade and Employment.
The Havana Conference was by far the most important because it
was attended by 58 states (as opposed to the 23 members that had participated in the meetings of the preparatory commission). In the course of the multilateral negotiations in Cuba, a rift emerged between the representatives of the advanced industrialised and of the developing countries over the reach of the envisaged ITO. Whereas the former were keen on expanding free trade, the latter countries, many of which were former colonies in Latin America, successfully insisted for themselves
on several escape clauses from pure free-trade principles in order to be able to consolidate their national economies first before opening them
up to the world. A charter to this effect was adopted in Havana. The document also included provisions that went well beyond the province of international trade. These provisions include those regarding employment and economic activity (Chapter II), such as an article calling on states
to ensure ‘full and productive employment’ (Article 3) and another regulating ‘fair labour standards’ (Article 7), as well as provisions pertaining to questions of economic development and reconstruction (Chapter III). Most of this institutional design did not sit well with the United States. Consequently, US President Harry Truman in 1950 chose not to send the ‘Charter for an International Trade Organization’ adopted in Havana to the US Congress for ratification, as it was bound to be rejected. Because other countries followed suit, the ITO never came into being. It was a still-born international organisation.
Because of the failure of the ITO project, GATT took on a much greater coordinating role than it was intended to play. GATT originally grew
out of talks among 15 governments that had commenced in December 1945, and which were aimed at uprooting protectionism in international politics. Initial bargaining resulted in 45,000 tariff concessions and affected an estimated one-fifth of the world’s trade volume, or
US$10 billion."

"shorter: In Ghana, ethnic divisions and weak institutional constraints led to political instability after independence. Kwame Nkrumah and the Convention People's Party (CPP) lacked a broad support base and faced opposition from the Ashanti chiefs (Austin, 1964, p. 112). To stay in power, the CPP suppressed opposition, centralized power, and engaged in patronage politics (Pellow & Chazan, 1986, p. 112). This resulted in economic inefficiency and eventually the collapse of democracy. Unlike Botswana, Ghana’s ruling elites feared political competition, leading them to adopt policies that prioritized their survival over national development (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2001, p. 112)."
"simpler terms including in text citations: THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF BOTSWANA: THE HYPOTHESES
We can draw the following conclusions from the last section: the economic suc- cess of Botswana since independence has been due to sound economic policy. While diamonds have played the driving role, the government maximized the beneμts from the gems in its negotiations with De Beers and exploited the re- source in a socially efμcient way by investing the rents. It also ensured that the set of institutional restrictions on different tribes and interest groups made it unattractive for these actors to μght for the control of the resources rents.
Although one can certainly point to instances of corruption in Botswana (Good 1994), the bureaucracy has been on the whole meritocratic and noncor- rupt. Despite the mineral wealth, the exchange rate has not become overvalued, while monetary and μscal policy has been prudent, and the government invested heavily in public goods, such as infrastructure, health, and education.
We now attempt to use the evidence presented so far to build a story that can help to explain Botswana. We see the above discussion of good policies and in- stitutions as outcomes, not causes, and seek the fundamental determinants of these good policies and institutions.
25 Pula means “rain” and is also a greeting in Setswana.
AN AFRICAN SUCCESS STORY 103
There are a number of (structural) features that appear potentially relevant to understanding its institutional and economic performance:
1. Botswana is very rich in natural-resource wealth.
2. It had unusual precolonial political institutions allowing commoners to make suggestions and criticize chiefs. The institutions therefore enabled an unusual de- gree of participation in the political process and placed restrictions on the political power of the elites.
3. British colonial rule in Botswana was limited. This allowed the precolonial institutions to survive to the independence era.
4. Exploiting the comparative advantage of the nation after 1966 directly in- creased the incomes of the members of the elite.
5. The political leadership of the BDP, and particularly of Seretse Khama, in- herited the legitimacy of these institutions, and this gave it a broad political base.
How did these various features of Botswana’s history and political situation affect the design of its institutions? To answer this question, we μrst have to note that institutions are ultimately the endogenous creation of individuals. Institu- tion building, therefore, has to be analyzed within the context of the interests of the actors and the constraints facing them. In particular, here we emphasize three factors:
Economic interests. A good institutional setup will lead to outcomes that are in the interest of the politically powerful agents. For example, institutions that restrict state predation will not be in the interest of a ruler who wants to appropriate as- sets in the future. Yet this strategy may be in interest of a ruler who recognizes that only such guarantees will encourage citizens to undertake substantial in- vestments, or will protect his own rents. They will also be in the interest of the major groups that can undertake investment in production activities in the future.
Political losers. The issue here is whether institutional development will destabi- lize the system, making it less likely that elites will remain in power after re- forms (see Acemoglu and Robinson 2000). An institutional setup encouraging investment and adoption of new technologies may be blocked by elites when they fear that this process of growth and social change will make it more likely that they will be replaced by other interests—that they will be “political losers.” Elites that are relatively secure in their position will be less afraid of change, and may therefore be less likely to block such change. Similarly, a stable political system where the elites are not threatened is less likely to encourage inefμcient methods of redistribution as a way of maintaining power.
Constraints. When institutions limit the powers of rulers and the range of distor- tionary policies that they can pursue, good policies are more likely to arise (see Acemoglu and Robinson 1999). Constraints on political elites are also useful through two indirect channels. First, they reduce the political stakes and con- tribute to political stability, since, with such constraints in place, it becomes less

104 CHAPTER 4
attractive to μght to take control of the state apparatus. Second, these constraints also imply that other groups have less reason to fear expropriation by the elites and are more willing to delegate power to the state.
In light of this simple framework, we can discuss how the particular features of the Botswana case might have contributed to the development of institutions of private property in this country.
The μrst point to note is that in the aftermath of independence, well-enforced property rights were, to a large extent, in the interests of Botswana’s political elites, making the μrst factor, economic interests, stack the cards in favor of good institutions. After independence, cattle owners were the most important economic interest group, and they were politically in×uential. As many schol- ars have recognized, the close connection between the cattle owners and the BDP has played a key role in Botswana’s development. Harvey and Lewis (1990, 9) echo the majority opinion when they argue that “Botswana’s govern- ment was largely a government of cattlemen.” At independence the only real prospect for a sector of the economy to develop was ranching. This was done successfully by exploiting the EEC market, and a great deal of the infrastruc- ture development had the effect of increasing ranching incomes. Moreover, the fact that the elite was invested in the main export sector explains why the mar- keting board (the BMC) gave the ranchers a good deal and also why the ex- change rate was not overvalued, which contrasts with the experiences of many African countries. The political elites were therefore enriched by the develop- mental policies that were adopted from 1966. They beneμted from membership of the custom union with South Africa, and they also beneμted from the heavy investment in infrastructure throughout the country. Picard (1987, 264) argues that “the primary beneμciaries of government policy in the areas of economic and rural development have been the organizational elites, bureaucratic, profes- sional, and political, who dominate the system.”
The economic interest of the elites in development appears to be only part of the story, however. As discussed in more detail in the next section, this is true in a number of other countries in Africa, yet there is only one Botswana. More- over, by the mid-1970s the income from diamonds swamped the income from ranching, so one needs to account for why this did not induce the political elite to change its strategy and expropriate the revenues from diamonds. To build a convincing account of Botswana’s development, we therefore need to appeal to the other two factors we emphasized.
First, it was important that political elites did not oppose or feel threatened by the process of growth—they did not fear becoming political losers. The political security of the elites was to some degree an outcome of the relatively developed institutions that Botswana inherited from its precolonial period, which ensured some degree of political stability. It was also an outcome of Seretse Khama’s legitimacy as a leader, which resulted both from his position as the

AN AFRICAN SUCCESS STORY 105
hereditary chief of the Bangwato and from the relatively broad coalition he formed within the BDP, including the tribal chiefs and cattle owners. In this context, the limited impact of colonial rule in Botswana, as compared to the experiences of many other nations in Africa, South America, or the Caribbean, may have been quite important. Limited colonial rule allowed the continuity of the precolonial institutions, which provided the legitimacy to Sertese Khama and enabled him to form a broad-based coalition. The relative security of elites in Botswana contrasts with the situation in many postindependence African countries, where developmental policies appear to have undermined the power base of traditional political institutions such as chiefs, destabilizing the power of existing elites.
Second, the underlying structure of institutions may have also been important in restricting the range of options, in particular distortionary policies, available to the political leadership—that is, political elites faced effective constraints. For example, political institutions such as the kgotla ensured a certain degree of accountability of political elites.26 The constraints placed by these institu- tions may help to explain why, while the cattle owners clearly preferred their own property rights to be enforced, they did not use their political power in order to expropriate the revenue from diamonds starting in the 1970s.27 The indirect beneμts from the presence of these political constraints may have also been quite important: there was no political instability in Botswana, and Sertese Khama could build a relatively effective bureaucracy without the majority of economic groups fearing future expropriation.28 Here again, the limited nature of colonial rule may have been important. Contrary to many other countries in Africa, colonial rule did not strengthen Botswana’s chiefs and did not destroy the kgotla and other related institutions, nor did it introduce indirect rule with substantial power delegated to the political elites representing the British Em- pire (see for example, Ashton 1947; and Migdal 1988).
Finally, it is important to recognize the contribution of diamonds to the con- solidation of the institutions of private property in Botswana. Botswana got off onto the right track at independence, and by the time the diamonds came on stream, the country had already started to build a relatively democratic polity and efμcient institutions. The surge of wealth likely reinforced this. Because of the breadth of the BDP coalition, diamond rents were widely distributed, and the extent of this wealth increased the opportunity cost of undermining the good
26 There is controversy about the importance of the kgotla today, with some scholars seeing it as a “rubber stamp” on elite policies rather than an institution with signiμcant power (e.g. van Bins- bergen 1995; see Holm 1988 and Holm and Molutsi 1992 for overviews of different arguments). 27 See Maundeni 2000, 2001 for the idea that unique features of Tswana political culture were crucial in allowing the Botswana state to promote development.
28 This may have also been important in ensuring that Sertese Khama and the BDP did not need to use inefμcient methods of redistribution to ensure support for their policies.

106 CHAPTER 4
institutional path—no group wanted to μght to expand its rents at the expense of “rocking the boat.”
Our reading of the evidence is that none of these key factors, by itself, ap- pears to explain Botswana’s institutions. So what explains Botswana’s success? Our conjecture is that it is not any of these key factors by itself, but the juxta- position of them that has been important in Botswana. We believe that Botswana was able to adopt good policies and institutions because they were in the inter- ests of the political elites, which included the cattle owners and powerful tribal actors. But it wasn’t simply that cattle owners were politically powerful. In- stead, they inherited a set of institutional prerequisites that ensured that they would keep their political power by pursuing good policies and placed restric- tions on inμghting among themselves over political rents.
It is noteworthy that our account de-emphasizes the fact that Botswana is homogeneous from an ethnolinguistic point of view. As we discussed earlier, to the extent that this is true, it appears to be more of an outcome of Botswana’s political institutions than an independent cause. Moreover, it is clear that polit- ical elites have studiously avoided exacerbating any underlying ethnic tensions in Botswana.29
Our hypotheses stress structural factors, which we believe to have been im- portant. But we do not rule out that “agency” may have been signiμcant. Key decisions made by Batswana leaders, particularly Seretse Khama and Quett Masire, appear to have been crucial. Although these individuals operated in a relatively helpful institutional environment, they probably also made a big dif- ference. Seretse Khama’s handling of the independence negotiations and con- stitutional convention, minerals policy, and generally political issues ensured that political stakes remained low, contributing to political stability and an en- vironment with secure property rights. For example, it appears plausible that had Seretse Khama not transferred the property rights over subsoil diamonds away from his own tribe, the Bangwato, to the government, there could have been much greater con×ict among tribes over the control of the wealth from diamonds. Or had he not reduced the political powers of tribal chiefs shortly after independence, tribal cleavages may have been more important.
It is also signiμcant that when the BDP’s political power was threatened, for example in the early 1970s and late 1990s, their response was to change their policies to make themselves more popular. Contrast this with the response of the Basutoland National Party in Lesotho led by Chief Lebua Jonathan, who mounted a coup after losing an election. Although we argue in the next section that one reason for this may have been the greater political stakes and relative lack of con- straints in Lesotho, at some level a decision to mount a coup or respond demo-

"summarise this sudan example for my notes. So why is peace so difficult to control?
To understand this, it is useful to look at the history of the Sudanese peace
deal. Since 1982, the Southern rebels, the SPLA, had fought the government
of Khartoum. Yet clashes and war between North and South had actually
been a permanent feature of Sudan since independence. Many aspects feed
into this: the South has been continually marginalised and British (strictly
speaking, Anglo-Egyptian) colonial structures emphasised this set-up.
Identity has become very political in this conflict, using a mixture of race
and religion to set the two parties against each other. Regional interests
also played a role: both Ethiopia and Uganda have supported the Southern
struggle because they were also at odds with the National Congress (NC)
government in Khartoum.
It took years to negotiate the peace deal between the rebels and the
government until it was signed in January 2005 – meanwhile fighting
continued. The final agreement, the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA),
is a testament to compromise. It had to be, otherwise no deal would ever
have been signed. But what has become clear about the CPA in the last
three years is its vagueness. It lacks specifics on many vital issues, such as
land or borders. But it was very clear during the negotiations that neither
party would have signed a more definite document. The peace agreement,
although appearing to be the closing document on the conflict, is actually
much more the opening document for the post-war society. It also sets the
public relations stage for that post-war society. Both parties established
themselves as peaceful parties by signing it, but the real negotiations about
how to conduct the post-war society have only started since the deal was
signed. A peace agreement, including the handshake photo-opportunity, can
hardly be much more than symbolism."

our cases of development success do when plotted against the countries discussed in Chapter 9, plus, for purposes of comparison, Japan and
South Korea. Although GDP estimates for China go back many centuries, reliable data for Botswana begins only in 1950. Hence our graph begins there. Starting from the left-hand side, Figure 10.1 shows the takeoffs of first Japan, and then South Korea, rising steeply past the US $10,000 per capita level. As late as 1975, Zimbabwe is still richer in per capita terms than Pakistan, China or Botswana. Botswana moves from being the poorest country in the chart in 1950, past first China, then Pakistan, and then Zimbabwe, as its growth accelerates throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Growth flattens in the early 1990s, but then accelerates again in the second half of the decade, and into the 2000s.
China enters the 1950s with about the same GDP per capita that it had 2,000 years earlier, and about a quarter less than it had in 1500. Per capita income inches upwards through the late 1950s, only to fall back in the early 1960s. In income per capita terms, little of note happens until the late 1970s, when growth begins to accelerate. China then goes through three increasingly faster growth phases in the 1980s, early 1990s, and again from 1999 to the present day. This performance leaves Zimbabwe and Pakistan trailing far behind, and China poised to overtake Botswana around 2005. It is worth noting that China is still ‘only’ a middle-income country, in the same class as Botswana, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. It
is not the high level of wealth China has obtained, but rather the sheer momentum of a billion Chinese attaining middle-income status that is exciting so many businessmen and commentators, and shaking markets around the globe."

"simpler terms including intext citations: The advent of globalisation has been crucial in bringing economic
issues to the forefront of ISS discussions. Globalisation, according to Anthony McGrew, ‘refers to the spreading, deepening, and accelerating of international connectivity’ (McGrew, 2022, p.19). Such actions stem from long-established mentalities on how money and safety are intertwined.
European ambitions to discover, trade with and ultimately rule over large portions of the world were the original impetus for what we now call globalisation. Mercantilism fuelled these ambitions. National security was seen by proponents of mercantilism as inextricably linked to economic independence. A state could only feel safe if it had complete control over its food supply, which was crucial for maintaining its population, and
its raw resources, which were required for its critical industries (most notably those that contributed to its military might). The mercantilists thus favoured colonial dependence over trade with other independent states

(Nettels, 1952, p.105). These mercantilist leanings were given a significant boost by industrialisation, which from the 18th century onwards, demanded new sources of raw resources and consumer markets.
European empires expanded throughout the 19th century to access new resources for European industries and new markets for European goods. Developments in communication and transportation, such as steam power and the telegraph, enabled great powers like Britain to open markets unilaterally and insist on beneficial commercial terms with their colonies.
As the world became ever more connected, by the early 1900s, many people believed that increased economic interdependence would eliminate interstate wars. Why would countries fight with one another if they needed each other for resources? Before 1914, optimists believed that the political motives for powers like France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the USSR to attack one other would be outweighed by the strong economic bonds that united them.
The start of war in 1914 quickly crushed these optimistic expectations. Economic interdependence did not, and arguably could not, prevent the First World War. Nevertheless, what is certain is that the international economy suffered due to that global conflict. According to Robertson, ‘no foundation for a stable, interacting global order’ was established after the First World War (Robertson, 2003, p.156). Between 1918 and 1939, revisionist regimes (the USSR, Germany and Japan) rose to power, and their leaders showed little interest in working together economically
or politically. The inability of any great power, including the United Kingdom and the USA, to impose hegemonic control over the economic system exacerbated these problems. The Great Depression that had
begun with the Crash of 1929 made them even worse. As a result of widespread economic and political unrest during the Great Depression, international commerce and investment plummeted, and living standards fell dramatically around the globe. As a result, states were less cooperative and more focused on their national interests, leading to a rise in nationalism and economic protectionism. The result was a return to war in 1939. The global economy was in a mess when the Second World War ended in 1945.
The turning point came in 1945, when the USA took on the United Kingdom ’s role as the global economic hegemon. Ruggie (1982) argued that the Bretton Woods system (1944–1976) was an attempt at a middle ground between protectionism for economic recovery and the free flow
of international commerce and investment. It combined mercantilist and liberal ideas about how economic security should be prioritised. By the 1970s, however, the USA and its allies were moving towards a different kind of international order in which states would play a minor economic role. Bretton Woods’ demise ushered in globalisation’s second wave, which has since been firmly established within a liberal international order based on interdependence and backed by US strength.
Several factors contributed to the second wave of globalisation, including technological advancements, a string of international financial crises in the 1960s and 1970s, and the adoption of neoliberal economic policies by world leaders such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. This
era was a period of widespread deregulation and liberalisation. Stock markets were deregulated and restrictions on international commerce were removed. Governments were seen as stumbling blocks to economic progress, and self-regulation by markets came to be seen as the optimal method for organising and managing the global economy.

The centrally planned economies of the Soviet bloc were opened up to the impact of the capitalist world economy once the USSR and its system of alliances collapsed, giving globalisation even greater impetus. While liberalisation decreased the tariff barriers that divided state economies from one another, deregulation eliminated domestic control of economic activity inside the states. When Friedman (2005) talks about how the world became ‘flat’, he means just this. He claims that the US military might, the massive growth of non-state financial institutions and the ongoing information revolution have all contributed to the success of globalisation.
Through a set of policy initiatives that transformed international norms, laws and practices, the USA pushed globalisation ahead in the early post-Cold War era. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) are two examples of such initiatives. Meanwhile, the World Trade Organization (WTO) was established to help less economically developed countries (LEDCs) join the global economy. Some pre-existing institutions were empowered by the USA and then transformed by US foreign policy. The IMF saw its authority expand, enabling it to play a pivotal role in the economic integration of formerly communist and rising nations. Since conditionality, deregulation and liberalisation were deemed prerequisites for receiving World Bank loans, the World Bank was able to exert pressure for economic change in developing governments.
At this point (circa the late 1980s and early 1990s), we arrive at the moment when economics enters into ISS. Globalisation is not a purely economic process; it describes the widening and deepening of many forms of international interaction. It is, therefore, an essential source of both security and insecurity.
Those who argue that globalisation reinforces security see it as a central component of that liberal order on which international peace and security depend. During the early Cold War period, the spread of market-based economics was regarded as a precondition for the emergence of liberal democracies worldwide. Rightly or wrongly, this linked the USA’s goal
of global democratisation with its immediate pursuit of global economic liberalisation. Such arguments are primarily associated with liberal perspectives.
The DPT claims that liberal democratic states are unlikely to go to war with other liberal democratic states. They may go to war with illiberal or undemocratic states, but they will refrain from violent conflict with other liberal democracies. It was therefore seen to be in the national security interest of the USA, a liberal democracy, to promote democracy while investing in global processes to speed up the pace of international interaction, thereby extending the zone of liberal democratic peace.
From a more critical or postcolonial perspective, globalisation is a new form of imperialism, made more palatable through a simple name change. According to these new approaches to security, globalisation masks the simple fact that security in IR reflects neoliberal policies emanating from a capitalist world economy. Such critics point out that this economy is dominated by Western states and elites who are intent on maximising their security, often at the expense of others. Behind globalisation lies
not the ‘invisible hand of the marketplace’ but the not-so-hidden hand of the great powers, especially the USA. Globalisation, these critics insist,
is tantamount to Americanisation. However much its supporters try to disguise the fact, critics claim that globalisation is an expression of US power rather than an emerging global community.

Critical security studies of globalisation also focus on the economic consequences of globalisation, particularly in terms of the distribution of wealth. Supporters of globalisation argue that it generates wealth, reduces poverty and gives everybody a better chance of achieving economic security. Critical security approaches instead argue that globalisation excludes millions of poor people from socio-economic development, shreds Earth’s ecology, undermines democracy and leads to a growing
gap between the planet’s super-rich and the rest. It keeps the developing nations poor, with one or two notable exceptions, and rich nations rich. According to these critics, globalisation is a source of exploitation and insecurity for much, if not most, of humanity. In the words of critical ISS, it is an obstacle to, rather than a source of, that human emancipation on which genuine security depends.
In the early 21st century, two events brought into focus new material threats associated with security, further increasing the saliency of widening ISS in this direction:

what is the Washington consensus in regards of the IMF and World Bank?
"simpler terms: Like the IMF, the World Bank also originated at the 1944 Bretton Woods Conference. What we call the World Bank Group today initially comprised only the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). It was less controversial an invention than the IMF because there was
a general recognition in the international community that European states required money to rebuild a war-torn continent. However, the US administration at the time insisted that the World Bank (like the IMF) be based in Washington, DC, so as to be able to keep a close eye on the international organisation. Moreover, the United States ensured that Wall Street bankers featured prominently in the ranks of the World Bank’s management. Of the World Bank’s 45 member states in 1947, the year after the international organisation had started operations,
32 were located in either Europe or Latin America. Yet the World Bank’s membership became more diverse as time went on. Many Asian and African states joined in the 1950s and 1960s with the onset and progression of decolonisation.
Although its mandate – the provision of long-term loans for specific country projects to ameliorate structural inequalities for the purpose of economic growth and development – has remained unchanged since Bretton Woods, it is worth pointing out that the World Bank’s strategic orientation did change several times over the years."

"please summarise including the subtitles: The ICC’s investigations

Darfur’s war gained international attention in February 2003 when a formerly little-
known rebel group, newly-renamed the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA), launched military

attacks on garrisons in central Darfur. The SLA was joined quickly by the Justice and
Equality Movement, a small and more cohesive group with its origins among dissenters
from Sudan’s Islamist movement. The government responded to rebel attacks with a
ferocious counter-insurgency, aiming to break the back of the rebellion by destroying
the insurgents’ civilian support base. The Janjaweed militia formed the vanguard,
operating under the coordination of military intelligence along with the air force and
regular army units.
In a series of wide-ranging offensives in 2003 and 2004, the military threat posed by the
rebellion was halted, with immense violence inflicted on the civilian population. Tens of
thousands of civilians were killed, many more died from hunger and disease, and more
than two million were displaced. Atrocities included widespread rape and the wholesale
burning and looting of villages and poisoning wells. Since 2004, over one third of Darfur’s

population has been living in displaced camps, kept alive in large part by international relief.
The Sudanese government has placed tight controls on humanitarian activity.
Partly due to sustained public advocacy, US Secretary of State Colin Powell declared in
September 2004 that the atrocities in Darfur constituted ‘genocide’. No other government
followed suit, but the UNSC set up an International Commission of Inquiry into Darfur
(ICID). While the ICID report did not deem that the violations amounted to genocide, it
did conclude that crimes equally heinous had been committed. A sealed list of 51 names
of individuals against whom evidence existed, sufficient for them to be of interest to a
criminal investigation, was submitted to the UN Secretary General. The list included
Sudanese army officers, militia commanders, rebel commanders and foreign military
officers. Twelve were reportedly senior figures in the central government. Having initially
sought to prevent the UNSC using the ICID report to refer the Darfur situation to the ICC,
the US administration agreed to abstain from the vote, thereby allowing the passage of
UNSC Resolution 1593. This Resolution, passed in March 2005, provided the mandate
for the ICC to commence its Darfur investigations.
The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) began its investigations in June 2005, but with only
minimal cooperation from the Sudanese government, which declared it would now allow
the ICC to open an office in Sudan. Khartoum instead established its own Special Criminal
Court for Events in Darfur, arguing that domestic prosecutions would debar the ICC from
playing any role, on the basis of its complementarity provision under Article 17 of the Rome
Statute. Unsurprisingly, and consistently with Khartoum’s own feeble internal investigation
in parallel to the ICID, the Special Criminal Court has proven wholly ineffective.
Having analysed the pattern of crimes in Darfur, the ICC focused on the period between
2003 and 2004, when the majority of the violations were committed. While the Prosecutor
studied the 51 names in the ICID’s sealed envelope, it was necessary for the Court to
compile its own evidence and draw its own conclusions. The OTP’s investigations led it
to determine that the Sudanese government was not pursuing the potential cases that
the Prosecutor was considering and that the pursuit of these would-be cases would not
damage the interests of justice and of victims.

The ICC’s indictments and the response from Khartoum
On 27 April 2007, the ICC’s Pre-Trial Chamber issued arrest warrants for two men. The
first was Ahmed Mohamed Haroun, who had served as a Minister of State for the Interior
during 2003 and 2004, and was especially involved in recruiting and deploying militia in
Western Darfur. He allegedly had particular responsibility for recruiting, funding and arming
the Janjaweed which committed a string of massacres and other violations, including
widespread rape, in Wadi Saleh area.1

Haroun is reported to be have been in the favour
of the highest political leadership in Khartoum, which valued his readiness to carry out
instructions loyally and to the full. At the time he was named, Haroun had been transferred
to be Minister of State for Humanitarian Affairs, a position he has continued to hold.
The second individual named was Ali Mohamed Abdel Rahman ‘Kushayb’, a militia

Courting Conflict? Justice, Peace and the ICC in Africa 3
leader who worked closely with Ahmed Haroun and is alleged to have been involved in
many of the same crimes. He was in detention at the time, accused of other crimes by
the Sudanese government, but without charge.
The Prosecutor said of the two that, ‘[a]cting together, they committed crimes against
humanity and war crimes’.2

The choice was politically astute. One is a significant figure in
the hierarchy with command responsibility (though he has been charged in his individual
capacity), but not someone sufficiently senior nor well-connected to the highest leadership
that he could not be sacrificed politically. The other is a militia leader, already in detention,
who could be thrown to the wolves with little political fallout. Moreover, the Prosecutor’s
first move – a request to the Sudanese government to surrender the individuals, not an
arrest warrant as such – was a polite nod towards the sovereignty of Sudan. The two
leaders were certainly nervous. The author shared a platform with Haroun at a conference
in Cairo in January 2007, in which he was visibly tense at any mention of accountability
for human rights abuses in general, and the ICC in particular.3
The OTP is also investigating crimes committed by rebels and former rebels, but has yet
to issue any arrest warrants on the basis of the evidence obtained.
The Prosecutor’s attempt to avoid any overt confrontation with Khartoum was rebuffed and
the Pre-Trial Chamber subsequently issued arrest warrants against Haroun and Kushayb.
The Sudanese government promptly hardened its stance of non-cooperation. Keeping
Haroun in humanitarian affairs was a deliberate snub to the many western diplomats and
humanitarian workers who were obliged to interact with him. He was even appointed to
head an inquiry into allegations of human rights abuses in Darfur.
The indictments were criticised by some activists, and by the former head of the ICID, Antonio
Cassese, on the grounds that the ICC should have been more ambitious – naming more
names and going much higher, possibly even up to President Bashir. This would have been
extraordinarily difficult, both empirically because of the relatively modest evidence that the
ICC could collect given the non-cooperation of the Sudanese government, and politically,

because it would have ensured Sudan’s further obstruction of a raft of other internationally-
sponsored initiatives for peace, peacekeeping and humanitarian activities. There was also

muted criticism from some Southern Sudanese, who wanted to know why the comparable
violations visited upon them were not of interest to the ICC, and why the 2005 Comprehensive
Peace Agreement (CPA) was silent on accountability for these violations.
The ICC arrest warrants were followed in early June 2007 by a formal request to Sudan,
neighbouring countries and much of the international community to apprehend and
hand over the two individuals for investigation with a view to prosecution. The Sudanese
government remained defiant.

Dilemmas for the ICC
The ICC has proceeded cautiously on Darfur, well aware both of the high expectations
placed on it by the UNSC, a range of governments, and the international activist community,
and of the constraints and possible perils that its investigations and prosecutions may

32 Courting Conflict? Justice, Peace and the ICC in Afric
entail. Sudan’s leaders simply do not believe that the ICC is independent of political
pressures and they do not see the Court as distinct from other punitive measures imposed
upon them. They see it as a threat. Along with the fact that the ICC was mandated by the
UNSC, this makes the Darfur case distinct from those in Uganda and the DRC.
One of the Prosecutor’s most important considerations is that his activities should not
lead to Khartoum’s retreating into self-imposed isolation and refusal to cooperate with
the international community on a range of issues in Sudan, such as implementation of
both the CPA (between the government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army) and
the 2006 Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA). This would not only have blocked progress
on the Darfur case4

but also caused friction between the ICC and western governments

engaged in peace in Sudan.
At the time of the ICID report, less than two months after the signing of the CPA, there
was an initial sense of shock and fear in Khartoum. Was this the international community’s
reward for the Sudanese government, after it had at last made all the concessions
demanded of it to bring peace to the South? The Sudanese government’s public
statements at the time tried to emphasise the ‘no genocide’ finding of the ICID, but this
did not succeed in concealing its deep fears. There was much speculation that all 51
individuals on the ICID’s secret list would be rapidly indicted, and that these might include
senior government ministers and military officers.
The slow pace of the ICC’s investigations and the modest early naming of names have
not laid those fears to rest. The Sudanese government’s leaders know well that the
prosecutions might begin at a lower level but track inexorably up the chain of command.
They fear that the exposure of the culpability of members of Khartoum’s security cabal
could arise from the evidence obtained through pursuing the mid-level prosecutions. Such
a trail of accountability was followed in the former Yugoslavia. They also fear that political
pressures in western countries could lead to the same result. In addition, Sudan has its
own history of judicial accountability for human rights violations – that which came after
the 1964 and 1985 popular uprisings that overthrew military dictatorships.5
A second complication has been the worry that the prospect of UN soldiers’ executing
arrest warrants on behalf of the ICC might cause the Sudan government to object to the
deployment of a UN peacekeeping force in Darfur. This concern was repeatedly voiced
during 2006 as the international debate on the dispatch of UN troops to Darfur gained
momentum. The ICC avowed that it had no interest in having UN troops arresting suspects
and that it did not want to be an obstacle to a peacekeeping deployment. The OTP even
quietly signalled to UNSC members that it would have no objection to a UNSC resolution
that specifically excluded arresting criminals for extradition to the ICC. In the event, UNSC
Resolution 1706 (31 August 2006) that mandated a UN force made no mention of the ICC
in either direction. The judgement of UNSC members was that mentioning the ICC, even in
a way that excluded it from the mandate, served no purpose as the Sudan government’s
fears would not be allayed anyway.
The fear that international humanitarian agencies and human rights organisations might
collaborate with the ICC, by collecting evidence (especially the testimonies of victims) may

Courting Conflict? Justice, Peace and the ICC in Africa
well have further poisoned relations between Khartoum and those agencies in Darfur.
It is difficult to be sure whether this putative motivation had any additional impact on
the Sudanese government’s already well-honed skills of obstructing humanitarian and
human rights work for a range of reasons, including fears of supporting armed rebels,
supporting independent civil society organisations, and painting Sudan in an unfavourable
light in the international media. However, the fact that Ahmed Haroun has a leading role
in the regulation of humanitarian agencies is a prima facie case for supposing that his
department will be particularly alert to any possible possession of incriminating evidence
by these agencies.
At the peace talks between the government and the Darfur armed movements, mediated
by the AU and conducted in Abuja up to May 2006, the issue of accountability for human
rights abuses was taken off the table before the fifth round of talks, which convened in
June 2005. The mediation team argued persuasively that, as the UN had already referred
Darfur to the ICC, there was no need for the peace negotiations to deal with the issue.6
Any peace agreement for Darfur could neither provide amnesty (which would not be
binding upon the ICC anyway) nor insist on accountability (as the task, at least in terms
of international efforts, was already in hand). Hence, one potentially divisive issue at the
peace talks was simply not raised in either the Declaration of Principles, the negotiations
leading to the final text of the DPA, or indeed the post-DPA arguments over relaunching
the peace process.
However, the ICC cast a shadow over the government’s negotiations in Abuja and
thereafter. For example, on several occasions, leaders of the armed movements and
independent Darfurians have demanded that the Sudanese government issue an apology
for the crimes committed in Darfur, as a prelude to offering compensation to the victims.
When this suggestion has been raised to a high level in Khartoum (e.g. to Assistant
President Nafie Ali Nafie and to President Bashir himself), it has been rejected on the
grounds that an apology is an admission of culpability, and this is out of the question
while the prospect of ICC indictments hangs over the government. The counter-argument
to this – that the payment of compensation traditionally marks the closure of a dispute,
with no further judicial recourse – has been scornfully rejected. Khartoum’s most senior
leaders simply do not believe that any gesture they make will be respected, let alone
reciprocated.

The wider context
At the time of writing, the ICC has raised the prospect of judicial accountability for
war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur, but to date has not delivered. The
Sudan government is insistently rejectionist and while it remains so, progress cannot
be made.
Have the ICC and the indictments been an obstacle to progress toward peace? As of late
2007, progress on international cooperation, peacekeeping and humanitarian action has
been extremely modest, and on peacemaking has been almost nonexistent. But the ICC

34 Courting Conflict? Justice, Peace and the ICC in Afric
cannot be identified as the major culprit for any of this. Rather, the ICC’s investigations and
indictments have occurred in a context of high-octane confrontation between Khartoum
and Washington DC. Since the middle of 2006, any real communication between the two
capitals has broken down, to be replaced by heated rhetorical exchanges.7
Underlying
this is a calculation by Khartoum’s rulers that Washington can never be trusted: whatever
concession is made as part of a deal, the US will scorn it and simply demand more, until
ultimate objectives such as forcible regime change or partition of the country are achieved.
While this is not the official policy of the Republican administration, many in Khartoum
believe that it is so. The fact that President George W. Bush announced unilateral US
sanctions on Khartoum just two days after President Bashir verbally accepted a major
American demand, the UN’s ‘heavy support package’ to the AU, is seen as one such
instance of bad faith. Meanwhile, the speeches of Democratic presidential aspirants
appear to hark back to the Clinton administration’s preference for seeing regime change
enacted by the armed opposition.
Increasingly, western governments are hoping that China will help provide the necessary
pressure to ensure that policy objectives in Sudan can be met. Implicit in the anticipated
partnership with China is a strategy of engagement that prioritises stability and downgrades
human rights principles.
It is possible that greater pressure on Sudan by western governments would lead to
Khartoum’s cooperation with the ICC. However, the multitude of policy objectives pursued
by the US and European governments – many of them involving some form of coerced
policy change, and all of them a higher priority than the ICC prosecutions – mean that
it is improbable that western pressures will be targeted in this way. Much more likely is
that Sudan’s leaders resign themselves to pariah status, a condition which they endured
and survived during the 1990s.
The Sudanese government perceives the UNSC to be an instrument of American and
British power.8

The same UNSC that has repeatedly condemned Khartoum, imposed
an arms embargo on Darfur, demanded that it disarm the Janjaweed and accept UN
peacekeepers, has also referred Darfur to the ICC. Khartoum simply refuses to believe
that the ICC is independent.
At the time of the CPA in 2005, when vice president Ali Osman Taha was ascendant in
Khartoum’s politics, it is possible that the terms of a compromise deal could have been
reached that would have allowed for limited cooperation with the ICC, in the context of
international support for the CPA and a settlement in Darfur. By 2007, Ali Osman had
been eclipsed and Nafie, now the most powerful figure in the government next to the
President, is determined on a policy of non-accommodation."

You see things through to the end, iron out the wrinkles and ensure everything works well.                                   They have advised me to study the leadership principles, and answering the questions with the Situation Task Action Result method. please provide for every principle 2 answers i can give based on concrete experiences (you can make them up, but base them on my resume), while using the STAR method. these are the principles: Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”

Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer
Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.

Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility
We started in a garage, but we’re not there anymore. We are big, we impact the world, and we are far from perfect. We must be humble and thoughtful about even the secondary effects of our actions. Our local communities, planet, and future generations need us to be better every day. We must begin each day with a determination to make better, do better, and be better for our customers, our employees, our partners, and the world at large. And we must end every day knowing we can do even more tomorrow. Leaders create more than they consume and always leave things better than how they found them."

But rather than focus only on its rather mixed performance sheet, I
want to delve into the IMF’s organisational culture. Doing so helps us
understand why this particular international organisation has remained
so wedded to neo-liberal policies, as defined above. On this point, Jeffrey
Chwieroth (2009) has written a very interesting book on the question
of where the IMF’s economic ideas come from. Because the IMF is, as
we have seen, involved in numerous areas, he has traced the rise of the
norm of capital freedom within the bureaucracy in Washington, DC. The
norm captures a belief in the desirability of capital account liberalisation,
namely, in the removal of controls on international capital flows.
Although, formally speaking, the IMF does not prohibit capital controls,
informally speaking, its staff promoted an abolition of such controls in
the 1980s and 1990s. The issue is of immediate policy relevance because
in recent years capital account liberalisation has been shown by some
scholars to have precipitated financial instability, initially in East Asia
in 1997–98 and most recently in the US subprime crisis that pushed the
world economy into turmoil in 2007.
Chwieroth (2009: 1) explores the origins of what he calls the ‘new
orthodoxy’ at the IMF. Interestingly, he finds that there was a great deal
of disagreement over the interpretation and application of the norm
of capital freedom within the IMF. In other words, he has shown that
the infamous international organisation, contrary to what many of its
critics want to have us believe, is far from homogenous. In response to
the question of what accounts for the transition from capital controls to
capital freedom in IMF thinking, Chwieroth points to the importance of
understanding normative change from within. On his argument, which
borrows heavily from constructivist thinking, it was not the pressure and
lobbying of the United States government or financial community that
explains the IMF’s embrace of capital account liberalisation, but rather
the nature of professionalisation and administrative recruitment inside
the international organisation as well as organisational learning that
accounted for the emergence of the new orthodoxy.
Because the mid-1980s saw many long-time staff retire from the IMF,
a new influx of recruits changed the intellectual currents within the
bureaucracy. As Chwieroth (2009: 162) puts it:
Many of the [incoming] staff were trained in PhD programs in
the virtues of market-oriented solutions. Academics were very
critical of regulations and played an important role in motivating
financial liberalization. As the climate changed intellectually it
impacted how these issues were viewed within the Fund.
Of course, this intellectual transformation was hardly uniform. Some
departments and units were more inclined (for example, the European
Department), others less so (for example, the Middle Eastern Department,
the African Department) to adopt the new trend. The second explanatory
factor, as mentioned, was organisational learning. Here the experiences
of several advanced industrialised economies with financial deregulation
at home persuaded them and others of the need for capital account
liberalisation.
This illustrative example speaks directly to the theme of institutional
effects, for it highlights the independent power of the IMF. By promoting,
for better or worse, the norm of capital freedom, the IMF has left an
indelible imprint on international politics."

to independence seriously registered. The League confined
Wilsonian talk of national self-determination almost entirely to
Europe and allowed the victorious European imperial powers to
expand their informal empires elsewhere.
Put differently, inasmuch as the League of Nations experiment (despite its
ultimate failure) put the world on a path toward greater multilateralism,
early twentieth-century multilateralism was designed to serve, first and
foremost, a lucky few (and leading nations) of the world."

"Als “German Culture Project” thematisiert mein Forschungsaufsatz die Gleichstellung der Geschlechter im deutschen Grundgesetz. Dabei wird das Forschungsessay auf die Frage “Welche juristischen Maßnahmen wurden ergriffen, um die Gleichstellung der Geschlechter in Deutschland zu fördern, und wie effektiv sind sie?” antworten. Hierzu wird der Fokus auf den Kontrast zwischen der Gleichberechtigung zwischen Mann und Frau im Grundgesetz und in der Realität gelegt. In der Einleitung werde ich hier kurz “Gleichstellung” definieren, die Rahmenbedingungen für das Essay setzen und schließlich auf Meilensteine im Frauenrecht aufmerksam machen. Da das deutsche Grundgesetz erst 1949 eingeführt worden ist, werde ich mich auf Gesetze ab dieser Zeit konzentrieren. Dabei werde ich explizit auf das Thema “Frauen und körperliche Gewalt” eingehen. In diesem Teil werde ich zahlreiche Gesetze, die zum Schutz der Frau eingeführt worden sind, erklären, und dann anhand von Statistiken und Fallstudien demonstrieren, dass hier noch einiges zur Gleichbehandlung der Geschlechter gemacht werden muss. Schlussendlich werde ich im Fazit auf die Entwicklung der Gleichstellung der Geschlechter im deutschen Grundgesetz zurückblicken und darauf eingehen, wie wichtig die Rolle der Frau bei der Gestaltung des deutschen Rechts ist.
Die Themen, die im Forschungsaufsatz adressiert werden, sind nicht nur von historischer Bedeutung, sondern auch sozialer, wirtschaftlicher und kultureller.

I am a creative, driven, and solutions focused person and am excited about the opportunity to work closely with Forward College to keep the Berlin campus running smoothly and help execute exciting projects. I have a variety of experience in operations and support roles, as well as leading projects both individually and as part of a team.

During my most recent experience as a Policy Advisor Intern at Cancer Research UK I had to produce a scoping report on the potential uses of innovative technology in cancer treatment. This project involved extensive research, reaching out to stakeholders to conduct interviews and presenting my findings to various people within the organisation. During the internship I honed my prioritisation and time management skills, as I had to understand highly technical information quickly and manage my deadlines effectively. The extensive stakeholder engagement allowed me to develop my relationship building and networking skills, and I utilised my interpersonal skills to integrate into the team quickly. 
In addition, my role as a Communications Coordinator at Screen Australia strengthened my project coordination and organisational skills. Managing daily news report monitoring, social media accounts, and financial documentation required precision and adaptability. I enhanced my organisation and multitasking skills as well as being detail-oriented to ensure everything ran smoothly within the team.

The two PBL projects I have undertaken at Forward College have allowed me to think creatively and come up with innovative solutions to challenging problems. The social project tackled taboo topics relevant for our cohort and the digital project developed a selling platform at the Paris student residence to reduce waste and provide people with an easy way to exchange belongings. These projects had a great impact on the community and  taught me strong leadership and collaboration skills within a diverse team, as well as developing my critical thinking to overcome problems that arose. It was a great opportunity to be innovative and take on new challenges with confidence.

I understand the unique position Forward Collage holds as an institution, it is an experience that goes beyond academics and encourages students to develop skills and opportunities in other ways to prepare us for the working world. There is huge potential for students both at CIC and in Berlin more broadly and I want to help harness these unique opportunities that are facilitated by Forward College. I keep up to date with events related to my field of study and think it would be great to share more of these networking/career opportunities with other students. I would also like to establish an alumni network that supports students as they leave Forward but also allows them to stay connected with current and future students.

Having spoken with the previous Campus Assistant, I understand the responsibilities required, such as maintaining the campus library and assisting with organising events. I feel very confident in interacting with external organisations and people despite my basic German language skills. 

I believe that my proactive, reliable and dedicated work ethic and my positive and friendly nature make me an excellent candidate for the Campus Assistant position, and I look forward to speaking with you further about it.

"please summarise the key points through bullet points: Introduction
The traditional Westphalian notion of sovereignty emphasized the principle of non-intervention in domestic affairs and, closely related to this,
the consensus principle. While major powers have never fully respected
sovereignty (see Krasner 1999), the principle has been widely considered
to be central in international politics. It involves three norms: first, that
the ruler of a state exercises sole authority over the territory of that state;
second, that all states are judicially equal; and third, that state parties are
69
not subject to any law to which they do not consent. On this view, international institutions are considered to be instruments of the territorial state.
The time since the Second World War, especially spanning the last two
to three decades, has brought changes that have undermined Westphalian
sovereignty (e.g. Grande and Pauly 2005). In addition to violations by
major powers, international institutions have developed procedures that
contradict the consensus principle and the principle of non-intervention.
Some international norms and rules compel national governments to take
measures even when they have not agreed to do so. In some cases, decisions made by international institutions even affect individuals directly,
like those taken by the United Nations Security Council Al-Qaida and
Taliban Sanctions Committee or by transitional administrations. Both
types of activities – those that bind states thus affecting private actors only
indirectly and those that affect individuals directly – are indications that
international institutions have public authority (Bogdandy, Dann, and
Goldmann 2010). In general, international institutions have authority
when the addressees of their policies recognize that these institutions can
make competent judgments and binding decisions (see also Cooper et al.
2008). International institutions exercise authority in that they successfully claim the right to perform regulatory functions like the formulation
of rules and rule monitoring or enforcement.
The claim of this article is that the rise of political authority beyond the
nation state requires legitimation and leads to politicization. We expect
growing resistance against international institutions to the extent that
international institutions exercise authority but cannot build on sufficient
stocks of legitimacy. The procedures for obtaining results in international
political processes, the content of these processes, and above all the
concomitant subsystemic assignment of powers require justification. The
‘right to justification’ (cf. Forst 2007) is now demanded of international
institutions, as well. It is called for by numerous so-called anti-globalization groups such as Attac, acting on the transnational level, as well as
by resisters at the national level who seek to prevent the undermining of
democratic sovereignty, for example, via referendums on European integration. The right to justification is also put forward by some formerly
less-powerful states against the dominance of strong Western states in
international institutions. The days of permissive consensus for executive
multilateralism are over.
At the same time, we also expect a growing utilization of international
institutions to the extent that they exercise authority. Only part of the
current politicization of international institutions comes in the form of
resistance. Many transnational non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
and social movements publicly address international institutions in a
70 MICHAEL ZU¨ R N , MARTIN BINDER AND MATTHIAS ECKER - EHRHARDT
positive way, for instance, by calling for drastic intensification of climate
policy measures at the international level. Similarly, there have been
numerous recent demands for much stronger interventions by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and multilateral development banks as a
response to the financial crisis. At the same time, various groups seek
permanent access to international institutions in order to facilitate their
influence on internal agendas and policy formulation, as well as to hold
these institutions accountable in the phases of policy implementation
(Tallberg and Jo¨nsson 2010).
Public resistance to international institutions and their more intensive
utilization are both expressions of a process that we refer to as politicization. We define politicization of international institutions operationally
as growing public awareness of international institutions and increased
public mobilization of competing political preferences regarding institutions’ policies or procedures. We claim that the politicization of international institutions is a consequence of their new authority. The more
political authority international institutions exercise or are expected to
exercise, the more they attract public attention and demands. In this way,
they become publicly contested.
This claim runs counter to a number of relevant strands of theorizing about
international and transnational relations. First of all, major theories of
international relations (IR) and international institutions question the claim
that international institutions possess authority in their own right. Neorealism
explicitly considers international institutions as an epiphenomenon of the
distribution of power in the international system (Mearsheimer 1994). Even
rationalist theories of intergovernmental cooperation do not see international
institutions as exercising authority. While international institutions are
assigned a causal role (Keohane 1984), they are still conceptualized as
instruments of the state, without possessing authority in their own right
(Kahler 2004). Second, international relations is widely seen as a social realm
dominated by executives and technocrats, even when power and authority are
exercised. Kissinger (1957) sees the withdrawal of foreign policy and international negotiations from public debate as a defining and desirable element
of IR. In this line of thinking, Moravcsik (2006), while accepting that the
European Union (EU) exercises authority in some areas, maintains that this
takes place only in policy fields that are not of interest for the people and
therefore do not require democratic legitimacy. In general, international
institutions, even when they exercise authority, are seen as sites of executive
and technocratic governance protected from public and societal pressures.
A third strand of literature about transnational and international
relations needs to be mentioned in order to additionally highlight that
authority and politicization are not simply co-constitutive. The whole
International authority and its politicization 71
notion of political opportunity structures suggests that the exercise of
power, rule, and authority, even if considered as unfair, does not automatically translate into protest. For the transnational level, Tarrow (2005)
and della Porta (2007) have shown this convincingly. An analysis of the EU
also demonstrates that the permissive consensus faltered only three decades
after EU institutions exercised significant authority; this means that specific
opportunity structures must be given before authority translates into politicization (de Wilde and Zu¨rn 2012; Rauh 2011). The claim therefore needs to
be qualified by the ceteris paribus clause; it does not suffice to explain cases
of politicization completely. Finally, the claim that authority produces politicization decouples the concepts of authority and legitimacy to some extent.
The hypothesis that high levels of political authority may lead to strong
contestation about the legitimacy runs also counter to a conceptualization
of authority as recognized legitimacy (Hurd 2007). In sum, the claim
that international authority leads to politicization challenges traditional
perspectives of IR. It opens up a new perspective according to which it is
no longer negotiations behind closed doors but open societal struggles that
determine the content of international institutions and thus important
outcomes of international relations.
Our contribution adds to the analysis of the consequences of international
institutions starting from institutionalist theory in IR. In contrast to work
analyzing the effectiveness of international institutions (e.g. Haas, Keohane,
and Levy 1993; Miles et al. 2002), compliance with international institutions (e.g. Chayes and Chayes 1995; Downs, Rocke, and Barsoom 1996;
Tallberg 2002), or the distributive effects of international regimes (Krasner
1991; Helleiner 1994), we ask about the broader, so to speak, societal and
constitutional effects of international institutions. We move beyond issue
area-specific impacts of international institutions and ask further how these
institutions affect the rise of a global order. Our argument builds in part on
early neofunctionalist reasoning about the impacts of European integration
and on some recent studies about the growing relevance of denationalized
governance for the structuring of domestic political space in European states
(Schmitter 1969; Hooghe and Marks 2008; Kriesi et al. 2008). We argue
that internationalized governance has reached a reflexive stage in which
progressively more societal actors pay attention to and reflect on political
order beyond national borders (Zu¨rn 2004, 151). On this view, politicization is not just another variable to be explained: it is a concept that tries to
grasp the institutional dynamics that could lead to fundamental changes
in world politics. Detailed analysis of the politicization of international
institutions is thus not an end in itself.
In this contribution, we explore the drivers of politicization. Our theoretical argument builds on the concept of international authority and integrates
72 MICHAEL ZU¨ R N , MARTIN BINDER AND MATTHIAS ECKER - EHRHARDT
three alternative accounts of the politicization of international institutions,
that is, the national backlash perspective, the resistance to neoliberal dominance perspective, and the capacity perspective. We argue that all of these
competing explanations presuppose the existence and recognition of international authority, but that none of them conceptualizes it sufficiently.
Accordingly, politicization of international institutions occurs to the extent
that those institutions exercise or are expected to exercise political authority.
To the extent that international authority cannot build on sufficient stocks of
legitimacy, politicization will come primarily in the form of resistance. If
international authority is sufficiently legitimated, politicization will come
primarily in the form of increased utilization of international institutions.
In developing these arguments, we proceed in four steps. First, we define
politicization and show a general trend toward the increasing politicization
of international institutions. Second, we discuss different explanations of
politicization and develop our own account. Third, we illustrate our theoretical argument. We provide initial evidence showing that international
institutions exercise authority across a wide range of governance functions
and that, as a general trend, this authority seems most likely to become
the target of politicization. Fourth, we explore promising avenues for future
research by developing conjectures that further elaborate the authority–
politicization nexus."

"sumamrise main points: Jok Madut Jok, 1996-  ‘Information Exchange in the Disaster Zone: Interaction Between Aid Workers and Recipients in South Sudan’, Disasters

Existing strategies of needs assessment are often based on misunderstandings about the cultural, social and economic conditions of war-affected communities.
 For locals, the assessment process can be tiring and frustrating, with benefits only if they give the ""right"" answers to insensitive questions.
participatory data collection gives an appearance of scientific support for their decisions, even in the midst of complicated political, ethical, and organisational issues.						
Relief interventions  in Sudan have frequently been criticised for their lack of social and cultural information which accurately reflects the perspective of the rural people who are suffering the effects of the famine.
Alex de Waal: famines are more than crises in food supply, but are health crises as well → although the knowledge and skills of nutrition and anthropometry are crucial in understanding famines, the skills of the epidemiologist are also required. 
As a reaction to these criticism: they attempted to collect more relevant data by conducting ‘needs assessments’ before initiating food and health programmes.
“assessment fatigue”:the reluctance felt by communities in northern Bahr-el-Ghazal, Sudan, from frequent assessment missions aimed at evaluating food and health need.
Relief workers are expected to recommend which areas in the regions are most affected → and who and how many people actually need help. 
There is a need to have a policy that justifies what emergency food security is for	
There is a  belief that disaster zone populations suffer more from communicable disease than from lack of food, including health status assessments which aim to establish a health profile of communities. 
What the assessments are for
The information is gathered to address criticism that aid is often given without clear needs. If there’s no specific need for food aid (to prevent hunger) or health aid (for disease prevention and healthcare), then aid delivery is seen as ineffective. 
In chronic crises, a “development approach” is essential, encouraging communities to rebuild their livelihoods rather than relying on aid. 
Food security, therefore, should also involve services like veterinary care, clean water, and better healthcare. (de Waal, 1989)
Without a reliable system to ensure food aid reaches those most in need, aid often ends up supporting warring groups instead, who take a portion for themselves. This creates a difficult choice: continue providing food aid, knowing some will be diverted, or risk starving civilians in hopes of pressuring for peace
Local communities often suspect that aid agencies focus more on securing funds and maintaining jobs than on genuinely helping.
The locals are interested in information that they think aid workers can provide them with
Diverging views on information
Misunderstandings often arise in information gathering during relief efforts, due to factors like intentional misinformation or differences in expectations between aid workers and local people.
Assessment Fatigue: People grow tired of constant assessments, especially during busy seasons. Relief agencies often don't track past information, forcing new staff to start from scratch and gather unreliable data.
Unequal Power Relations: Locals may feel powerless and try to outwit aid workers. They may provide misleading answers, particularly if they feel the questions are irrelevant or foolish, like asking Dinka people about cattle numbers, which is culturally inappropriate.
Gender Sensitivity Issues: Relief workers sometimes fail to understand local gender dynamics. For example, women may not speak freely during interviews if men are present, and relief workers often overlook the role of women in the household and community.
Cultural and Social Understanding: Many relief workers lack a deep understanding of local culture and social structures, especially gender relations. This leads to ineffective aid programs and a disempowering effect on the community, particularly women.
Power Imbalance: The presence of relief agencies has shifted local attitudes, with some community leaders inflating population figures to get more aid. This behaviour, though demeaning, is driven by the need for survival in a system that rewards vulnerability.
Long-term Impact: The relief culture can have lasting effects, altering community dynamics and diminishing the ability of people to rely on traditional support networks. As aid continues, local people, especially women, may lose power and dignity, leading to a cycle of dependency.
Information and programme implementation
health relief programs in South Sudan, particularly in the Western Dinka region:
 When international NGOs arrived to conduct nutritional surveys, the local population, especially women and children, expected to receive medical treatment, such as medicine and better healthcare services.  → However, the actual aim of the surveys was to gather information about the community's health status, including diseases, nutrition, and sanitation, not to provide immediate healthcare. 
This caused disappointment, as people hoped for more direct assistance, leading to increased demand for services that the NGOs were unprepared to meet.
Relief workers, on the other hand, often considered the program a success because they saw temporary improvements in some children's nutritional status and the number of people served. → However, many local women felt the health services were inadequate, as they had no chance to discuss their health issues or receive proper treatment. 
There was also resentment due to male health workers' poor treatment of women. → Women faced multiple barriers in accessing healthcare, such as having to rely on male guardians for decision-making, long distances to clinics, and male-dominated healthcare staff who were insensitive to women's reproductive health issues. 
Reproductive health problems, including sexually transmitted diseases, often went unaddressed because of gender biases, cultural taboos, and a lack of understanding of women's health needs.
Conclusion
Many emergency relief programs are criticised for being unsatisfactory. → One major issue is the difference between the perspectives of aid agencies and the local people affected by disasters.
Relief programs often assume that disaster victims are simply starving people, focusing mainly on food delivery. → These programs usually lack clear objectives and measurable outcomes.
Aid agencies focus too much on food aid, neglecting health issues like disease and overcrowding. → Local people's own methods for coping with disasters are overlooked, and the relief effort becomes a temporary fix instead of a long-term solution.
The local economy and people’s livelihoods are not supported properly.


In South Sudan, agencies have conducted needs assessments before launching programs, but these have been problematic.
A major issue is the misunderstanding between aid workers and local people, leading to distrust. →The frequent assessments are seen as unnecessary, and people often provide misleading information because they doubt the intentions of aid workers.
Even though Operation Lifeline Sudan has improved its data collection methods, the focus has been more on gathering data rather than analysing its quality.
The data being used to make policy decisions is still questionable, and the overall effectiveness of the programs is uncertain."

1996). Another test for legitimacy could consist in look-
ing at whether an institution experiences open resistance
or opposition. However, as Scott (1985) has famously
argued, open resistance may be prevented by many fac-
tors. For example, actors may be subject to material
dependency or lack the resources and opportunities to

approach: We examine the level of and grounds for the
Security Council's perceived legitimacy among states,
expressed through the evaluative statements of their repre-
sentatives in UN General Assembly (GA) debates. In mak-
ing such statements, states publicly demonstrate their
acceptance or disapproval of the Council and thus confer
legitimacy on, or withhold legitimacy from, it. Our data which humanitarian interventions require the approval of consist of GA debates over the annual reports submitted the Council. Finally, Johnstone (2003, 2011) and Sand- to it by the Security Council. Such data have thus far not holtz and Stone Sweet (2004) consider the Council to be

tion, scholars who have shaped this literature can be assigned into one of two groups, each holding different assumptions about the Council's degree of legitimacy and what its functions are. The first group argues that states act through the Security Council because it is in a unique position to confer legitimacy to their actions. Claude
(1966:367, 374) describes the Council as a ""dispenser of
granting legitimation. Hurd (2007:17:6) claims that states try to ""associate themselves with the Council as a means to legitimize their actions, decisions and identities."" The legitimacy of the Security Council gives it symbolic power thus making ""its scarce symbolic resources worth fighting over by giving them perceived value"" (Hurd 2002:38).

"rephrase in simpler terms: 
. Approaching the question Candidates who merely focus on providing an overview of different theories of institutions failed to address the question, which asks specifically how they explain compliance in international organisations. By the same token, candidates should not focus on how different theories explain the creation of international organisations, or why states participate in them, but focus on the specific question of compliance (weak candidates simply consider the notions of participation/creation and compliance as synonyms). Good candidates will consider the explanatory logic of the main theories, and ask what it implies for the question why states accept an obligation to comply with rules that are costly. For liberal institutionalism, candidates will focus on the ability of states to enjoy significant benefits of cooperation by accepting certain costly constraints; for constructivism on the perceived legitimacy of institutional rules, and for realism, on enforcement by dominant states. Good candidates will then also explore the explanatory power of these alternative explanations in the case of specific institutions. For example, to probe the liberal institutionalist explanation, candidates could focus on institutions with strong delegated enforcement powers (e.g. the WTO or the EU) and consider whether compliance is better than in institutions without such delegated powers. Excellent candidates would also consider that compliance does not only vary across institutions, but also across states, and how this fits with different theories - for example whether powerful states like the US typically comply less well with institutional rules than weaker states."
"explain briefly: The explanation can be found in all the thinking that we have covered
so far in this course. It has been established that the Sudanese war was a war of marginalisation – which is really just another word for structural violence. The South was for decades, if not centuries, excluded from development. Infrastructure in the South is poor and most resources
are pooled in the North. This was exacerbated by the British-dominated government prior to independence. It was always more difficult for Southerners to get a good education and take up responsible posts because they simply did not have access. This of course meant that with generations of Southerners lacking the necessary education, very few of them were qualified enough to take up leading posts in government and thereby advance Southern development. Things did not change – until one group of Southerners took up violence. The violent war that ensued ultimately led to the peace agreement signed in 2005, but it also cost
the lives of thousands of civilians. In southern Sudan, civilians suffered violence from various armed groups, including the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) who were supposedly fighting for all Southerners. So why was the death toll of civilians so staggering?
Violence against civilians turns our often simplified understanding of a conflict situation on its head. If we accept the standard explanation of the Sudanese conflict, surely all Christian Africans must have been allies of the SPLA? Why then did the SPLA commit atrocities not only against their declared enemies, but also against people who were supposedly like themselves?
There are several explanations and each of them is true. The SPLA often used violence to force support for their fight. They wanted to establish power relations within their own group. They wanted to prove military strength. They wanted to make sure that no civilian would supply the enemy. In some instances too, individuals given the power of command simply abused that power for their own advantage, by looting civilians for their personal gain. The situation is never clear-cut."

Although the report was influential in initiating and helping to shape the policy debate on the informal sector, it came to be criticised over time for its black-and-white definition of informality as unrealistic and fundamentally flawed.
The ILO report was shortly followed by a second influential study, Hart’s (1973) work on informal urban employment in Ghana. Hart focused
on the individual operating in the formal or informal sector, where he characterised wage earners as formal sector, and the self-employed as informal sector. This led to a tripartite classification of the economy, as follows."

"please reprhase in simpler terms through bullet points including in-text citations: Implications for the relationships
between decentralisation and corruption
Decentralisation – particularly its ‘democratic’ form –
has theoretical advantages and disadvantages related
to governance and development, including corruption.
By bringing government ‘closer to the people’,
decentralisation may reduce bureaucracy and increase The first avenue of enquiry is the importance of
the actual functioning of decentralised systems of
governance. The presence of enabling factors for
decentralisation and the coherence of decentralised
systems of governance as actually implemented (the
‘implementation gap’, alluded to earlier) both shape
the real-world effects of decentralised governance on
incentives, functional relationships, and norms. The
second avenue of enquiry is the relationships between
these systems, and collective incentives and social norms.
For example, there is little work exploring the differences
in norms at local levels.competition, increase citizen voice and participation,
and strengthen accountability. These effects are
posited to in turn reduce corruption. At the same time,
decentralisation can threaten coordination, creating
overlapping extractive incentives leading to ‘overgrazing’,
and can overburden low-capacity administrations. In
fact, decentralisation may be associated with more,
or at least more decentralised forms of, corruption,
because institutional hybridity and weak accountability
23
mechanisms are also prevalent at the local level (Booth
and Fritz, 2008). In short:
One might expect a variety of effects associated
with different types of decentralization to operate
simultaneously, pulling in many directions, with
different strength in different contexts. (Fan, Lin,
and Treisman, 2009: 1)
Much of the theoretical literature addressing
decentralisation’s impact on corruption focuses on
the first two (incentive-based) interpretations of both
decentralisation and corruption. The same theoretical
reasons for the desirability of decentralisation in public
economics have also been seen as opportunities for
reducing corruption within a principal–agent framework.
As a result, many studies emphasise the lack or increased
control of subnational agents created by decentralisation
as the key determinant in shaping corruption (Bardhan
and Mookherjee, 2001; for a survey see Shah, 2006). In
fact, the theoretical relationship between decentralisation
and corruption often comes down to these interpretations
of the effect of decentralisation on control over local elites:
In one way it increases political accountability
… to the local people, as the local government
is much nearer to them with a better idea of
the needs of the local people, and the latter can
monitor it much better. But, on the other hand,
it might be easier for the local elite groups or the
oligarchic interests to capture local government
… Clearly, this varies from country to country
and from context to context … but in principle
we have to be wary of this trade-off between more
local information and the possibility of easier
capture. (Bardhan, 2006: 346)
Following this logic, conditional explanations for the
variance in empirical outcomes emerge (see also previous
section on empirical evidence). Where decentralisation
results in multiple tiers of government or overlapping
authorities, corruption is more likely (Treisman, 2007a;
Fan, Lin and Treisman, 2009; Tanzi, 1995; Carbonara,
2000). Where information is more readily available,
principal–agent dynamics are reduced and corruption less
likely. In short, decentralisation’s ‘welfare comparison with
centralisation depends upon the extent of local capture’
(Bardhan and Mookherjee, 2001: 17). Other factors can
be extrapolated from this logic – for example mobility
reduces the negative effects of independent decentralised
state monopolies that foster excessive bribe-taking (Shah,
2006: 10; Prud’Homme, 1995).
By the same logic, accountability is the key to reducing
the impact of elite capture and therefore corruption in
decentralised contexts. In this light, the existence of strong
media, rule of law or citizen participation is argued to be
positive, as is devolution instead of deconcentration (Shah,
2006; Crook and Manor, 1998). Similarly, alignment of
expenditure and revenue decentralisation is posited as
a good thing, with local taxes and user fees modelled
to generate greater accountability than central grants
(Bardhan and Mookherjee, 2001: 22). On the other hand,
highly costly political competition can generate its own
corruption industry, and to erode distinctions between
political and petty corruption (Wardle, 2016).
These latter arguments begin to approximate a
systems approach to understanding both decentralisation
and corruption, adding to the principal–agent model
a need to understand the ‘industrial organisation’ of
corruption, the structure of political competition and
the presence or absence of various enabling factors
for effective decentralisation. Echoing this plural
approach, ‘both principal–agent and collective action
lenses highlight different challenges to anti-corruption’
(Marquette and Peiffer, 2015: 7).
Nevertheless, as Table 6 shows, these arguments cover
a limited amount of the theoretical space available to
explore the relationship (in Table 6, the area shaded pale
yellow). Two large avenues of enquiry connecting the
two concepts of decentralisation and corruption remain
relatively unexplored, and are illustrated in the areas of
the table shaded pale green."
"please provide an extensive summary through key points: The papers in this volume communicate the rich variety of decentral-ization experiences across different countries. In this chapter, we clas-sify these into a few types in terms of both context and design andthen explore the different designs in terms of the contexts and politicalmotivation.Classifying by context, the type A decentralization experienced byBolivia and Indonesia involved devolution of both political and eco-nomic authority to a substantive degree in a uniform fashion. The typeB decentralization experienced by Brazil and India represented a uni-form political devolution but an uneven economic devolution that hasbeen diffusing slowly through a heterogeneous set of regional contexts.In contrast to these two types, which correspond to the spread anddeepening of democracy in the broad sense of encouraging popularparticipation and accountability of elected governments, the type Cdecentralization experienced in Pakistan, Uganda, and China corre-44Pranab Bardhan and Dilip Mookherjee
sponds to consolidation of nondemocratic power at the national level.The experiences of Pakistan and Uganda over the past decades clearlyillustrate how decentralization has been an instrument used by mili-tary governments to preempt regional or ethnically based political op-positions. Hence there is no general presumption that decentralizationand democracy (broadly defined) go hand in hand. In type C kindsof decentralization, administrative and economic decentralization hasbeen more significant. Of all countries, the Chinese case involves themost far-reaching role of local governments in development of localproductive enterprises.Finally, South Africa represents a transition from a type C to a typeA decentralization as part of the transition out of the apartheid regimebeginning in 1994.The designs of the decentralizations were related to the historicaland political contexts within which they arose. Types A and B corre-spond to countries that are democratic at the national level. Here de-centralization has corresponded to greater political devolution to a setof local governments with independent constitutional authority andthus to a widening of the scope of democracy from national to locallevels. Some of these were a natural part of a transition to democracy,as in Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa. Others occurred within thecontext of an ongoing democracy, such as Bolivia and India. Whetherthe decentralization has been comprehensive and uniform (type A) orpiecemeal, gradual, and uneven (type B) seems to be related to the bal-ance of power between regional powers and the national governmentat the time the decentralization was initiated. If regional governmentsor elites exerted significant power, they had significant room and abil-ity to control the process within their respective regions, resulting in atype B pattern.4What motivated national governments to voluntarily relinquish theirown authority to local governments? In some cases (Brazil, Indonesia,and South Africa), decentralization formed part of a transition from anondemocracy to a democracy in the society at large, hence represent-ing a natural diffusion of power over political and economic decisions.In ongoing democracies such as Bolivia and India, they occurred asincumbents at the national level faced challenges to their own author-ity from rising regional powers and other political parties. They soughtto restore some of their own credibility in the wake of the disappoint-ing performance of the previous centralized mode of governance andto cultivate new channels of patronage to counter the threat fromThe Rise of Local Governments45
new adversaries. Finally, type C decentralizations represented a wayof consolidating the power of the national government: little politicalauthority has been devolved, and the main purpose has been to im-prove economic incentives or administrative efficiency.Some common features recur across different kinds of decentral-ization, with regard to the nature of economic and administrativedevolution. Responsibilities transferred have consisted primarily of ad-ministration of local infrastructure, welfare, and social services. Finan-cial devolution has been largely conspicuous by its absence, with mostlocal governments relying overwhelmingly on fiscal transfers fromhigher-level governments. Hard rather than soft budget-constraintproblems dominate. This is in contrast to fiscal decentralization to re-gional, provincial, or state governments in various developing coun-tries (see, e.g., the studies in Rodden, Eskeland, and Litvack, 2003).Decentralization to local governments has not tended to increase theoverall scale of government spending or to allow much flexibility withrespect to variation in the scale of local need. In this aspect of respon-siveness, there was probably little improvement (or cause for concern)relative to more centralized governance modes.Regarding impact of the decentralizations on other dimensions ofresponsiveness, such as interregional equity (or intercommunity tar-geting), type A decentralizations appear to have achieved significantimprovement. The evidence is not so clear for the other types of decen-tralization. This is explained by the combination of the following twofacts. First, the general lack of local autonomy over revenue risingimplies that the scale of resources available to local governments hasbeen determined primarily by fiscal transfers received from higher-level governments. Second, in a type A decentralization that is man-dated by a nationally uniform, comprehensive reform linking thenational government with local governments that have independentconstitutional authority, fiscal transfers tend to be determined by trans-parent formulas incorporating demographic size and needs. Comparedwith previous patterns of interregional resource transfers reflecting po-litical discretion or negotiation, this results in considerable improve-ment in interregional equity. This was particularly evident in the caseof Bolivia and seems also to have been the experience of Indonesia andSouth Africa. It seems likely that type B decentralizations (Brazil orIndia) will encounter less improvement with regard to interregionalequity because of their inherent unevenness. This was highlighted in46Pranab Bardhan and Dilip Mookherjee
the evidence for the Indian state of West Bengal. Type C decen-tralizations are characterized by continuing control by the nationalgovernment, so fiscal transfers could still be dominated by politicaldiscretion. The Chinese experience seems consistent with this inter-pretation: decentralization has not resulted in any noticeable improve-ment in interregional equity and has probably exacerbated previousinequalities. Nevertheless, confirmation of the hypothesis that type Adecentralizations dominate the others with regard to their success inintercommunity targeting will have to await more detailed empiricalevidence.Type A decentralizations that devolve political and economic powerevenly tend also to promote responsiveness with regard to local pref-erences over composition of local public spending. Here the onlyevidence available is from Bolivia, where there were striking composi-tional shifts in accordance with local needs.Impacts on intracommunity targeting are more difficult to identify,owing to lack of suitable data at the micro household level. These arealso subject to econometric problems of identification and have tendedto be located in regions where the decentralization was more thor-oughly implemented than others. So it is difficult to draw any generalconclusions. In the few contexts where intracommunity targetingassessments have been carried out (such as West Bengal in chapter 6in this volume), the results suggest that local governments are capableof achieving high levels of targeting the poor and responding to theneeds of groups that were traditionally discriminated against (womenand minorities).Where detailed impact assessments were not feasible, the casestudies attempted to appraise whether suitable preconditions for ac-countability improvements from local democracy existed. In this re-spect, there seems to be great heterogeneity. The studies for the moreeconomically backward countries such as India, Pakistan, and Ugandawere quite pessimistic, though the assessment of Bolivia and West Ben-gal were positive. There was also considerable heterogeneity acrossdifferent regions within any given country, especially noticeable in theBrazil, Bolivia, and India studies. These highlight the importance ofmany ancillary institutions not directly included in the design of decen-tralization per se—traditions of political participation and voter aware-ness, citizen oversight groups, external media attention, literacy levels,and the extent of local social and economic equality. The importanceThe Rise of Local Governments47
of these was rendered especially salient in the comparative evaluationof two different municipalities within Bolivia in Faguet’s study.In light of this rich and varied experience, it is difficult to draw anysimple conclusions concerning the general impact of decentralizationon development or the way that decentralizations ought to be de-signed. Both theory and evidence suggest that outcomes are likely tobe sensitive to context and design, in both respects of which there isgreat heterogeneity. The following general hypotheses neverthelesscan be proposed.Type A decentralizations tend to perform better than type B or Cin the dimension of interregional targeting. This aspect is determinedlargely by the formal design of the decentralization.Improvements in accountability (intracommunity targeting, specifi-cally) or popular participation require a functioning democracy at thelocal level, which includes both a formal decentralization design (inde-pendent authority of local governments, direct elections, with politicalparties allowed to participate) as well as ancillary local institutions (atradition of widespread political participation, lack of excessive socialor economic inequality within the community, institutions such as citi-zen councils, NGOs, media or audit accounting mechanisms exercisingoversight over actions of local governments). It is difficult to generalizebeyond this. The effects on this dimension are therefore likely to varygreatly across communities or regions.Most decentralizations have involved hard rather than soft bud-get constraints for local governments: expenditure responsibilities de-volved have tended to outstrip revenues devolved, and independentrevenue-raising powers have not risen much. Hence the decentraliza-tions are unlikely to have much macroeconomic impact; underfundingof required expenditures on local infrastructure or social services hastended to continue. China is the only country where the local govern-ments have played a leading role in increasing rates of growth.The limited evidence available indicates that if properly designedand implemented, decentralization has significant potential for widen-ing political representation and for targeting resources in favor ofthe poor. This is particularly evident for interregional allocations thatmoved in favor of backward regions in Bolivia and South Africa owingto formula-bound schemes of fiscal transfers. These programs replacedthe political discretion of previous centralized administrations that dis-proportionately favored a few narrow, wealthy sets of constituencies.48Pranab Bardhan and Dilip Mookherjee
In parts of Brazil and India where devolution was seriously imple-mented, poor and socially disadvantaged minorities interests werebetter represented.Yet these are perhaps some extreme and unrepresentative cases.Overall, most country experts were more positive about the potentialrather than actual achievements of decentralization in improving gov-ernment performance or reducing poverty. They were most positiveabout the creation of new political space and the opportunities forinnovation in public policy. This suggests that it may be too earlyto pass judgment. Short-run impacts may well differ from long-runimpacts. Even limited forms of decentralization may unleash new po-litical forces that affect the future dynamics of political innovation ascommunities learn from past experience and from each other and aspatterns of political participation respond to devolution"

variety of options. When combined, these result in an open-ended array of combi- nations around which a state might be structured. Because of this diversity, the particular nature of the national security problem differs substantially from state to state. All states are vulnerable to military and environmental threats. Nearly all are open to economic threats, and many also suffer from basic political and soci- etal insecurities. The different components of the state appear vulnerable to differ- ent kinds of threat, which makes national security a problem in many dimensions rather than just a matter of military defence. The idea of the state, its institutions, and even its territory can all be threatened as much by the manipulation of ideas as by the wielding of military power. Since the ideas underpinning the state are themselves subject to evolution, the problem is not only difficult to solve, but may even be hard to specify with any precision. This diversity of states as referent objects for security underpins the argument in the Introduction about the impossi- bility of devising a universal definition for national security. The concept of secu- rity can be mapped in a general sense, but it can only be given specific substance in relation to concrete cases. Ideally, theoretical and case-study work should inform and complement each other."

"simpler terms please: 
& Establish a baseline for assessing performance. This may be in reference to an IO’s original mission, which reflects what states intended when they create the IO. Given that most IO missions expand over time, a baseline may also refer to the mission at a specific point in time. Scholars can narrow ambiguous or contested missions and address the “eye of the beholder” problem by selecting specific objectives or considering performance from the perspective of a key constituency. Establishing a baseline is important because it is only against a particular set of objectives and in the context of a given timeframe that performance can be assessed.
& Specify what indicators will be used to assess performance. The researcher should explicitly link these indicators to the baseline identified in the first stage by explaining how they capture performance results of interest.
& Be clear about the level or levels of analysis that will be examined, and justify this choice. The distinction between process performance and outcome performance provides a starting point, as does the three stages identified in the performance pyramid (Fig. 2): narrow administrative functions, interme- diate goals and outputs, and broad outcomes that contribute directly to problem-solving. In all cases, however, we should be cognizant that these various levels interact with each other and rarely tell the whole story of performance.
& Identify and analyze the sources of good or bad performance and describe the mechanisms by which they shape IOP. We should be open to the possibility that a combination of factors—social and material, internal and external—is driving outcomes."

"""In this model a less-developed country has a source of surplus labour because, at low levels of development, the marginal productivity of labour (MPL) in agriculture is zero, while MPL in industry is higher. So, according to the model less developed countries can therefore transfer labour from agriculture to industry without loss of output in agriculture, and the whole economy gains from this shift in terms of productivity. As the supply of labour to industry is effectively elastic, industry can pay low wages and
be profitable in the initial stages of this shift. Reinvested profits then raise MPL, leading to an increase in demand for industrial labour. This increased demand for industrial labour eventually exhausts the elastic supply of labour from agriculture, and industrial wages rise. Ultimately, in the
Lewis model, development is seen as a process of capital accumulation in industry where development is limited by the availability of surplus labour in agriculture and profits in industry."" how would you summarize this in three sentences?"

Do u know the book how change happens
"can you summarise each point: A range of institutional features can be implemented in order to constrain
the power of the majority, and consensus democracies typically use most
or all of the following:
• A presidential regime (versus a parliamentary regime): A
presidential system separates powers between the executive and the
legislature. This ensures that coalitions have to be built on an issue-
by-issue basis. As we shall see in more detail later in this chapter, the
president cannot force his party to support his policy proposals in the
legislature and this increases the need for compromise with a wider
range of interests in order to earn their support. One such example of
how this was necessary is visible in President Obama’s deficit reduction
plan in late 2011 which he struggled to pass until appeasing interests
from all sides of the political divide.
• Coalition and/or minority government (versus single-
party government): a proportional electoral system increases the
likelihood of coalition government, which forces compromises to be
made within cabinets and within legislatures. In the UK under Tony
Blair, the Labour Party could ‘whip’ Labour MPs to support policy
proposals through a series of carrots and sticks, even if the MPs did
not necessarily agree with all aspects of the proposal. In contrast,
the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government from 2010
onwards requires negotiation and discussion over policy proposals in
order to get support from two parties. Similarly, minority governments
entail compromise in order to get policies passed through the
legislature with opposition support.
• Bicameral legislature (versus unicameral legislature): a bicameral
legislature is a parliament with two chambers, such as a Congress
and a Senate. If these chambers are composed of different groups or
if representatives are chosen in different ways in each chamber, this
ensures that governments need to get support from another body
before getting policies passed. Germany’s parliament is comprised of
two chambers – the lower house is the Bundestag and the upper house
is the Bundesrat.
The Bundestag is elected across the whole country while the Bundesrat
is elected on a regional basis. Therefore, in order to get a bill passed,
the government must win support from a body representing the
national interest as well as a body representing regional interests.
It is worth noting that even though some parliaments, such as the
Westminster parliament, have two chambers, the upper house is
often so weak and powerless that the system effectively operates as a
unicameral democracy.
• Federalism/Decentralisation (versus unitary government): a
federal arrangement restricts the power of central government by
reserving certain policy areas for a regional authority.
• Referendums (versus parliamentary sovereignty): the use of
referendums to decide whether a policy should be implemented or not
constrains the government by placing the power in the hands of the
people directly. In Switzerland there is a strong programme of binding
referendums which the government must follow if enough of the
voters demand that a referendum be held.
• Written constitutions, bills of rights and constitutional
courts (versus parliamentary sovereignty): a written constitution or
a bill of rights enshrines the limits of what policies are acceptable and
Chapter 10: Regime types, agenda-setters and veto players
165
what policies are not. If a policy is passed, it can be challenged in a
court and if an independent judiciary agrees that this contradicts a
country’s constitution or a human rights act, the judiciary can strike
down the legislation and force parliament to redraft or abandon it."

"Briefing Doc: Exploring Epistemic Thinking and Team Dynamics
This briefing doc analyzes three sources, focusing on epistemic thinking and team dynamics.

Source 1: Phillip N. Ellis' dissertation, ""Epistemic Thinking's Role in Collaborating on a Wicked Problem""
Key Themes:
Epistemology and Metacognition: The dissertation delves into the concepts of epistemology (how we know what we know) and metacognition (thinking about thinking), arguing that these are crucial for navigating complex collaborative environments. Ellis emphasizes the need for individuals to become aware of their epistemic thinking to adapt to a dynamic world.
""Fortunately, people can become aware of their epistemic thinking to gain mastery and control over it and arguably create the predisposition to adapt to this increasingly complicated world."" (Ellis, 2022, p.13)
APT-AIR Model: Ellis employs the APT-AIR model, a framework that breaks down epistemic thinking into aims, processes, ideals, adaptation, and regulation. This model helps analyze how individuals approach knowledge acquisition and collaboration.
Epistemic Systems: Recognizing that epistemic norms differ across disciplines and institutions is crucial for understanding collaborative challenges. The dissertation highlights the importance of recognizing diverse epistemic perspectives.
Knowledge as Resource: Moving beyond rigid epistemic belief systems, the dissertation presents the idea of knowledge as a flexible resource that individuals can activate based on the context.
Collaboration and Wicked Problems: Ellis explores how epistemic thinking can be applied to solve ""wicked problems"" - complex challenges with no clear solutions. He argues that understanding individual epistemic approaches can lead to more effective collaborative strategies.
Source 2: Strategic Doing Institute's ""Practitioner's Field Guide""
Key Themes:
Collaborative Action: This guide promotes a practical approach to collaborative work, emphasizing actionable steps and tangible outcomes. Strategic Doing focuses on ""doing more together"" and utilizes simple rules to address complex problems.
Asset-Based Approach: The guide stresses identifying and leveraging existing assets within a collaborative network. It encourages participants to think beyond financial capital and recognize the value of skills, knowledge, and networks.
""Money is an important asset, but there are so many more assets when we think more broadly."" (Strategic Doing Institute, 2019)
Creating Opportunities: By linking and leveraging diverse assets, the guide aims to generate innovative and impactful solutions. It emphasizes the iterative nature of collaboration, highlighting that new assets and opportunities emerge as the network grows.
Pathfinder Projects: The guide advocates for ""learning by doing"" through ""Pathfinder Projects"" - small-scale experiments designed to test assumptions and gather feedback.
Civility and Deep Conversations: Underpinning effective collaboration are principles of civility and respectful dialogue.
""Open, honest, focused, and caring collaboration among diverse participants is the path to accomplishing clear, valuable, shared outcomes."" (Strategic Doing Institute, 2019)
Source 3: Jon R. Katzenbach and Douglas K. Smith's article, ""The Discipline of Teams""
Key Themes:
Defining Teams: The article distinguishes between a group and a team, emphasizing the importance of shared purpose, performance goals, and mutual accountability in creating a high-performing team.
""No group ever becomes a team until it can hold itself accountable as a team."" (Katzenbach & Smith, 1993)
Types of Teams: The authors categorize teams based on their function: teams that recommend things, teams that make or do things, and teams that run things. Each type faces distinct challenges that require specific strategies.
Team Performance: Katzenbach and Smith highlight the critical role of clearly defined goals, individual contributions, and a shared work product in driving team success.
Connecting the Dots:
These sources offer valuable insights into navigating complex collaborative endeavors. By combining the theoretical framework of epistemic thinking with the practical strategies outlined in the ""Practitioner's Field Guide"" and the insights on team dynamics from ""The Discipline of Teams,"" individuals and organizations can enhance their ability to:
Foster understanding and respect for diverse ways of knowing and valuing knowledge within collaborative settings.
Actively identify and leverage a wider range of assets, moving beyond traditional resource models.
Structure collaborative processes that encourage experimentation, learning, and adaptation.
Build high-performing teams by establishing shared purpose, performance goals, and mutual accountability mechanisms.
By integrating these principles, collaborative efforts can move beyond mere cooperation and achieve greater impact in tackling complex challenges.

"Exam preparation schmitt
What is the concept of the political according to Schmitt and why is violence so important to it? Reading for this question The reading for this question is listed in Block 9 of the PS1130 VLE course guide. Approaching the question The essay asks students to look at Schmitt’s international theory, but they will need to show some knowledge of his theory of the state and of the ‘political’ as he calls it. Schmitt’s political theory criticises views that emphasise pluralism and diversity inside the state as this creates disorder and instability – civil war and political violence. That requires a strong state to confront pluralism and this state defines these opponents as ‘enemies’ so the distinction between friends and enemies is crucial to his idea of the state. This definition of enmity as outside the political community then presupposes a world of plural political societies or states. So, the logic of the state is uniformity within but plurality outside. Good candidates will see clear parallels with Hobbes’s view of the state. International relations is irreducibly plural and diverse and therefore conflictual – hence the states’ right to war. But as Schmitt insists that conflict is a violent conflict drawing on a mortal clash of wills and not simply a clash of irreconcilable ideas or interests. Violence is not a by-product of his concept of the political but is an essential constituent of it, hence his emphasis on the state’s right to war as a feature of statehood and the priority of the state’s claim over its people and their interests. 

Why does Schmitt challenge the idea of a liberal global order. Reading for this question The reading for this question is listed in Block 8 of the PS1130 VLE subject guide. Approaching the question This question asks the candidate to identify the problem with liberalism in Schmitt’s view and the way in which this undermines state power and authority. The essay asks students to look at Schmitt’s international theory, but they will need to show some knowledge of his theory of the state and of the ‘political’ as he calls it. Schmitt’s political theory criticises views that emphasise pluralism and diversity inside the state as this creates disorder and instability – civil war and political violence. That requires a strong state to confront pluralism and this state defines these opponents as ‘enemies’ so the distinction between friends and enemies is crucial to his idea of the state. Liberalism seeks to spread diversity and pluralism within the state but then subordinates state power to the global power of capital and commercial society echoing Lenin and Rousseau. Sovereignty is reduced to what is in the commercial interests of a people and these interests are manipulable by economic power and short-term interest. In the face of this peculiar claims of the political are subordinated to economic interests. However, the problem is that this is not merely a short-sighted trade-off but a relationship of subordination and domination as economic interests, particularly the interests of global multinationals have a domestic home and co-opt political power to defend their interests and markets. Echoing Rousseau, Schmitt sees the rise of global economic power as a source of perpetual conflict not order

What is the friend/enemy distinction and why is it so important for Schmitt? Reading for this question • Schmitt, The Concept of the Political. • Schmitt, Writings on War. • Schmitt, The Theory of the Partisan. Approaching the question The primary material for this question is The Concept of The Political but other of Schmitt’s works might also be included and would be appropriate in developing an PS1130 Introduction to international political thought 10 answer to this question. The question has two parts. Firstly, candidates must give an account of the friend/enemy distinction in Schmitt’s political theory. This requires more than a brief description, and good answers offered more nuanced interpretive arguments. This is an important part of the question because whilst Schmitt’s distinction is drastic, it becomes more complicated to understand in the details. Whatever the candidate goes on to say about the importance of the friend/enemy distinction will depend on how they interpret the distinction in the first place. Secondly, candidates need to give an account of why the friend/enemy distinction is so important for Schmitt’s political theory. Nearly all cases will require candidates to consider the direct importance of the friend/enemy distinction for Schmitt’s conception of ‘The Political’. This would be enough for a good answer to this question, but it is also open to candidates to go beyond this and consider the implications of the friend/enemy distinction, along with Schmitt’s account of politics, for his political theory more generally. Examples include Schmitt’s critique of liberalism, his international political theory, and his writings on war. In doing so, it was important for candidates to continue to link their argument back to the friend/enemy distinction and avoid getting into a general and unspecific discussion of, for example, Schmitt’s international political theory. Consideration might also be given to Schmitt’s practical politics and his support of the Nazi regime in particular. This was done both well and poorly in this cohort of answers. When it is done well, it is closely engaged with Schmitt’s theory and not only historical events, whether Schmitt himself participated in them or not. Done well, this can be very productive as it allows further theoretical and interpretive claims to be made about why Schmitt constructs the distinction between friend and enemy as he does, and how he integrates it into his overall political theory. Done poorly, the candidate fails to engage properly with the course material."
"how many words: In this essay I will discuss commonalities between St. Augustine and realist theories. 
St. Augustines perspectives can fit well into classical realism and not into Neorealism, especially because of his view on the flawed human nature being the cause for conflict.  When it comes to his views on Morals and just war, we have to be careful categorizing him as a classical realist theorists, we better look at him as a christian realist. 
I will start by pointing out similarities between St. Augustine's Ideas to classical realism and why Neorealism should not be associated with him. Then I will explain how his perspectives on Just war and ethics makes it difficult to completely align him with classical realism. Last, I will explain why he is best associated with christian Realism. 

St. Augustine's Ideas and perspectives are all routed and explained by the bible. He believes in the fallen world, caused by the original sin that brought evil into the world and made humans and there motives flawed. Now, we life in the city of man where there is evil, suffering and injustice. We life separated from the City of God where there is no evil but peace and justice. 
According to St. Augustine, here in the city of Man, we can never fully do good, can never fully reach justice and peace. (Paul Kelly 2022)
His view on Human nature being inherently bad and flawed, that man is acting self interested with the power they have, is a view shared by classical realism.
This also is the case for leaders of nations, that means also nations are going to act according to there own sometimes bad will. For this reason, classical realists and St. Augustine, share the opinion that the state itself is bad or even evil. But a necessary instance in this fallen world as in brings more peace than it does harm. (Djung 2014)
In this world, there will always be a power struggle and conflict is not avoidable (Bagby 1994). 
Also, St. Augustine rejects ideologies as in this city of Man, we can never archive peace fully, theories and ideologies promising that are wrong. Both points shared by St. Augustine and Classical Realists like Morgentau. (Soendergaard 2008). 
Now let's look at Neorealism. Neorealism (for example by Waltz) is different to classical realism as it looks at the states, not the individual. It also assumes that states act as a rational actor. St. Augustine disagrees, states lead by man, will always fall for the desire to dominate, will fall for unethical desires. 

A aspect about St. Augustine's doctrine that is debated a lot by scholars is his perspective on just war. For him, peace is much more important than justice as real lasting peace can never be achieved in this fallen world and only comes from god. War and violence should only be used if it brings more peace than it takes, the motive should never be motivated by the lust of dominating or revenge. St. Augustine is concerned with the soul of those who have to go to war and use violence but also acknowledges that the responsibility lies in the hands of those who command violence. He acknowledges the necessity of war under certain conditions, namely to defend themselves, to restore peace or to punish evil. But only if it brings more peace. This aspect of his theory does not fit very well into classical realism but is debated by scholars (J.T. Johnson 2017). Elshtain for example focuses a lot on the ethical responsibilities to bring peace and argues for interventionism, that the strong shoudl bring peace because they have the power to do soo, for example in the case of the Iraq war and the US (War against Terror). This argumentation is criticized by Renggre  (2013), he argues that Elshtain selectively uses St. Augustine to justify war, even though he says war is always unjust, just sometimes necessary. Renggre argues that it is dangerous to try to justify wars in that way. Boucher (2014) again aligns with Elshtain, saying that it is important to adjust to the modern times and that war is a moral obligation under certain conditions. 
This whole debate is important to consider when trying to call St. Augustine a classical realist as this debate around morals would not be relevant in classical realism. There, the ones with the power can do what they want. St Augustine acknowledges that and puts it into the following picture, similar to what Thucidides is doing: “The Emperor angrily demanded of him, “How dare you molest the seas?” To which the pirate replied, “How dare you molest the whole world? Because I do it with a small boat, I am called a pirate and a thief. You, with a great navy, molest the world and are called an emperor.” (Augustine, 1972). 
We can tell, St. Augustine is not agreeing with this part of realism, the ones with the power can do what they want, but it is not necessarily right (Paul Kelly 2022, David Boucher, Elshtain 2003).

As Ethics play a role for St. Augustine, we should not associate him with classical realism but with a special kind of realism, later called christian Realism. Niebuhr is one of the most prominent christian realists, he explained the summarized just war debate with a pendulum metaphor. The decision is between pacifism and intervention. The first can lead to wrongdoing by moral inaction, the second can lead to self-righteous aggression. Niebuhr warns about both and advised that yes, morality matters but should be applied pragmatically. This is what christian Realism is about and what St. Augsutine can be associated with best as it is based on his ideas. (Paipais 2021)

In conclusion, we note that we can view St. Augustine as a realist but we have to be careful with what kind of realism we want to associate him with. Modern structural Realism should not be associated with his thoughts as it assumes that States are rational actors. Classical realism can fit very well as both share the perspective on human sinfulness/bad human nature  that will always lead to conflict. 
But both, classic and Neo Realism mostly ignores Moral, which is under certain conditions very important to St. Augustine. We can associate St. AUgustine with realism, precisely with christian Realism after Niebuhr."

1. Summary of the Proposed Project
Social impact organizations often grapple with “wicked problems”––deeply complex challenges that are difficult to define and even harder to solve. These issues demand innovative thinking and strong collaboration skills. However, many social projects rely on volunteers or part-time staff who don’t receive formal training in problem-solving methods or team collaboration. Our project aims to address this gap by offering workshops and a readily accessible “toolbox” that helps volunteers develop two critical skills: (1) collaboration within diverse teams, and (2) creative, “outside-the-box” thinking.
We envision a cost-effective/free, adaptable program that organizations can use to upskill volunteers, even with limited budgets and high turnover of workers. By equipping volunteers with foundational methods for tackling wicked problems, we aspire to boost the impact of social projects and create a lasting benefit for both volunteers and the communities they serve.

2. Problem & Design Challenge
Problem Statement
In the social impact arena, volunteers and part-time staff frequently face intricate, interconnected challenges—so-called wicked problems. These volunteers often lack structured training in two especially relevant areas: team collaboration and creative problem-solving. Given tight budgets and rotating personnel, many organizations struggle to consistently offer high-quality skill-building opportunities.
Design Challenge
We aim to design a workshop series/single and an accompanying “toolbox” that anyone—regardless of experience level—can pick up and use to strengthen collaboration and creative thinking. The workshop would introduce hands-on exercises for tackling real-world problems in a team setting. The toolbox would serve as a guide that organizations can adapt over time and reuse with new cohorts of volunteers. Our hope is that, by improving these two skill areas, volunteers can more effectively address complex social challenges, not just in their current volunteer job but also in future occupations. We are especially aiming for young and inexperienced workers as there is the most space for improvement.



3. Secondary Research & Insights
Initially, we explored broad research on cross-sector collaboration, gamification, and workforce reskilling to identify which competencies are most critical in solving modern, multifaceted problems. As our focus narrowed, we investigated the concept of wicked problems, which scholars like Rittel & Webber (1973) define as issues without definitive solutions, often requiring iterative approaches and collaboration among diverse stakeholders. According to Brown et al. (2010) and Kawa et al. (2021), such problems are on the rise, influenced by globalization and the rapid pace of technological and societal change.
Crucially, we found that many organizations struggle with harnessing diversity for innovation. Deloitte’s research (2016) and Bourke (2016) suggest that cognitively diverse teams are more innovative, yet they often lack practical frameworks to collaborate effectively. This gap is evident not only in large companies but also in smaller social ventures. Several reports (e.g., Woolley et al., 2010; van Knippenberg, 2013; Wang, 2019) highlight that productive collaboration requires deliberate training, mindset shifts, and clear facilitation methods.
The LSX model (Brookings, 2024) was a very big inspiration. It emphasizes that solving wicked problems demands mental agility, openness to other viewpoints, and systematic approaches to gathering insights. We also spoke with individuals who support social impact initiatives, including practitioners experienced in training volunteers. They confirmed that there is a real need for programs that help inexperienced or rotating volunteers develop advanced problem-solving and collaboration skills.

4. Primary Research
To validate these findings, we conducted interviews with:
Staff at a Cultural Center (CCB): They noted the growing complexity of their work and stressed that volunteers rarely receive structured problem-solving support. While they do run bi-annual training sessions, these focus more on operational tasks than on creative collaboration or adaptability.
Social Impact Project Coordinators: Several coordinators observed that volunteers often become discouraged when faced with open-ended problems. They noted that short, immersive skill-building sessions could boost confidence and overall effectiveness.
Experts in the LSX Approach: Conversations with contributors to the LSX model underscored the importance of team diversity and mental agility. They encouraged focusing on practical, scenario-based learning to help volunteers transfer lessons to real challenges.
These interviews confirmed that many volunteers feel underprepared for the unpredictability of social impact work. They also clarified our design direction: a hands-on, replicable workshop and toolbox, tested and refined with actual social projects.

5. Proposed Solution
Workshops
We plan to pilot an interactive session that introduces foundational collaboration techniques or creative thinking exercises. We are thinking about tools like role-playing, brainstorming games, and “instant feedback” checkpoints will help volunteers practice flexible thinking and deliberate teamwork. 
Toolbox
Alongside the workshops, we will develop a concise, user-friendly “toolbox.” This will include checklists, mini-guides, and simple exercises that organizations can deploy well after the formal workshop ends. The intent is for any project coordinator or new volunteer to open the toolbox and quickly adapt an activity or approach to a current challenge.

by the concept of supply and demand for certain types of candidates.
On the one hand, representation is determined by supply-side variables,
which involve factors that might encourage or deter individuals to seek
political offices. For instance, if women believe they will be less effective or
successful in politics than in other careers, this could reduce the supply of
qualified female political candidates.
However, representation is also affected by demand-side variables. Political
recruitment is determined by gatekeepers in the process, such as selectors
within political parties or voters, whose prejudice and idiosyncrasy will
determine the types of candidates that will emerge successful in the
recruitment process. If such gatekeepers believe that women are less
effective campaigners or policy makers, this will reduce the demand for
female politicians.
Supply and demand factors are related to each other: perceived prejudice
among gatekeepers might dissuade certain types of individuals from
pursuing candidacy in the first place. The lack of supply of certain types
of prospective candidates might also create or reinforce existing prejudice
among gatekeepers.
The distinction between supply and demand is important to keep in mind

"Global product division structure
Companies that have many products and lines of business domestically
will typically adopt a product division structure when they move to
operating globally on a large scale. An example is shown in Willcocks
(2021b) Chapter 2, figure 2.3. This shows the structure of the European
Aeronautic Defence and Space company (EADS) at one moment in time.
This is still headquartered in Munich, Germany and Paris, France, and is
the largest European defence contractor and maker of commercial aircraft
(e.g. the airbus).
At EADS each division is largely self-contained and autonomous, with full
responsibility for its own value creation activities. The headquarters (HQ)
is responsible for the overall strategic development and financial control of
the company. Why use this structure?
• Managers using this structure think that the value-creating activities
of each product division should be coordinated by that division
worldwide. The product divisions are too different from one another
in goals, means and products being sold to merit trying to coordinate
activities and effort across the divisions.
• The product divisional structure often evolves as a response to the
coordination difficulties experienced with the international division
and worldwide geographic area structures.

• With this structure, each division can develop enough scale and
core competencies in its product area to achieve economies of scale,
location economies and economies from experience curve effects. Thus
the structure is good at supporting a global standardisation strategy.

"this is our project: 1. Summary of the Proposed Project
Social impact organizations often grapple with “wicked problems”––deeply complex challenges that are difficult to define and even harder to solve. These issues demand innovative thinking and strong collaboration skills. However, many social projects rely on volunteers or part-time staff who don’t receive formal training in problem-solving methods or team collaboration. Our project aims to address this gap by offering workshops and a readily accessible “toolbox” that helps volunteers develop two critical skills: (1) collaboration within diverse teams, and (2) creative, “outside-the-box” thinking.
We envision a cost-effective/free, adaptable program that organizations can use to upskill volunteers, even with limited budgets and high turnover of workers. By equipping volunteers with foundational methods for tackling wicked problems, we aspire to boost the impact of social projects and create a lasting benefit for both volunteers and the communities they serve.

2. Problem & Design Challenge
Problem Statement
In the social impact arena, volunteers and part-time staff frequently face intricate, interconnected challenges—so-called wicked problems. These volunteers often lack structured training in two especially relevant areas: team collaboration and creative problem-solving. Given tight budgets and rotating personnel, many organizations struggle to consistently offer high-quality skill-building opportunities.
Design Challenge
We aim to design a workshop series/single and an accompanying “toolbox” that anyone—regardless of experience level—can pick up and use to strengthen collaboration and creative thinking. The workshop would introduce hands-on exercises for tackling real-world problems in a team setting. The toolbox would serve as a guide that organizations can adapt over time and reuse with new cohorts of volunteers. Our hope is that, by improving these two skill areas, volunteers can more effectively address complex social challenges, not just in their current volunteer job but also in future occupations. We are especially aiming for young and inexperienced workers as there is the most space for improvement.



3. Secondary Research & Insights
Initially, we explored broad research on cross-sector collaboration, gamification, and workforce reskilling to identify which competencies are most critical in solving modern, multifaceted problems. As our focus narrowed, we investigated the concept of wicked problems, which scholars like Rittel & Webber (1973) define as issues without definitive solutions, often requiring iterative approaches and collaboration among diverse stakeholders. According to Brown et al. (2010) and Kawa et al. (2021), such problems are on the rise, influenced by globalization and the rapid pace of technological and societal change.
Crucially, we found that many organizations struggle with harnessing diversity for innovation. Deloitte’s research (2016) and Bourke (2016) suggest that cognitively diverse teams are more innovative, yet they often lack practical frameworks to collaborate effectively. This gap is evident not only in large companies but also in smaller social ventures. Several reports (e.g., Woolley et al., 2010; van Knippenberg, 2013; Wang, 2019) highlight that productive collaboration requires deliberate training, mindset shifts, and clear facilitation methods.
The LSX model (Brookings, 2024) was a very big inspiration. It emphasizes that solving wicked problems demands mental agility, openness to other viewpoints, and systematic approaches to gathering insights. We also spoke with individuals who support social impact initiatives, including practitioners experienced in training volunteers. They confirmed that there is a real need for programs that help inexperienced or rotating volunteers develop advanced problem-solving and collaboration skills.

September 2024

Summary

Learning at “Forward College has a strong collective dimension as the quality of the flipped classroom depends significantly on students’ contribution. This is why it is essential for students’ overall performance to attend classes regularly.

Therefore, students are required to justify all their absences, using the form available on the student portal. Additionally, students can claim 2 Self justified absences each term for minor illnesses or personal matters, provided they do not conflict with key academic deadlines and events. Attendance is recorded by Fellows and monitored by Personal Tutors. 

Any unjustified absence will impact the attendance grade that accounts for 20% of the Forward grade, along with Performance (40%) and Engagement (40%). As a reminder, if the Forward Grade grade drops below 45%, or if a student accrues 10 unjustified absences in a single term, the Personal Tutor will contact the student and they might be placed on Provisional Status by the Teaching and Learning Coordinator. 

The following document regulates attendance at Forward College in detail. 
Please note that the policy on Termination of Registration on Academic Grounds remains unaffected and might apply in parallel to this policy.  

Please also note that serious breaches of Forward College regulations, our Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, or any reported cases of misconduct - such as false statements or falsification of documents - may be subject to disciplinary procedures, outlined in our Disciplinary Policy and Procedure for Students.

What Counts as an Absence?
‘Absence’ refers to any non-attendance of a student from a class with mandatory attendance. This includes, but is not limited to, seminars, revision sessions in Years 1 and 2, revision period in Year 1, mandatory Personal Tutoring meetings, Personal Development and Project-Based Learning classes (including workshops and team debriefings), presentations, or language course classes.
Absences can be excused or unexcused. Only unexcused absences can have adverse consequences. 

Justifying Absences

Students need to submit justifications for all of their absences. The relevant form can be found on the Digital Campus or by contacting your Campus Management Administrator. All matters relating to the justification of absences are handled by the Campus Administrator. 
Students must follow the procedure on the student portal for each campus. Absences can be excused for the following reasons (wherever possible, notification should be given in advance):

Medical appointments/illness;
Important administrative appointments (passport, visa, etc.) that cannot be held outside of teaching hours;
Important immediate family commitments such as funerals or  weddings;
Important religious holidays recognised by the campus’ local government in addition to bank holidays.
Events (conferences, workshops, etc.) at which students represent Forward College in an official capacity.
All written justifications for absences (e.g., medical certificates) need to be submitted to the Campus Administrator no later than 7 days after the absence occurred. Justifications and reasons for absences remain fully confidential.



Special Procedures of Justification:

In addition to the procedure outlined above, students might request a justified absence due to wellbeing related matters or a ‘Self Justified Absence’.

Absences due to wellbeing issues can be excused on the basis of a message sent by the Wellbeing Coordinator to the Campus Administrator, no later than 7 days after the absence. It is a student’s responsibility to reach out to the Wellbeing Coordinator in good time to request them to issue the justification.

Students may request up to two ‘Self Justified Absence’ (SJA) absences per term on the condition that they do not impact Formative Assessments, regular student presentations, final project presentations, or other major deadlines/events. Such absences may be used to attend events, for minor illness not requiring medical attention, etc. An SJA might imply missing multiple classes over several days.  For absences lasting three days or longer, a medical certificate must be provided. SJA must be submitted through the dedicated form for absences (see above).  

In all cases of absence students should inform their tutor/fellow as well as the peers they work with about their absence. 
Should a student have personal issues or concerns that prevent them from regularly attending classes, group meetings, and events, and would like to discuss them in confidence, they are encouraged to contact their Personal Tutor who may reach out to the Teaching and Learning Coordinator or campus Wellbeing Coordinator for special arrangements. 

Lateness to Classes
Being more than 10 minutes late for a class will be recorded as an absence and the student may not be allowed to join the class. If the student is absent or more than 10 minutes late, they will need to submit a justification of absence to the Campus Administrator. If they fail to provide an adequate justification within 7 days, they will receive an unjustified absence and their attendance grade will be affected.  


Consequences of Unjustified Absences
Unjustified absences will negatively impact a student’s Forward Grade and, if they exceed a certain number, trigger provisional status. In extreme cases, a high number of unjustified absences can result in preventing the student from taking the UoL exam. These consequences are further explained below.
Please note that the policy on Termination of Registration on Academic Grounds remains unaffected and might apply in parallel to this policy.  

Please also note that cases of misconduct - such as false statements of falsification of documents - may be subject to disciplinary procedures, outlined in our Disciplinary Policy and Procedure for Students.


The Forward Grade:

The College has developed an overall measure of attendance, engagement and performance, named the ‘Forward Grade’. The Forward Grade is found on the student Student Information System (SIS).

Attendance accounts for 20% of the Forward Grade. It is 100% to begin with; each unexcused absence will reduce this by 10 percentage points.

If the Forward Grade drops below 45%, Personal Tutors will ask the student to develop a recovery plan to address the situation and the Teaching and Learning Coordinator might formally place the student on provisional status. The written plan must be submitted to the Personal Tutor and the Teaching and Learning Coordinator. If a student fails to cooperate and/or continues to fail to address the problem, the Teaching and Learning Coordinator can recommend to the Chief Academic Officer/Academic Lead that the student should be prevented from taking end-of-year exams. The final decision on these matters rests with the Chief Academic Officer/Academic Lead and the University of London.

Further Consequences of Unjustified Absences:
In addition to a decrease in the attendance grade, Personal Tutors will reach out to students who have accrued 8 unjustified absences per term.
In such cases, Personal Tutors will ask the student to commit to addressing the situation, and can provide advice on time- and workload-management.
After this stage, if a student accumulates two further unjustified absences in the current term (i.e., 10 unjustified absences in total), the student might be formally placed on provisional status by the Teaching and Learning Coordinator. 
If a student continues to fail to address the problem of repeated absences after this stage, the Teaching and Learning Coordinator can recommend to the Chief Academic Officer/Academic Lead that they should be prevented from taking end-of-year exams. The final decision on these matters rests with the Chief Academic Officer/Academic Lead and the University of London.

Hybrid and Remote Attendance

In-person attendance of lectures, seminars, formative assessments, or tutorials is required. Online or remote attendance is not an option. Students are encouraged to reach out to their Fellow and peers to catch up on any in-class activities they may have missed. The only foreseeable circumstances in which online participation is an option is for visa or serious health issues, and by prior agreement with the relevant Fellow. 

Please note that, in case of absence for personal or medical reasons, even where an absence is ‘justified’ online attendance is not an option for seminars.

"can you evaluate the following: Research Findings
Based on our initial assumptions, we believed the lack of community stemmed from loneliness. To explore this, we conducted secondary research on loneliness among the elderly and youth in Lisbon, using data from academic studies, reports, and organisational insights. However, this assumption evolved as research progressed. Our research examined statistical data, cultural nuances, and community initiatives. While it provided a broad overview, it was not Lisbon-specific and focused more on intergenerational connections between elders and children, rather than adolescents. 
Loneliness among Lisbon's youth is a significant concern, with 20–30% of individuals aged 18–24 reporting feelings of isolation (EU, 2023). Factors contributing to this include overuse of technology, which fosters unrealistic comparisons and fear of missing out, urbanisation-driven displacement of families to the suburbs, and academic and employment pressures that exacerbate stress. When looking at loneliness among Lisbon' elders, it is linked to reduced family interaction due to smaller households and emigration of younger generations. Furthermore, issues include mobility barriers posed by Lisbon’s hilly streets, tourism-focused urbanisation, and cultural disconnection stemming from limited engagement with technology. Studies highlight that loneliness correlates with reduced quality of life (Karger, 2021).
Existing initiatives addressing loneliness provide valuable insights. For example,  GER-AÇÕES fosters intergenerational solidarity through community labs, Pedalar Sem Idade connects elderly residents with youth through cycling activities, and Meo’s Partilha Casa promotes housing solutions that bridge generational gaps. These programs demonstrate the potential of intergenerational engagement to reduce loneliness and build community resilience (World Cities Culture Forum, n.d). Looking at GER-AÇÕES, an organisation that aims to address the same issue as our team. Notably overcoming the initial resistance to participation, which could teach us on how the people in Lisbon function on a cultural and social aspect. Bridging the generational gap is also a pertinent challenge which they face, seeing how such organisations navigate these challenges would serve as a source of inspiration for our project. 
Recognising the inability of the secondary research to identify shared interest between elders and youth, we reconsidered our approach to primary research. We visited Pedro at Dona Ajuda, who introduced us to various initiatives. Volunteering at Dona Ajuda emerged as an essential social meeting space for many elderly individuals, providing structure and purpose that are often lost after retirement. During discussions, we explored ideas for fostering a sense of community by connecting youth and elderly through the NGO. Pedro expressed openness to collaboration, making Dona Ajuda a vital potential stakeholder for its deep ties to the community.
We interviewed Ana Maria, a psychology professor at Forward College, who discussed the benefits of similar projects involving children and elders, which have successfully boosted self-esteem in both groups. However, bridging the gap between adolescents and elders is challenging, as adolescents often focus on themselves and struggle to see the value in what elders offer. Ana Maria suggested that finding common ground, where both groups can contribute meaningfully and give value, is key. She emphasised the importance of involving and empathising with all participants to create a meaningful impact in Lisbon’s community: “It’s not a project that’s made to look good; it’s a project to make the people involved feel good.”
We met with Raquel from the Aga Khan Foundation, who has extensive experience in community-building projects, particularly in underserved neighborhoods. She mentioned the often-overlooked history of Lisbon’s slums, neighborhoods with strong sense of connection throughout the community, and how these communities were relocated to social housing, breaking up the community. This history is largely unknown to younger generations, contributing to a disconnect and lack of mutual understanding between youth and elders. Raquel also introduced us to Associação Per 11, located on the outskirts of Lisbon. Our visit to Per 11 in Santa Clara, managed by Mauro Wah, reinforced these insights as we saw how both youth and elders actively participated in communal projects. It exemplified the intergenerational engagement Raquel had mentioned—how such initiatives can thrive in small, close-knit communities. 
Furthermore, we conducted interviews with four elderly individuals in Benfica, asking about loneliness in Lisbon and their interest in participating in our project. These interviews challenged our initial assumptions. For example, while we initially believed loneliness stemmed from a lack of connection between youth and the elderly, one interviewee shared that they saw loneliness as a lack of personal engagement. This feedback prompted us to rethink certain elements of our project to better align with the diverse experiences of the elderly. To gather more data on the elderly perspective, we reached out to the Senior University (UITI) and are awaiting a response.

When we conducted primary research, we noticed differences compared to our secondary research. Unless explicitly asked, few of our stakeholders referred to loneliness as the main holdback of sense of community. Loneliness was instead a symptom of deeper rooted issues. Thus, our scope shifted towards investigating these problems we did not predict. Firstly, elders losing the social place of work means they have to make a continuous effort to socialise. This can result in loneliness, but does not necessarily guarantee it. Thus, the elderly are in need of opportunities gather. We also noticed a general shift away from closed-knit communities, with less intergenerational homes and the splitting up of Lisbon’s old slums. Considering these insights, our design challenge was reframed from focusing mainly on how to decrease loneliness, to moving towards “re”-building a sense of community.
Both Ana Maria and Mauro spoke about the importance of finding a shared interest to unite elders and youth. Shared activities provide youth and elderly with purpose and a chance to learn from each other, where both groups gain and contribute. Ana Maria emphasised the psychological background for a mutually beneficial connection; both group’s needs must be met. Youth need to be in control of the process, keeping their independence intact, to be engaged. Another insight is that youth like to create, and elders like to share experiences - two different interests that can be well combined.
Furthermore, localised approaches are essential, giving the unique dynamics of different communities. Community-centred issues in some neighborhoods are rooted in lack of opportunity for natural meeting places, while elderly-dense areas like Alfama, require solutions tailored to mobility and accessibility. Participatory engagements stand out as a central theme, from elders having to make the choice of being social, to co-designing approaches ensuring that solutions resonate with and are embraced by both target groups. 
In conclusion, these insights prompted us to shift our focus toward the communal dimension. This perspective highlights the relevance of an intergenerational project, which serves as a means to blend the experience of older generations with the energy of younger ones. By fostering close collaboration with target groups and stakeholders with knowledge of the specific neighborhoods, the initiative can remain deeply rooted in the community, ensuring relevance and sustainability."

"What are the two main theoretical approaches in political science, and how do they differ?
There are two main theoretical approaches to political science. The rational choice approach assumes that political actors act rationally in the sense that they will stick to their predictable preferences when faced with a political choice. This approach has enabled many different insights, an example being the ‘prisoner's dilemma’. This shows the difficulties political actors encounter when having to make a choice, as their choice, depending on other actors, can have different outcomes. While this theory traditionally assumes that political actors should behave rationally, modern day rational choice theorists use it more as a tool to assess what would happen if political actors behave rationally. The Institutional approach includes the role of formal and informal institutions which restrict actors behaviour in political situations. “Informal institutions come into play when the formal institutions give out”(Peng, Wang and Yiang 2008) The formal institu"

What is the role of war in Rousseau’s theory of international politics?

Conduct of War
war= a result of an corrupt society

This question invites candidates to explore the problem and conduct of war in Rousseau’s political theory. Once again candidates can approach the answer from a number of perspectives. Firstly, Rousseau explores the problem of modern war as a consequence of the state system. His discussion of war and of perpetual peace suggests that it arises from the construction of the state system as a series of sovereign states in competition all of which have a motive to seek advantage against the other. Perceptive students will have compared and contrasted his argument with that of Hobbes, where the state is the solution to the problem of war. The second perspective is provided by his account of social contract and the conditions of the general will. When Rousseau turns to the conditions of freedom under the general will he addresses the problem of international politics. The key issue is the challenges of conflict and the extent to which international trade rather than creating conditions of cooperation does the reverse and weakens the power of the state to stand in solidarity against external threats. Candidates combined both 1 and 2 to explore the way in which simplification and a turn away from international affairs is important to ensure peace and stability. Rousseau’s argument is that peace results from disengagement. Finally, Rousseau also explores the way in which states, especially smaller states, might protect themselves against large states by adopting military strategies such as partisan warfare – ideas that were to be taken up by later thinkers such as Mao and Schmitt. The question allowed candidates to pursue any of these lines and different students pursued different lines of argument. The best answers combined a good knowledge of the specific texts with an engagement with larger issues – the best candidates explored whether Rousseau is also a theorist of realism.

Explain and assess Rousseau’s critique of commercial society.

 Approaching the question There are two main ways of addressing this question on Rousseau. The first might focus on the way in which civil society corrupts our natures and creates the conditions of inequality and the rise of amour-propre. The focus of here is on the problem the origins of social conflict and war that Hobbes had taken to be part of the state of nature, but which Rousseau argues is a consequence of civil society. Trade, luxury and jealousy are the primary concepts here and form part of Rousseau’s view of the corrupting nature of commercial society and international trade. The second, although related issue, arises in the circumstances necessary to sustain a general will. Again, Rousseau saw the idea of trade and commercial society as a threat to political or citizen equality. However, he also saw the threat as one arising from the influence of external forces such as those based on relations of trade which pull against the relationships that sustain a political community of equals. Candidates might see Rousseau’s argument as an early example of the dispute between national political economies and the idea of globalisation or open trade and borders that still affects modern international politics

Asses rousseau's claim that an individual can be forced to be free

The focus of this question is Rousseau’s claim in The Social Contract that an individual can be forced to be free.  The most important material for answering this question is therefore the relevant passages of The Social Contract concerning the nature of freedom, both natural freedom and civil freedom, the republic, sovereignty, citizenship, law, and the general will. Discussion of some of these passages is necessary to answer to the question properly. Nonetheless, there is also a wider range of material that can be drawn on so long as this is linked back to the passage on forcing to be free and the main ideas behind it. This could include both passages from the rest of The Social Contract as well as passages from The State of War and A Discourse on the Origins of Inequality. In the latter, perhaps most relevant are how Rousseau understands freedom in the state of nature and the so-called ‘evil contract’ created in Part 2 of that book. This question attracted an average number of answers, including some of the very best among the cohort. The question, however, also produced many answers of a low average quality, a good number of which were the result of the same flaw. To achieve good marks or better on this question, candidates needed to directly address the claim in the question, that according to Rousseau an individual may be forced to be free and assess it. To assess it, candidates needed to take a position on the claim, whatever position that may be, and then argue directly and in detail for this position. General accounts of Rousseau’s political theory can only score so highly. A more argumentative essay is required for better marks. In terms of the form that assessment could take, there are numerous approaches open to candidates, and I will comment briefly on three here. One approach which was touched on by some candidates is to assess directly the apparent contradiction in the claim. To many the contradiction between force and freedom is intuitive, but more importantly it appears to be a contradiction on Rousseau’s own terms given how he sets out the problem The Social Contract seeks to address in the early chapters of that work. One could assess Rousseau in either way. One could assess whether the claim can be rendered coherent (or not) relative to relevant intuitive conception of freedom (and force) or else assess whether Rousseau’s political theory in internally coherent on its own terms. PS1130 Introduction to international political thought 8 Many candidates took a different approach, just as legitimate as a way to answer the question, by assessing whether the claim means Rousseau’s political theory is totalitarian or could be used to legitimate totalitarian rule. This approach led to some of the very best answers in this cohort where candidates drew on appropriate secondary literature and through careful argument concluded, for the most part, that Rousseau’s claim is at the very least open to abuse by connecting force, apparently by the state, with freedom. Finally, another line of assessment drew on Rousseau’s international theory, especially, the impact of international society on the claim through the threats of cosmopolitan culture and commerce, and in this way argued that Rousseau’s claim either has a limited scope and can only apply in small, closed societies, or that it has been outdated.

Hobbes

In what ways does Hobbes’s theory of the state of nature differ from that of states in the international system? 

Approaching the question The question asks candidates to explore the ways in which Hobbes’ account of the state of nature serves as a model for international relations and whether these ‘Hobbes type models’ used by thinkers such as Ken Waltz are actually true to Hobbes’s argument. Candidates need to give a clear analysis and description of Hobbes’s theory of the state of nature. They should be able to identify its central elements and methodological individualism – egoism, scarcity, glory-seeking, diffidence, and natural equality. For the rationalist realists such as Waltz the state of nature is a situation of anarchy or the absence of a hierarchical authority. It is this feature that lends itself to ‘structural realism’. However, Hobbes uses the state of nature to explain the need for sovereignty and the modern state. Individuals in a state of nature would have an overriding reason to leave it and establish a state. This does not seem to be the case for contemporary structural realists. So how far does Hobbes think his state of nature is a description of the international realm? There are passages where Hobbes does suggest that the attitude of princes one to another is like that of individuals in the state of nature. However, Hobbes also acknowledges that there are aspects of international cooperation such as trade (the ius gentium) which obtain even without an overarching international sovereign. Once again there is no simple right answer, and the best essays showed a nuanced understanding of the different views one can take about the applicability of Hobbes’s argument to international politics.

Why for Hobbes is there no global state or sovereign? 

Approaching the question Examiners’ commentaries 2023 5 The question asks candidates to explain why if Hobbes’ account of the state of nature serves as a model for international relations this doesn’t also result in a global state? Candidates need to give a clear analysis and description of Hobbes’s theory of the state of nature. They should be able to identify its central elements and methodological individualism – egoism, scarcity, glory-seeking, diffidence, and natural equality. For the rationalist realists such as Waltz the state of nature is a situation of anarchy or the absence of a hierarchical authority. It is this feature that lends itself to ‘structural realism’.

Once again there is no simple right answer, and the best essays showed a nuanced understanding of the different views one can take about the applicability of Hobbes’s argument to international politics.


Asses the claim that the hobessian sovereign garantuees peace

Approaching the question This question in many ways cuts to the core of Hobbes’ political theory. The appropriate passages of Leviathan for discussion are thus primarily his account of the state of nature and the social contract, although other passages such as those on human nature, the commonwealth, and the international realm are all also worthy of discussion. Perhaps because of its directness in addressing the core of Hobbes’ political theory, this question attracted a lot of answers. For most part, candidate’s accurately discussed Hobbes’ account of the state of nature and the social contract, albeit with some notable inaccuracies occurring fairly frequently, such as the claim that social contract is agreed with the sovereign (it is not) and the failure to distinguish Hobbes’ contractual justification for sovereignty from the divine right of kings. Whilst candidates were for the most part able to give very good and detailed descriptive accounts of the main moves in Hobbes’ argument, as well as of different accounts which apply Hobbes to International Relations theory, the question requires candidate’s to ‘assess’ and, specifically, to assess the ‘Hobbesian sovereign’. Candidate’s failing to address both these parts of the question led to two ways otherwise good essays fell short. First, candidates might provide a detailed account of Hobbes’ arguments but fail to assess those arguments. Second, candidates might assess the general idea that a (absolute) sovereign might guarantee peace but fail to engage in detail with Hobbes’ own particular version of this claim. There are a huge variety of ways the claim might be assessed, but there are two worth highlighting in the context of this module. First, candidates might assess Hobbes’ state of nature and social contract argument at a domestic level where not only absolute answers – yes or no – are possible, but also more nuanced answers – such as the sovereign mitigating the threat of war but not eliminating it – which often yielded strong arguments and answers. One advantage of restricting the discussion to the domestic level was that it kept the focus narrower and allowed candidates to develop more detailed arguments. Second, many candidates considered the difference between domestic and international peace. When this is done well clear contrasts, as well as similarities, between the state of nature and international politics in Hobbes are drawn – for example, lack of equality between states or the existence of industry thanks to the existence of domestic sovereignty – whereas weaker essays relied more on analogies between Hobbes and contemporary IR realism that were not fully argued Examiners’ commentaries 2024 7 for. One point to note is that arguments were more persuasive and answers received higher marks when the claim that Hobbes’ argument is successful at the domestic level, even if it is not at the international level, was defended rather than asserted so that the a"
"Regional integration enforces an institutional framework, which diminishes opportunistic behaviour, which lowers transaction costs which is beneficial for international trade. (Peng & Meyer, 2019) They do this by decreasing trade barriers by unifying formal rules. There are multiple types of regional integration, each advancing cooperation on a deeper level. A free trade area, such as NAFTA, removes all barriers to the trade of goods and services among member countries. A customs union, like the Andean Pact & Mercosur, eliminates the trade barriers between member states and adopts the same policy towards non member states. A common market, as seen in the European Union, allows free movement of the factors of production, goods and people. An economic union implements harmonisation of monetary and fiscal policies. The EU is an imperfect example of this as demonstrated by member countries adopting a common currency. Lastly, a political union, exemplified by the UK, coordinates economic, social and foreign policy between member states.

00:00:00	and the next keynote speaker up on stage those of you who were here this morning you've already met him it's the ideas man who likes to call himself the invisible facilitator for many years this man has been in the front line of innovation policy as a pioneer thinker author and advisor he's also been involved in research in policy making and shaping the way that UK does social innovation don't miss his recent book which is called social innovation how societies find the power to change so let's hear this Nestor's

00:00:39	reflection on the development of social innovation from the past and all the way into future scenarios please welcome Jeff mugger so I meant to dance yeah you don't want to see me dancing I promise you that so well thank you for the invitation to be here I first came to Malmo I realized just over 20 years ago and at that point it was actually quite cold and wet here but it seemed like a good same place but quite normal now it's very weird coming to a discussion like this because you seem so sane

00:01:33	compared to where I'm coming from a country and a protracted nervous breakdown which we just Envy so much the sort of you are saying aren't you the people in this room I think you are yes this is this is in some ways you are the model good society and I say that because probably an event like this even five years ago would have had someone perhaps from Silicon Valley talking about disruption talking about move fast and break things and the weird thing is we've actually been having leaders acting on that advice in recent years

00:02:10	and it's not a very pretty sight and I think we almost need you kind of metaphor of what our kind of innovation isn't for me it's it's something like this it is all about how we collaborate both to deal with threats like those big fish you see they're trying to eat the little fish how we cooperate how we coordinate how we become and I'll talk about this a bit later more like a true collective intelligence like those fish do rather well and that's a very different image from disruption smashing and so on

00:02:42	although a little bit of that is sometimes necessary I'm going to say a little bit about what's in this book which comes out next week I think which is an attempt to bring together a lot of my practical experience I've been involved in setting up a lot of organizations very practical social innovation but also as you said some research and policy so both the top-down and the bottom-up and I was asked to say a little bit about past present and future and so I looked at a thing which we which I was

00:03:16	involved with some colleagues in publishing nearly 15 years ago which was trying to get the innovation world interested in this space and so we called it social Silicon Valley's because we thought that would get people's attention and it was meant to be a manifesto for why innovation shouldn't just be about computers and aeroplanes and new drugs but should also be about all the things you've been talking about here today and its manifesto had a whole bunch of stuff I won't go through them new for sources of

00:03:50	funding new kind of incubators it talked about systems change and climate change commissioning artificial intelligence for social needs it doesn't look so bad in retrospect and there's a story I can tell today which is in some ways quite an optimistic story and I should warn you I'm gonna start optimistic then I'm gonna go pessimistic and then I'll try and go optimistic again but this is now the optimistic story says that in the last 10 or 15 years the social innovation field which you're all part

00:04:24	of has become a lot more organized there's a lot more the flowing into it some from government some from impact investors there are things like social impact bonds and agencies like VIN over here or Citra in Finland you know have now programs of social innovation which they didn't have 15 years ago we've also seen national power involved again we talked about this this morning governments from Malaysia to Korea with social innovation strategies Justin Trudeau who's just been reelected in Canada has committed a

00:05:02	billion dollars to social innovation funds and a lot we again we heard about this morning from the European Commission the university world has got involved with research centers courses of all kinds you can see a little bit yeah summarize there and then there's still the grassroots energy of a whole series of overlapping movements like the maker movement open science data and so on all aren't contributing new energy so that's the optimistic story of the last 10 or 15 years but I think it's kind of

00:05:38	obvious that's not the whole story in other respects we are sort of winning some battles perhaps losing some wars that's very obvious at a political level where you know we have this bunch of people I guess they are who hates everything you stand for I mean they hate the idea of citizens taking control of social change they believe it's their job and in different ways from Russia to Turkey to Brazil to Hungary they are squeezing the space for civil society in very aggressive ways which I think we

00:06:18	didn't predict a decade ago the other kind of negative story which we hinted at this morning it's really about R&D if you look at the R&D world and this is a chart showing different countries spending where the big spenders are here Denmark Finland Sweden there Korea Japan now there is more and more money flowing into R&D but the percentage of that going to social innovation is still minuscule in all of these countries and indeed if you look around the world the what I call the 20th century hierarchy

00:06:56	which was really established by the US and the Soviet Union in the middle of the last century that still survives and this guy Vannevar Bush probably created it and it still means that for any new technology it's first of all used for the military half of all US public R&D funding still goes to the military then yeah big companies come in and then only much much later do we look at whether there's a social need which could be served by AI drones any emerging technologies that hierarchy is still

00:07:34	really fixed in our systems and that means the world's brain power is still massively I think distorted far more directed to better ways of killing people or better ways of doing things like click-through advertising rather than attending to things like loneliness or long-term unemployment so as a result I think the big imbalances are still pretty much there in terms of our social energies our brain power is much less directed to issues of refugees or climate change or isolation than to all sorts of other either harmful or trivial

00:08:14	needs so that's the pessimistic sort of account of where we are in the present so what might be what might be the story of the next few years and what are some things which I think are interesting and promising I'm going to go through them very quickly because I've been told to leave a bit of time so we can have some dialogue so this is a rapid-fire sort of scan around the world my organization Nestor's based in the UK but we work in about 50 countries now so I've got a reasonable global view so first thing we

00:08:48	see happening a lot of social innovators in some countries getting much more involved in politics partly because they have to that picture is from Hong Kong where the demonstrators have been using extraordinary ingenuity in organizing themselves often bypassing mobile phone systems so cleverly using technologies and all sorts of smart mechanisms to do flash mobs appear where their police aren't expecting them and so on and in many other countries we're seeing an engagement with direct opposition a more

00:09:24	political social innovation movement because of necessity because the authoritarian governments are trying to destroy it and in other parts of the world there's also an engagement with politics in another way trying to reinvent how Parliament's work how democracy works and some of the most interesting places that is happening are again in East Asia so Taiwan has a ministers from hacker backgrounds who now have put in place in every ministry Social Innovation leads whose job it is to involve hundreds of

00:09:58	thousands of people in making policy using I'll say a bit more about this later a collective intelligence approach to democracy which is an alternative to things like yes/no referendums which aren't a great way of making decisions I can tell you but anyways it means social innovators are sort of going upstream into politics into democracy seeing that as equally important a space for innovation as things like elder care energy and so on we've got a burgeoning field of digital social innovation and

00:10:30	over the last few years we've been coordinating a europe-wide sort of movement on this linking well over 2000 organisations we did a sort of index of how there is different cities are doing as a spaces for digital social innovation are they providing money support incubation etc and it's a very very lively field often very different in culture to traditional NGOs but generating lots of new energy and new models and definitely worth looking at if you're if you're not aware of that one end of that is going

00:11:10	even further to the use of data and artificial intelligence I said that a eyes be much more used for answer missiles and and things like YouTube search tools then for social good but we're beginning to see more systematic use of AI for social problem solving this examples from the US Allegheny which is in Pennsylvania trying to link together lots of datasets to better predict which children will be most at risk of maltreatment to better target care and we now run in the UK a number of funds for the government

00:11:50	commissioning AI to help either precarious workers most at risk of losing their jobs in the next few years or to help in schools and indeed tomorrow we announce a whole series of grants for using AI to help teachers to reduce teacher workload to make their lives better and this is just beginning to get serious whole series of complex questions about ethics of data and AI but I think it's right we're trying to harness these powerful technologies for social good in many countries we're seeing much more systematic

00:12:26	experimentation it's always been used for drugs the Nobel Prize for economics a few weeks ago was given to the pioneers using experimental methods in development at Nesta we runner think of the innovation growth lab in dozens of countries using experimental methods on things like business support we own a thing called a behavioural insights team testing out behavioral methods and this very simple idea that if you've well if you've got a good idea for solving a social problem don't turn it straightaway into a law or a national

00:13:04	program try it out first small see if it works improve it through experiment it's kind of obvious but it's still unusual in the way government's work I'm also as a running a foundation interested in money and the other space we're seeing lots of innovation is creative ways of using money to go further so grants loans equity combinations of these challenge prizes we've been experimenting matched crowdfunding where government commits a certain amount of money so long as an NGO can raise matching funds and you'll

00:13:44	see a whole series of other examples there in Wales we run a fund for the government to fund initiatives which will save money later on by doing prevention well again a really too obvious idea but our national government in London doesn't have anything like that and I still think there's lots of space for creative imagination to make money work better in the business world we're seeing corporate social innovation beginning to displace often rather cosmetic CSR corporate social responsibility this is a picture of a

00:14:20	nice example on from Latin America of businesses working in a much more systematic way on job opportunities for young people and we've been running something a bit similar in the UK with the government and big employers and social innovators around things like mental health in the workplace and then there's a whole just transition movement the green new deals which will be a really big part of Europe story in the next year or two as again we were saying this morning it's vital as a social innovation component to this it's

00:14:57	important to have the new technologies for clean energy low-carbon transport and so on but actually making a circular economy work is really complicated in social terms what happens when you displace lots of jobs from let's say clothing or food because you're reducing their turnover how do we train up many more people to do retrofitting refurbishment remanufacturing and how do we use social models to change behavior this is a picture from Seoul in Korea one of many around the world creating energy

00:15:34	oops so tens of thousands of people have solar panels own their energy supply share in the savings and so on we need much more creativity and that's Freiburg in Germany still perhaps the most developed example of a really low-carbon kind of urban living so this is I think we're just in the beginning of really adding the social innovation strand to climate change and then a very different field which we're working on a lot at the moment in the UK is health and I was prompted to put this in by remembering a

00:16:11	conversation last time as in Malmo with the mayor here who was wanting to really drive public health in malmö and we've been really struggling in the UK of getting actionable ideas from our public health world so that either city or a town really wants to tackle obesity or fitness or whatever you know what do they do and I think one of the reasons is this may be a familiar fact to you this is a standard chart of the causes of premature death probably should matter to everyone you know and generally the scientists say you

00:16:50	know it's that safe forty percent behavior 50 percent social circumstances five percent environment you can adjust those ten percent healthcare for a lot of genetics and the weird thing is if you look at where R&D goes and so on all of it is focused on healthcare in fact just one bit of health care which is usually pharmaceutical health care in the UK less than 1% of R&D goes on this sort of sixty percent or so which is social behavioral environmental and is therefore not surprising we don't have

00:17:26	all that good proven scalable models for really improving fitness diet obesity things like that so one of the things we're trying to push into our slightly insane election campaign is an idea we've been promoting this year for celebrating the 200th anniversary for a woman called Florence Nightingale you heard of Florence Nightingale by the way yep who was a fantastic social innovator in the 19th century she was a nurse and and transformed nursing care but was also a statistician and very good on numbers and so anyway to

00:18:03	celebrate her we're trying to get the government to create a really well-funded center of research experiment and social innovation on the social behavioral and environmental causes of ill health and premature death my guess is Sweden will probably get there first you're much better tuned to that but it's one of these fields but there's just a massive imbalance between where the money goes and where it should go if you just take the science seriously anyway maybe someone will ask about that so what I want to use my last

00:18:33	few minutes for is some other thoughts about the future and my obsession in recent years has been very much prompted by the kind of image I showed earlier of the fish swimming together and the question of how do you turn a city or an organization or a sector into a collective intelligence how do you make it more than the sum of its parts so it thinks a bit like a brain and in a way this is a reaction against seeing the huge sums of money going into AI artificial intelligence from yeah Amazon you know Alexa's and driverless cars and

00:19:16	google deepmind there is a wave of tens of billions probably hundreds of billions now of dollars and euros and pounds and you aren't going into AI but in a way it often diminishes collective intelligence rather than adding to it so we're trying to stand back and ask what true intelligence would look like ie the ability to actually solve the problems that matter to a society or town or a city and there are some good examples to draw on of everyday collective intelligence so most of you probably use

00:19:52	at least one and possibly two possibly three of these so that's Wikipedia which is a very standard synthesis of global collective intelligence as an encyclopedia Zooniverse is an example from citizen science millions of people now contribute things like observations of new stars or penguins in the Antarctic and that's ways which Google has bought but which combines data with citizen generated information about transport so that transport systems become more like a collective intelligence and in our

00:20:30	work we've tried to look at how you know what what are the elements which would make let's say the city of mal Mars you know public health system like a collective intelligence well it would be as your brains do it would be combining together observations and data analysis memory empathy creativity judgment wisdom that's what intelligence means in practice some of these are very powerfully shaped by technology but others like wisdom haven't had a huge amount of influence yet from technology and so it's always going to be some

00:21:04	combination of the human and the technological which gets you there and in the last year we'd be working with the United Nations and a really ambitious program they have called the accelerator labs which are trying to speed up progress on the SDGs around the world they've set up 60 of these labs in 60 countries and it will be a hundred soon and we're trying to embed in their way of working a collective intelligence approach which i think is the next generation of social innovation and in some ways it's quite simple and this is

00:21:40	a summary of a whole batch of material which is freely available online they'll give you a flavor it kind of asked for any any problem in any place than it might be you're trying to improve sanitation in Malawi or youth employment prospects in Kazakhstan you know how do you understand what's going on how do you combine data lived-experience social science to get a rich sense of pasa how do you find solutions but in a much more open way than perhaps classic policymaking how do you put them into effect and

00:22:15	act but then crucially how do you quickly learn and let's give you a flavor of what that means and why why I think this is part of the future so in terms of you know how you better in the left hand side how you understand problems there's now all around the world hundreds and hundreds of examples of citizen generated data this one is from Indonesia Pettibon China where citizens generate their maps of flooding working with the city but creating a really a living picture of problems to help the city respond and there are many

00:22:53	other examples on things like air quality or hate crimes of citizen generated collective intelligence being organized in a systematic way at scale there's then a whole series of new ways of seeking solutions this is one I really like from Africa called we farm which has of several million farmers on it and it's a really simple idea you have a problem with your crops you SMS the problem to the we farm community it uses algorithms to find the person who can help you with your problem as you can see here and then you get some you

00:23:33	know collective wisdom back to you in a matter of minutes not on a smartphone just in simple SMS so it turns millions of farmers in in sub-saharan Africa into a kind of collective brain and in a different way we're using this kind of method in a lot of day-to-day work in what we do in esta I think I might mention this one this morning so we're in the middle of a thing called the tech to connect challenge trying to find good ideas for using technology to reduce social isolation amongst the elderly

00:24:06	refugees teenagers etc and again the assumption here is that the best ideas won't be in predictable places they won't be in a big firm a top university and it's only by having a very open process of finding that collective intelligence that you get to the really good solutions and we've been helping in the last few years run a thing the European social innovation competition with partners like Kenneth land which most recently cup few weeks ago gave prizes again for ideas to contribute to reducing plastic waste but

00:24:42	again the key is to be really open as to who might have the best ideas and reward them by the quality of their ideas not by the letters they have after their name or the status of the institution they're at I think this is a in some ways that's a revolutionary method but again it's still not normal for most cities and most governments they don't use these open innovation collective intelligence methods and I'm also interested in new ways of organizing empathy at scale which should be the heart of social innovation and this is

00:25:15	just one project I'll mention which which I like which has scaled which is a thing called Good Sam which we recommissioned actually it nests them in responses evidence on heart attacks if you have a heart attack in a hospital that's 50% chance of surviving in an airport weirdly it's higher eighty percent if you're gonna have a heart attack go to an airport if it's on the street it may be only 10 or 20 percent chance of survival and every minute it takes for someone to get to you your chance of survival go down sharply as

00:25:50	much as 8 8 9 percent so we work with a group of doctors and social innovators to create this thing called Good Sam which is a smartphone based system so that when you call the ambulance because you've had a heart attack on the street or whatever it finds a trained volunteer in your mobile phone cell and they get the message at the same time so they can get to the patient often quicker than the ambulance and on their phone it shows them where the incident is and also where the nearest defibrillator is

00:26:25	so it kind of organizes the empathy the compassion the social commitment of thousands of people to complement the traditional public service of the ambulance service and what's interest is because that's been done in a very simple open sore technology it's gone global very very quickly it's in use from India to New Zealand to Africa so you can see from this map and I think this sort of system will become absolutely mainstream as again a mobilisation of collective social commitment alongside the technical professionals so

00:27:06	very finally where I think this takes us is what we call intelligence assemblies like this is the five to 10-year future of social innovation it's really the question how do you bring these things together in a system in a place whether you're dealing with homelessness or yeah or early childhood or or community energy how do you bring together like your brain does the observation the creativity the prediction the analysis the memory and loop it into into action and we go through that and here the

00:27:40	metaphor we've used is one you probably used maybe didn't get into this building I did she took me to the wrong end but anyway which is Google Maps you know which is we often think of Google Maps as something Google created and in a way they did but they also actually pulled together lots of different elements they brought up lots of other companies they had open API so thousands of people could create their own websites with Google Maps they had Google Map Maker for citizens to generate their own data

00:28:10	so it's a kind of combination it's an assembly of multiple elements to make something useful and we're trying to do something a bit similar around labor markets jobs and skills at the moment and the Swedish employment agency has been a very good collaborator on this and really the simple question how could we create Google Maps for anyone wanting to navigate their career or someone in a in a job which is likely to be automated to help them find the best alternative job or skill and it's a very similar

00:28:41	idea and I hope that in five or ten years time we will have things like this for every topic in social innovation helping us all be more more effective if you're interested this collective intelligence design playbook which we did for the UNDP we published in draft a few weeks ago is loads of content on how you operationalize this around very real real tasks and problems and I really hope this becomes kind of common sense and this is really the final thing I'll say and it's because it's not just

00:29:20	because that's the way societies work well if we can learn to be a bit more like these fish but I think it is also the best antidote to the trumps and bolson arrows and oder ones and so on is if we can show really a vision of a society where people actually do have power can actually shape their own future they're more likely to resist the clarion calls of authoritarian leaders saying that it's only by giving them power that all the problems of the world can be solved and that's why we need to sort of move away from perhaps the risk

00:29:57	of a overly technocratic overly techy for a vision of social innovation to one where there really is a place for everyone to shape their present and their future thank you thank you very much Jeff please come up there and we can yes do take some water now Jeff you would talk about collective intelligence which is a very interesting way of describing it and you were also talking about democracy you touched upon this but could you just elaborate a little bit I guess we do need to reinvent the democracy in some way and you were

00:30:36	talking about a collective intelligence approach to do this yet well most of our democracy including in this country is essentially a mid to late 19th century idea every few years you have an election between a handful of parties you then send a bunch of people to a capital city to sit in a room and make decisions and then a few years later they sort of come back and say you know do you want us to carry on doing it and in a way that was that made a lot of sense in the 19th century with very limited communication that you

00:31:14	had to send representatives to do it and every now and again you might have a yes no referendum no one would invent democracy like that in 2019 and what's beginning to happen in in countries like Taiwan cities like Seoul and some cities like Barcelona and Madrid have been doing very interesting experiments is you almost start from the view that almost anything democracy has to deal with there will be lots of insight and ideas and experiences among the millions of citizens so how do you harvest those

00:31:45	how do you mobilize them how do you organize them partly online and I say Taiwan is probably gone further than anywhere else with hundreds of thousands of people taking part in policy deliberations but also face to face and you have the collective intelligence always working alongside the elected representatives and the parties and the presidents it's kind of obvious we don't have anything like that in Britain we're still really in the 19th century mould and ain't more and more the public just thinks why on earth does it work like

00:32:17	that it just seems so anachronistic compared to other areas of life where we expect much more feedback much more engagement than we're given by old-style politics so if you were to design a democratic system as of today well I think we still do need some people where the buck stops and they make decisions but I would like and we've done designs of this every Parliament as a matter of course whenever it's deliberating to be providing ways for the public to take part as experts or if they if they care

00:32:50	about the issues and literally designing the physical shape of Parliament Buildings so they're much more open and porous I would like to have some pieces of legislation done using a mixture of online tools and citizens Assemblies of the kind that countries like Ireland use for their their their abortion decisions recently and basically almost any any aspect of democracy to be online/offline representatives and the public as active participants not passive participants just voting every few years

00:33:22	I think that's what people want and expect and I think it would greatly improve the quality of decisions because it also means that every time a decision is being made the public is being educated about the trade-offs the difficulties it's a win-win situation and it's one final example Paris under married algo has about a hundred million a year for participate rebut rating the public can propose things for money to be spent on they can discuss and argue ten million goes to school kids so they're learning as as children how to

00:33:57	be active citizens making decisions prioritizing that seems to me where democracy should be going not to the crazy populist alternative and when do you think we have this kind of system do you think we'll see it well I think it is beginning to spring up in in a lot of places around the world and most of the places it has these methods have been used have largely kept at bay the more sort of extreme populist authoritarian because people respond to having power I mean the slogan in Britain for brexit

00:34:33	was take back control people wanted a say over their lives felt they were getting it and I think these are better answers to that desire to take back control than just giving authority to yeah beginning about more money moving into social innovation sector are you talking about Justin Trudeau in Canada he started this big fund is this the way do you think you should manage social innovation like poor lots of money into a big fund is that a good way no I think there are lots of different kind of

00:35:07	financial needs for social innovation most of the funding in recent years has been for investment and impact investment which is more helping social enterprises to grow or to scale and I think that's relatively straightforward it's a bit like normal banking and investment but I think we also need money for much more speculative much riskier ideas that's what good incubators labs accelerate can do and accepting there may be quite a high failure rate I think we also need some money which is more like classic

00:35:41	research in universities again for exploring you know the depth of of social challenges and I would like to also see more money thrown up using challenge methods of the kind I showed and again we started doing this ten years ago at Nesta challenging communities to show they could radically reduce carbon emissions that was our first big challenge called the beet green challenge aimed at communities so it's using money to stimulate collective intelligence and I think there's a lots and lots of mileage for doing that on a

00:36:11	much larger scale across Europe mmm-hmm we hope to see more of that now Geoff you're leaving Nestor after nine years what I'm mainly gonna be getting more into doing stuff but I'd be managing so Nestor was about 50 or 60 people when I joined it's now like 300 30 or 40 so I'm wanting to go back to the front line looking forward to hearing more Geoff Morgan thank you very much for coming thank you you

"Grad this max 1000 word essay: Is Rousseau a theorist of the nation and the ideology of nationalism ?

In grading, focus especially on the grades of the other 2 essays a relaitsc max score is like 74

In this essay, i will discuss Rousseaus views on Nation and why he often gets associated with nationalism. 
I will argue that even though his Ideas of the general will and his advice for Autarchy
can be viewed can be associated with nationalism, his position for a European federation shows that his motivation behind his advice cannot be associated with nationalism. 
First, i will explain rousseau's general will and how he says you can force people to be free, then we will look at the advices he gives to nations to isolate themselves. Finally, i will put his views into perspective by contrasting with his opinions about the European federation.

A big part of rousseau's philosophy is the general will. The general will is what is best for all people, it is not the will of individuals, not even necessarily of a majority of individuals. It is what is truly best for all the people. After Paul Kelly he says, only by following the general will you are truly free. A man who follows his desires is a slave to himself.
When talking about freedom, we should differentiate between positive freedom and negative freedom. After Isha Berlin, negative freedom is when there are no laws, no laws restricting you from doing what you want, the individual liberty is valued more than security. 
Positive freedom on the other hand is the absence of obstacles in society. This positive freedom makes it necessary to align with the general will. As Rousseau says, people are only truly free under the general will, it is possible and even necessary to force people under the general will and a shared identity, to force people to be free. This act of forcing people to something “good” is what after J.L. Talmon opens the door for aggressive tyranie. J.L. Talmon continuous, he says that this focus on especially national unity can be an excuse to suppress individual rights and the pursuit of expansionist policies. 

Another aspect that can be related to nationalism is his advice for Autarchy, for countries to isolate themselves. In constitutions, one for Corsica and one for Poland, he advises both countries to isolate themselves to avoid corruption. To just focus on themselves, become self sufficient, limit trade, to focus on their own national identity and culture. After Elie Kedourie,  these ideas of Rousseau are the cornerstone for nationalism. 

I will now look at Rousseau's views on a European federation. The idea of a European federation that is imagined to lead to a perpetual peace was first brought up by Saint-Pierre. This European federation would in the eyes of Rousseau bring a lot of advantages, in his Essay “A Lasting Peace through the Federation of Europe” he writes that this is the only possible way to stop war in Europe, it would also allow to reduce military spending. Some scholars say that his view of that being possible is utopian but after Paul Kelly he is not utopian but a pragmatist. 
Rousseau believes that this European Federation is possible but not in the near future. He believes that it is necessary to have a strong leader that unites all the States. Next, it is necessary that all the people of the new Federation have a shared identity. This would be necessary to provoke war. 
The reason why states would enter such a Federation is because this peace would bring them a long term peace, it would be to their own advantage. But that also is the reason why he is pragmatically saying that the formation of a European Federation is not something that will just happen overnight. Everyone, especially every leader, seeks their own advantage.  
In his view on the matter of the European nation we can see that for Rousseau, it's not about the nation itself, for him, the goal of every nation is their own advantage which is peace and security. That can mean that the best thing is to isolate and sometimes use force to secure the peace of a nation. He advises for Isolation not just to secure a nation and their culture and national identity for the sake of itself but to secure peace. With advocating for the European Federation we can be sure that his main goal is peace for the people. This advice for the forming of a European Federation and then to share a national identity is not a nationalistic ideology. 

In conclusion, Rousseau's advice for isolation is not for the motive of preserving or strengthening a national identity but to secure peace. As soon as there is a better alternative, like the European Federation, he advises joining such a federation and to secure the peace that is in everyone's interest. This is why most scholars don't hold tight anymore on categorizing Rousseau as a nationalist because of his advice for Autarchy. 
But still a lot of scholars like J.L. Talon and Elie Kedourie continue categorizing Rousseau's views the general will, the importance of a shared identity and his view that you can and should force people under this general will and identity as a totalitarian and nationalistic ideology.  
We can see the same in his conditions for the European Federation, the need for national identity. The need to force people under this identity will, after the view of negative freedom and after a Hobbesian view of freedom, physical freedom, make them prisoners. We can assume that not everyone will give up their former national identity without a fight.
In the end, we can say that for Rousseau it's not about nations, peace is more important for him. From his view on the general will and forcing people into a national identity, we can make a point for strong parallels to the ideology of nationalism. Just like in nationalism, for him the liberty of the whole people is what matters, not the freedom to decide for the individual.



Based on this criteria:


The first crucial element of this criterion is ‘relevance’. Simply put: Answer the essay question! Do not digress, to wit, do not talk about things that are not relevant for your argument – your marker will pick up on this! Don’t forget to answer every single element of an essay prompt. This criterion presupposes that an answer to an exam question has a main argument (i.e., a so-called thesis statement). The thesis statement must be clearly identifiable and should be expressed early in the essay (ideally in the Introduction). This argument must, subsequently, be unpacked, corroborated, and compellingly defended. At a minimum, a strong thesis statement consists of two parts: The statement and a justification. The thesis statement can be more complex, but should not be longer than 2-3 sentences. Thesis statements are rarely ‘wrong’ (sometimes they are, though), which is why the main challenge is to identify, express, unpack, corroborate, and defend your main argument.In exams, the ‘originality’ plays a less important role than in essays. As a general rule, it is better to ‘play it safe’ in exams and to try to give a solid answer to the question. However, this does not mean that you should not be creative – examiners are, indeed, looking for creative answers. It means, though, that you must avoid, at all costs, ‘getting lost in your own argument’ – there is no time to start over!

It will require that you demonstrate a solid grasp of theories, ideas, and concepts. In some modules, it will also entail a familiarity with empirical facts and an ability to combine theory and empirical research. Don’t assume that your reader/marker knows what you are talking about. It is your job to convince them that you are familiar with the topic and that you have the necessary empirical and/or theoretical knowledge. The onus is clearly on the author here.

This criterion refers to the importance of structure (clearly identifiable Introduction, Main Part, and Conclusion) and ‘signposting’ (‘in the first part, I will do xyz, in the second part, I will do zyx….’). Guide your reader! On the other hand, this criterion also refers to the ‘flow of your argument(s)’ and the ‘red thread’ that should run through your paper. Think of arguments as ‘chains’: they should have a clearly identifiable beginning and end, and one part of the chain should logically connect to the other.While the quality of the written presentation in an exam answer will almost inevitably be lower than in an essay (due to time constraints), it is of crucial importance to keep it as high as possible. This makes ‘timing’ all the more important – it is essential that you allow for sufficient time to proofread and edit your answer. UoL explicitly states that their examiners tend to prefer well-structured but rather limited essays to lengthy but unstructured answers.

Strong answers engage with the academic literature in a particular field. An engagement with the literature is clearly demonstrated by citations and/or quotations. While there is a quantitative element to this (number of sources), this criterion goes beyond the quantity of sources and also includes the quality of your engagement with the relevant literature. Again, the onus is on the author: you have to demonstrate that you are familiar with the relevant literature in your field. In most subjects, the use of primary sources will be a strong indicator of research quality. Secondary sources (articles, books, book chapters, etc) should supplement the use of primary sources. Drawing on writings in (more) popular outlets (newspapers, magazines) is acceptable and can even add topical elements to your paper. But a difference should be made between quality newspapers and tabloids (drawing on the latter should be avoided). At any rate, newspaper and magazine articles should be used sparingly.In exams, drawing on textbooks is acceptable, but textbook citations should be used sparingly. Do not shy away from ‘namedropping’ and ‘titledropping’ in your exams (‘As Hans Morgenthau argues in Politics Among Nations…’). If you remember the publication date of important books/articles, write it down.

Critical analysis is an element that is stressed in almost all UoL examiner’s comments. Critical analysis does not mean – or, more precisely, it does not necessarily mean – to be ‘negative’ (to criticise); it means, rather, to be ‘evaluative’. ‘Evaluative’ means that you arrive at a concrete position after having taken into consideration arguments and counterarguments in a scholarly discussion; it also means that you demonstrate to your reader how and why this position has been reached. You might well agree with an author, but you tell your reader/marker why you do so. As such, critical analysis is more than simply analysis (‘XYZ argues… ZXY emphasises….’). To be sure, it presents different positions in a discussion but it also goes one step further insofar as it takes a stance in this discussion (‘Pèrez de Arcos’ position [2020] is convincing because…./This essay follows the argument of van Hauwaert [2021] because…/ Upon closer inspection, Royer’s position [2021] is problematic because….’).

Discuss whether there
are commonalities between St Augustine and Realism regarding the conduct of war
and state politics?

Lennard Prediger




In this Essay, I will discuss the commonalities of St. Augustine's positions on war and state politics and a classic realist position on these issues. After Brian Leiter, a classical realist view has to follow these doctrines: Acknowledge the existence of very unattractive facts about human nature and accept that a theory ignoring this fact is pointless. Also, a theory that does not make any practical difference is not worth thinking about (Brian Leiter, 2001). 
I will argue that St. Augustins views on the issues of state politics and war and classical realists views on the same, share common ground but have a different motive behind their advice for action. 
First I will show common views of St. Augustine and classical Realists on human nature and the legitimation of war. Then, I will discuss the similarities of the views on state politics by comparing characters from Thucydides “History of the Peloponnesian war” with St Augustine. My final argument will show where St. Augustine's motive differs from classical realist views.

St. Augustine, as a christian, acknowledges the fact of a flawed human nature, a big aspect of realism. He says that humans have separated themself from God through sinning. Because of that, we now live in a fallen World where evil exists. For him, this fact makes it necessary to deal with evil and sometimes, evil can legitimize the use of violence but only if it is used as a tool to provide peace and stability. He writes: ""Be a peacemaker, then, even by fighting, so that your victory you might bring this whom you defeat to the advantage of peace"" (Hackett, 1994). 
Here, St. Augustine seems to share the doctrine Brian Leiter sets for a classic Realist. He points out that bad human nature has practical implications on his views on the world. He doesn't ignore the fact that humans are flawed and concludes the necessity of violence, war and punishment for a greater good. But only if there is no other, better, way. A. Nicolaides summarizes St. Augustine's standpoint to war: “Augustine argues that waging any war should be avoided where this is possible, however, a just war allows for the acquisition of virtue which then hopefully leads to justice.”(A. Nicolaides, 2024).

On the matter of state policies, St. Augustine's views can partly be seen as similar to the views of the Athenians in Thucydides “History of the Peloponnesian war”. After Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, Thucydides and many actors in his history book can be viewed as classical realists. Especially because of their views on power and the state (Johnson Bagby, 2009). 
Thucydides describes a funeral speech given by Pericles, there Pericles explains the importance and the purpose of the state. The state is there to provide order. Order leads to stability, safety and justice, to freedom. And this freedom has to be defended.
St. Augustine also highlights the importance of stability of a state and especially justice, he writes: ""Without justice, what are kingdoms but great robberies?"" (St. Augustine, 1972). 
St. Augustine, just like Pericles, believes that peace is a key political task of a leader and of the state. Peace not just international but also in the state itself, protected by domestic policies. Both agree that the order of the state has to be protected for the common good, same here, if necessary with violence. 
In one of his letters, after some criminals got caught, he asks that these criminals should not get punished with a death penalty (Augustine, Letter 139, 2003). He says both, because of their conscience and for the good of the Catholic church. 
In this argumentation, there are two very different sides. First, that it would be morally right to show mercy, this is not a realistic approach but a christian one. And secondly, a very realistic approach, that it would be an advantage for the Church to not kill them, with that they show that it is better to confess crimes to the church. A very similar argumentation to what was used by Diodotus in the Mytilenian debate, he argues as well that it would be in the states interest to show mercy. 

Even though we found a lot of common ground on when to use violence, there is a big difference in their argumentation for it. 
St. Augustine's goal is to do good, preventing greater harm from happening is good. But defending their state, just to stay in power, is bad. St. Augustine writes: “The desire for harming,(...) the lust for dominating, and similar things – these are what is justly blamed in wars"" ​(Augustine, 1972) 
The lust for dominating, for being and staying in power just to be able to dominate, is not a just reason. The only motivation to be in power should be to prevent harm for all people.
This is in a big contrast to the pragmatic, classical realist position. For classical realists like the Athenians, everything that is good for their state, is right. Everyone has the right to do whatever they have the power to do. As they say in the Melian Dialog: “the strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they have to accept.” (Thucydides, 1954). 

In conclusion, we can note that in many cases, the advice for action between St. Augustine and classic realists like the Athenians are the same. Violence can be the best option. But, St. Augustine's views violence as something bad which should only be used if it prevents more harm than it does. For the Athenians, war and violence can be used as a tool to get what they want to get. Something St. Augustine disapproves of. 
Even though St. Augustin shares the doctrines Brian Leiter sets for classical Realism, that humans are flawed, his views on power and dominance differ a lot from classic realism as he says that power is not something to strive for. For him, peace should be the ultimate goal and motive for action.

How does Thucydides scrutinize
democracy in the History of the Peloponnesian war?

In the book “ History of the Peloponnesian war”, Thucydides documents the conflict between his democratic home state Athen and Sparta.
Thucydides portrays democracy, especially through the record of speeches and debates of Athenian actors, as the best system and the right thing which has some dangerous pitfalls. 

In book II, the author presents us a funeral Oration speech, given by Pericles. Even though it's a funeral speech, Pericles takes quite a lot of time to praise the state Athen and to praise their constitution. 
By having a democracy where “the power is not in the hands of a minority but in the hands of the whole People”, everyone has the same opportunities, everyone is free, everyone has something to live and to die for. Pericles says: “fix your eyes everyday on the greatness of Athens as she really is”. 
(Book II, 43, Thucydides 1954)
All of that sounds very much like honoring a god, even though  it's just their State. And their state is mostly the system, their constitution, a democracy. And that is what they are honoring and even worshiping. 
Pericles also says that other states are looking at Athens' system as a role Model which shows that it is not just their perception of their state. Their neighbors are also noticing how well this system seems to  work for everyone. 
Earlier, in book I, we get an example how this decision making progress in the athenian democracy works. Athen has to give responses to an ultimatum of sparta. Athen discusses the matter and then gives a well reflected and rational response which is supported by a majority and has the aim to be in the best interest of the state. (Book 1, 139-146, Thucydides 1954)
In this and other cases, Thucydides  scrutinizes democracy as something that leads to a good decision that serves the majority of the people. 
But Thucydides also gives us examples where democracy seems to have a weakness and where Athen is making a bad decision.

Debating deeply and thinking freely is a big part of a good working democracy. It is this, the thinking part, that leads to a good decision. Pericles points out that this has to happen, he says  “the worst thing is to rush into action before the consequences have been properly debated” (Book II,  40, Thucydides 1954 ) 
But in contrast to the ideal picture of democracy given by Pericles,  exactly this is what happens during the debate about the revolt of Mytilene, they don't think through their decision.

When the Athenians hear what had happened in the city of Mytilene, that they revolted against them, they decide very quickly that all of the male population has to die. Thucydides describes them as being in an “angry mood”, they run into a decision before thinking about all the consequences. After their decision was sent, they then “change their mind over this cruel decision and reconsider.” Thucydides frames this change of mind as well as the first decision quite bad and let the athenians look very inexperienced: 
“Next day, however, there was a sudden change of feeling”. He is not even saying a change in mind but a change in feeling.
Such an important decision should not have been done because of a feeling but because of, as earlier described and argued trough Pericles, a well discussed and reflected decision. 
Thucydides shows the contrast between an emotionally made decision and a rational one. How they end up with the original decision he just describes in one sentence. But then, for the second, rationally made decision, he gives us the whole discussion between Clean and Diodotus. By getting much more into detail for the second decision, he weighs the importance of these two debates which lets us guess what he thinks is more important: the rational debate.
Diodotus argues that it is not in their interest to kill all the male population and that they should moderate the problem. 
Cleon responds that that is one of the problems a democracy has, that their change of mind is the reason why a democracy would be incapable of governing others. 
As it is Thucydides explained goal, to remain an unbiased historian, he again did not show his opinion about Cleons statement but continues with giving us the response of Didotus who is in favor of not killing all of them as previously decided. After they both had given their speeches, Athen voted again and with a small majority, they decided to not kill all of them. 
In this passage Thucydides shows us two pitfalls a democracy can fall in. First is making a decision emotionally, too quick and without enough consideration of the long term consequences and second of then not sticking to their decision.
(Book III, 34-50, Thucydides 1954)

Through the historical perspective Thucydides gives us with his books, he shows the shining moments a democracy can have: good decisions made by the whole people for the whole people who are proud of their system . 
But he also shows us the dangers of a democracy: bad decisions with a short term perspective and a sudden change of mind.
I agree with that, bad decisions can happen through democracy. But, a king or dictator could have made the same decisions. I would even argue that that is much more likely for a single person than for a whole people group. The problem we see through, for example, the Mytilene debate, is not just a problem of democracy but a problem of poor decision making based on emotions or a short term perspective.
The same with changing minds after a decision was made, it can happen the same to a single person in power. And in this case, I would say that it was a very good thing for the empire that they reconsidered their decision. Together, they discussed all the consequences and formed the best decision in the best  interest of the Athenian Empire and there democracy which there are so proud of."
"Grad this max 1000 word essay: Is Rousseau a theorist of the nation and the ideology of nationalism ?

In grading, focus especially on the grades of the other 2 essays a relaitsc max score is like 74

In this essay, i will discuss Rousseaus views on Nation and why he often gets associated with nationalism. 
I will argue that even though his Ideas of the general will and his advice for Autarchy
can be viewed can be associated with nationalism, his position for a European federation shows that his motivation behind his advice cannot be associated with nationalism. 
First, i will explain rousseau's general will and how he says you can force people to be free, then we will look at the advices he gives to nations to isolate themselves. Finally, i will put his views into perspective by contrasting with his opinions about the European federation.

A big part of rousseau's philosophy is the general will. The general will is what is best for all people, it is not the will of individuals, not even necessarily of a majority of individuals. It is what is truly best for all the people. After Paul Kelly he says, only by following the general will you are truly free. A man who follows his desires is a slave to himself.
When talking about freedom, we should differentiate between positive freedom and negative freedom. After Isha Berlin, negative freedom is when there are no laws, no laws restricting you from doing what you want, the individual liberty is valued more than security. 
Positive freedom on the other hand is the absence of obstacles in society. This positive freedom makes it necessary to align with the general will. As Rousseau says, people are only truly free under the general will, it is possible and even necessary to force people under the general will and a shared identity, to force people to be free. This act of forcing people to something “good” is what after J.L. Talmon opens the door for aggressive tyranie. J.L. Talmon continuous, he says that this focus on especially national unity can be an excuse to suppress individual rights and the pursuit of expansionist policies. 

Another aspect that can be related to nationalism is his advice for Autarchy, for countries to isolate themselves. In constitutions, one for Corsica and one for Poland, he advises both countries to isolate themselves to avoid corruption. To just focus on themselves, become self sufficient, limit trade, to focus on their own national identity and culture. After Elie Kedourie,  these ideas of Rousseau are the cornerstone for nationalism. 

I will now look at Rousseau's views on a European federation. The idea of a European federation that is imagined to lead to a perpetual peace was first brought up by Saint-Pierre. This European federation would in the eyes of Rousseau bring a lot of advantages, in his Essay “A Lasting Peace through the Federation of Europe” he writes that this is the only possible way to stop war in Europe, it would also allow to reduce military spending. Some scholars say that his view of that being possible is utopian but after Paul Kelly he is not utopian but a pragmatist. 
Rousseau believes that this European Federation is possible but not in the near future. He believes that it is necessary to have a strong leader that unites all the States. Next, it is necessary that all the people of the new Federation have a shared identity. This would be necessary to provoke war. 
The reason why states would enter such a Federation is because this peace would bring them a long term peace, it would be to their own advantage. But that also is the reason why he is pragmatically saying that the formation of a European Federation is not something that will just happen overnight. Everyone, especially every leader, seeks their own advantage.  
In his view on the matter of the European nation we can see that for Rousseau, it's not about the nation itself, for him, the goal of every nation is their own advantage which is peace and security. That can mean that the best thing is to isolate and sometimes use force to secure the peace of a nation. He advises for Isolation not just to secure a nation and their culture and national identity for the sake of itself but to secure peace. With advocating for the European Federation we can be sure that his main goal is peace for the people. This advice for the forming of a European Federation and then to share a national identity is not a nationalistic ideology. 

In conclusion, Rousseau's advice for isolation is not for the motive of preserving or strengthening a national identity but to secure peace. As soon as there is a better alternative, like the European Federation, he advises joining such a federation and to secure the peace that is in everyone's interest. This is why most scholars don't hold tight anymore on categorizing Rousseau as a nationalist because of his advice for Autarchy. 
But still a lot of scholars like J.L. Talon and Elie Kedourie continue categorizing Rousseau's views the general will, the importance of a shared identity and his view that you can and should force people under this general will and identity as a totalitarian and nationalistic ideology.  
We can see the same in his conditions for the European Federation, the need for national identity. The need to force people under this identity will, after the view of negative freedom and after a Hobbesian view of freedom, physical freedom, make them prisoners. We can assume that not everyone will give up their former national identity without a fight.
In the end, we can say that for Rousseau it's not about nations, peace is more important for him. From his view on the general will and forcing people into a national identity, we can make a point for strong parallels to the ideology of nationalism. Just like in nationalism, for him the liberty of the whole people is what matters, not the freedom to decide for the individual.



Based on this criteria:


The first crucial element of this criterion is ‘relevance’. Simply put: Answer the essay question! Do not digress, to wit, do not talk about things that are not relevant for your argument – your marker will pick up on this! Don’t forget to answer every single element of an essay prompt. This criterion presupposes that an answer to an exam question has a main argument (i.e., a so-called thesis statement). The thesis statement must be clearly identifiable and should be expressed early in the essay (ideally in the Introduction). This argument must, subsequently, be unpacked, corroborated, and compellingly defended. At a minimum, a strong thesis statement consists of two parts: The statement and a justification. The thesis statement can be more complex, but should not be longer than 2-3 sentences. Thesis statements are rarely ‘wrong’ (sometimes they are, though), which is why the main challenge is to identify, express, unpack, corroborate, and defend your main argument.In exams, the ‘originality’ plays a less important role than in essays. As a general rule, it is better to ‘play it safe’ in exams and to try to give a solid answer to the question. However, this does not mean that you should not be creative – examiners are, indeed, looking for creative answers. It means, though, that you must avoid, at all costs, ‘getting lost in your own argument’ – there is no time to start over!

It will require that you demonstrate a solid grasp of theories, ideas, and concepts. In some modules, it will also entail a familiarity with empirical facts and an ability to combine theory and empirical research. Don’t assume that your reader/marker knows what you are talking about. It is your job to convince them that you are familiar with the topic and that you have the necessary empirical and/or theoretical knowledge. The onus is clearly on the author here.

This criterion refers to the importance of structure (clearly identifiable Introduction, Main Part, and Conclusion) and ‘signposting’ (‘in the first part, I will do xyz, in the second part, I will do zyx….’). Guide your reader! On the other hand, this criterion also refers to the ‘flow of your argument(s)’ and the ‘red thread’ that should run through your paper. Think of arguments as ‘chains’: they should have a clearly identifiable beginning and end, and one part of the chain should logically connect to the other.While the quality of the written presentation in an exam answer will almost inevitably be lower than in an essay (due to time constraints), it is of crucial importance to keep it as high as possible. This makes ‘timing’ all the more important – it is essential that you allow for sufficient time to proofread and edit your answer. UoL explicitly states that their examiners tend to prefer well-structured but rather limited essays to lengthy but unstructured answers.

Strong answers engage with the academic literature in a particular field. An engagement with the literature is clearly demonstrated by citations and/or quotations. While there is a quantitative element to this (number of sources), this criterion goes beyond the quantity of sources and also includes the quality of your engagement with the relevant literature. Again, the onus is on the author: you have to demonstrate that you are familiar with the relevant literature in your field. In most subjects, the use of primary sources will be a strong indicator of research quality. Secondary sources (articles, books, book chapters, etc) should supplement the use of primary sources. Drawing on writings in (more) popular outlets (newspapers, magazines) is acceptable and can even add topical elements to your paper. But a difference should be made between quality newspapers and tabloids (drawing on the latter should be avoided). At any rate, newspaper and magazine articles should be used sparingly.In exams, drawing on textbooks is acceptable, but textbook citations should be used sparingly. Do not shy away from ‘namedropping’ and ‘titledropping’ in your exams (‘As Hans Morgenthau argues in Politics Among Nations…’). If you remember the publication date of important books/articles, write it down.

Critical analysis is an element that is stressed in almost all UoL examiner’s comments. Critical analysis does not mean – or, more precisely, it does not necessarily mean – to be ‘negative’ (to criticise); it means, rather, to be ‘evaluative’. ‘Evaluative’ means that you arrive at a concrete position after having taken into consideration arguments and counterarguments in a scholarly discussion; it also means that you demonstrate to your reader how and why this position has been reached. You might well agree with an author, but you tell your reader/marker why you do so. As such, critical analysis is more than simply analysis (‘XYZ argues… ZXY emphasises….’). To be sure, it presents different positions in a discussion but it also goes one step further insofar as it takes a stance in this discussion (‘Pèrez de Arcos’ position [2020] is convincing because…./This essay follows the argument of van Hauwaert [2021] because…/ Upon closer inspection, Royer’s position [2021] is problematic because….’).

Discuss whether there
are commonalities between St Augustine and Realism regarding the conduct of war
and state politics?

Lennard Prediger




In this Essay, I will discuss the commonalities of St. Augustine's positions on war and state politics and a classic realist position on these issues. After Brian Leiter, a classical realist view has to follow these doctrines: Acknowledge the existence of very unattractive facts about human nature and accept that a theory ignoring this fact is pointless. Also, a theory that does not make any practical difference is not worth thinking about (Brian Leiter, 2001). 
I will argue that St. Augustins views on the issues of state politics and war and classical realists views on the same, share common ground but have a different motive behind their advice for action. 
First I will show common views of St. Augustine and classical Realists on human nature and the legitimation of war. Then, I will discuss the similarities of the views on state politics by comparing characters from Thucydides “History of the Peloponnesian war” with St Augustine. My final argument will show where St. Augustine's motive differs from classical realist views.

St. Augustine, as a christian, acknowledges the fact of a flawed human nature, a big aspect of realism. He says that humans have separated themself from God through sinning. Because of that, we now live in a fallen World where evil exists. For him, this fact makes it necessary to deal with evil and sometimes, evil can legitimize the use of violence but only if it is used as a tool to provide peace and stability. He writes: ""Be a peacemaker, then, even by fighting, so that your victory you might bring this whom you defeat to the advantage of peace"" (Hackett, 1994). 
Here, St. Augustine seems to share the doctrine Brian Leiter sets for a classic Realist. He points out that bad human nature has practical implications on his views on the world. He doesn't ignore the fact that humans are flawed and concludes the necessity of violence, war and punishment for a greater good. But only if there is no other, better, way. A. Nicolaides summarizes St. Augustine's standpoint to war: “Augustine argues that waging any war should be avoided where this is possible, however, a just war allows for the acquisition of virtue which then hopefully leads to justice.”(A. Nicolaides, 2024).

On the matter of state policies, St. Augustine's views can partly be seen as similar to the views of the Athenians in Thucydides “History of the Peloponnesian war”. After Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, Thucydides and many actors in his history book can be viewed as classical realists. Especially because of their views on power and the state (Johnson Bagby, 2009). 
Thucydides describes a funeral speech given by Pericles, there Pericles explains the importance and the purpose of the state. The state is there to provide order. Order leads to stability, safety and justice, to freedom. And this freedom has to be defended.
St. Augustine also highlights the importance of stability of a state and especially justice, he writes: ""Without justice, what are kingdoms but great robberies?"" (St. Augustine, 1972). 
St. Augustine, just like Pericles, believes that peace is a key political task of a leader and of the state. Peace not just international but also in the state itself, protected by domestic policies. Both agree that the order of the state has to be protected for the common good, same here, if necessary with violence. 
In one of his letters, after some criminals got caught, he asks that these criminals should not get punished with a death penalty (Augustine, Letter 139, 2003). He says both, because of their conscience and for the good of the Catholic church. 
In this argumentation, there are two very different sides. First, that it would be morally right to show mercy, this is not a realistic approach but a christian one. And secondly, a very realistic approach, that it would be an advantage for the Church to not kill them, with that they show that it is better to confess crimes to the church. A very similar argumentation to what was used by Diodotus in the Mytilenian debate, he argues as well that it would be in the states interest to show mercy. 

Even though we found a lot of common ground on when to use violence, there is a big difference in their argumentation for it. 
St. Augustine's goal is to do good, preventing greater harm from happening is good. But defending their state, just to stay in power, is bad. St. Augustine writes: “The desire for harming,(...) the lust for dominating, and similar things – these are what is justly blamed in wars"" ​(Augustine, 1972) 
The lust for dominating, for being and staying in power just to be able to dominate, is not a just reason. The only motivation to be in power should be to prevent harm for all people.
This is in a big contrast to the pragmatic, classical realist position. For classical realists like the Athenians, everything that is good for their state, is right. Everyone has the right to do whatever they have the power to do. As they say in the Melian Dialog: “the strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they have to accept.” (Thucydides, 1954). 

In conclusion, we can note that in many cases, the advice for action between St. Augustine and classic realists like the Athenians are the same. Violence can be the best option. But, St. Augustine's views violence as something bad which should only be used if it prevents more harm than it does. For the Athenians, war and violence can be used as a tool to get what they want to get. Something St. Augustine disapproves of. 
Even though St. Augustin shares the doctrines Brian Leiter sets for classical Realism, that humans are flawed, his views on power and dominance differ a lot from classic realism as he says that power is not something to strive for. For him, peace should be the ultimate goal and motive for action.

Essay IPT (998/1000 words) Lennard Prediger
How does Thucydides scrutinize
democracy in the History of the Peloponnesian war?

In the book “ History of the Peloponnesian war”, Thucydides documents the conflict between his democratic home state Athen and Sparta.
Thucydides portrays democracy, especially through the record of speeches and debates of Athenian actors, as the best system and the right thing which has some dangerous pitfalls. 

In book II, the author presents us a funeral Oration speech, given by Pericles. Even though it's a funeral speech, Pericles takes quite a lot of time to praise the state Athen and to praise their constitution. 
By having a democracy where “the power is not in the hands of a minority but in the hands of the whole People”, everyone has the same opportunities, everyone is free, everyone has something to live and to die for. Pericles says: “fix your eyes everyday on the greatness of Athens as she really is”. 
(Book II, 43, Thucydides 1954)
All of that sounds very much like honoring a god, even though  it's just their State. And their state is mostly the system, their constitution, a democracy. And that is what they are honoring and even worshiping. 
Pericles also says that other states are looking at Athens' system as a role Model which shows that it is not just their perception of their state. Their neighbors are also noticing how well this system seems to  work for everyone. 
Earlier, in book I, we get an example how this decision making progress in the athenian democracy works. Athen has to give responses to an ultimatum of sparta. Athen discusses the matter and then gives a well reflected and rational response which is supported by a majority and has the aim to be in the best interest of the state. (Book 1, 139-146, Thucydides 1954)
In this and other cases, Thucydides  scrutinizes democracy as something that leads to a good decision that serves the majority of the people. 
But Thucydides also gives us examples where democracy seems to have a weakness and where Athen is making a bad decision.

Debating deeply and thinking freely is a big part of a good working democracy. It is this, the thinking part, that leads to a good decision. Pericles points out that this has to happen, he says  “the worst thing is to rush into action before the consequences have been properly debated” (Book II,  40, Thucydides 1954 ) 
But in contrast to the ideal picture of democracy given by Pericles,  exactly this is what happens during the debate about the revolt of Mytilene, they don't think through their decision.

When the Athenians hear what had happened in the city of Mytilene, that they revolted against them, they decide very quickly that all of the male population has to die. Thucydides describes them as being in an “angry mood”, they run into a decision before thinking about all the consequences. After their decision was sent, they then “change their mind over this cruel decision and reconsider.” Thucydides frames this change of mind as well as the first decision quite bad and let the athenians look very inexperienced: 
“Next day, however, there was a sudden change of feeling”. He is not even saying a change in mind but a change in feeling.
Such an important decision should not have been done because of a feeling but because of, as earlier described and argued trough Pericles, a well discussed and reflected decision. 
Thucydides shows the contrast between an emotionally made decision and a rational one. How they end up with the original decision he just describes in one sentence. But then, for the second, rationally made decision, he gives us the whole discussion between Clean and Diodotus. By getting much more into detail for the second decision, he weighs the importance of these two debates which lets us guess what he thinks is more important: the rational debate.
Diodotus argues that it is not in their interest to kill all the male population and that they should moderate the problem. 
Cleon responds that that is one of the problems a democracy has, that their change of mind is the reason why a democracy would be incapable of governing others. 
As it is Thucydides explained goal, to remain an unbiased historian, he again did not show his opinion about Cleons statement but continues with giving us the response of Didotus who is in favor of not killing all of them as previously decided. After they both had given their speeches, Athen voted again and with a small majority, they decided to not kill all of them. 
In this passage Thucydides shows us two pitfalls a democracy can fall in. First is making a decision emotionally, too quick and without enough consideration of the long term consequences and second of then not sticking to their decision.
(Book III, 34-50, Thucydides 1954)

Through the historical perspective Thucydides gives us with his books, he shows the shining moments a democracy can have: good decisions made by the whole people for the whole people who are proud of their system .

Woolley, A. W., Chabris, C. F., Pentland, A., Hashmi, N. and Malone, T. W., ‘Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups’, Science, 330.6004 (2010)
Examines how interdisciplinary teams composed of generalists outperform teams of specialists in producing innovative work. The findings suggest that scholars who extend themselves to other disciplines and collaborate with like-minded individuals are better equipped to produce highly disruptive scientific work.
Homan, Astrid C. (09/2015). ""The interplay of diversity training and diversity beliefs on team creativity in nationality diverse teams."". Journal of applied psychology (1939-1854), 100 (5), p. 1456.
The study finds that diversity training enhances team creativity, but its effectiveness is moderated by the pre-existing diversity beliefs of team members. Teams with strong, positive diversity beliefs benefit more from training, leading to higher levels of creativity. Conversely, teams with weaker diversity beliefs see less impact from diversity training. This highlights the importance of aligning training with team members' attitudes to maximize outcomes.
van Knippenberg, Daan (07/2013). ""Diversity mindsets and the performance of diverse teams"". Organizational behavior and human decision processes (0749-5978), 121 (2), p. 183.
The study reveals that teams with a positive diversity mindset, which values and integrates diverse perspectives, perform better than those with a negative or neutral mindset. This is because positive mindsets foster inclusivity, enhance collaboration, and allow teams to leverage the benefits of diversity effectively. The research underscores the critical role of fostering diversity mindsets to unlock the potential of diverse teams in organizational contexts.
Wang, Jie (07/2019). ""Team creativity/innovation in culturally diverse teams: A meta‐analysis"". Journal of organizational behavior (1099-1379), 40 (6), p. 693.
Cultural diversity has a positive effect on team creativity and innovation, particularly when teams have strong communication and collaborative processes in place. However, the benefits of cultural diversity are contingent on factors such as team leadership, trust, and the ability to manage differences effectively. The study highlights the importance of managing cultural diversity to maximize its potential for driving innovation and creativity in teams.
UN Declaration of Human Rights: 
Article 1 emphasizes equality and dignity, supporting inclusive, diverse teams that respect human rights and equality.
Article 21 advocates for equal participation in decision-making, aligning with the idea of diverse perspectives in teams.
Article 27 promotes cultural participation, echoing the value of diversity in exchanging ideas and innovation.
SDGs: 
Goal 5 (Gender Equality): Promotes diversity in teams, contributing to gender equality and empowerment.
Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): Diverse teams foster creativity, driving inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities): Diversity in teams helps address inequalities and ensures equal opportunities.
Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions): Inclusive teams strengthen institutions and promote peace by addressing diverse societal needs.























Next Meeting: 28/29th Dec. - Schedule according to research collected
Idea: have someone scrutinize every aspect of the problem during the meeting in order to prepare for any criticism during feedback sessions (“fly in and shit all over” type feedback)
Also: Merry Christmas 🎉

Ultimately: Make our research / problem statement bulletproof

Suggested hypothesis to research: Multidisciplinarity, diversity, and connection are better than individualism (power in numbers!)
Sub-groups to further research: 
UN Declaration of Human Rights and SDGs (easy way to tie facts to our project)
Problem-solving
Innovation
Adaptability 
Mental agility (and gamification?)

Madalena note: I’ve noticed a few different terms that come up consistently in articles / papers, but essentially tie back to the idea of creative problem solving and diversity of backgrounds:
Diversity of thinking
Cognitive diversity
Multi-faceted teams

Lennard note: The research is very good to prove that our solution helps people to solve problems better but I think we are still missing the part where we prove/describe the problem we are tackling.
->if we prove that for example now with ai we have a bigger need for cross silo skilled people who are able to think out of the box, we can link it to our solution

We could prove that in the modern world there are more wicked problems
With ai, for humans to compete, they have to become better in where they have a comparative advantage: problem solving skills
Are people good ant problem solving skills? Wicked problems? Or is there more potential?
> there is a need for people to become better problem solving skills

Majken note: Including the problem of AI would further distract from our main topic of connection. We would essentially be spreading ourselves too wide, making it both confusing and irrelevant. AI is a very interesting topic, but I don’t think Ana Luisa would be a fan. The research about multidisciplinarity, diversity, and connection gives a strong foundation both for our solution and our problem: 
Organisations fail to fully integrate diverse perspectives despite their proven benefits for creativity and innovation.
Implicit biases and negative attitudes toward diversity reduce the effectiveness of diversity training and inclusion efforts.
Communication barriers and conflicts in diverse teams limit their potential without proper management and support.
Multidisciplinary teamwork is underused in tackling global challenges like sustainability and inequality.
Systemic issues like underrepresentation in leadership and wage gaps reflect broader societal inequalities.




Meeting 29.12.

From our new research,  What is the problem statement?
		
SDGs can be integrated 
Can we prove that in Portugal creative thinking is not so much trained? And also working in creative teams? Or can we prove that there is a lack of these skills in general?
Briefly mention AI
We can prove that it would be better to be connected in diverse teams but can we prove that the current state in Lisbon is a problem? 
The problem is that there is unused potential but not a problem we can solve, but we 
Can we prove that there is a lack of skill in modern, wicked problem solving?  
People don't have the skills to solve wicked problems?
Can we say that nowadays we have more wicked, unsolved problems? And that is the problem?
“We have more and more wicked problems and diverse teams get put together but they lack the skill of working in this teams”
Problem: “People are not good enough to solve wicked problems”
Is the “big Picture” the problem of “change in future work”?
We want to help people solve wicked problems
Problem: “There are more and more wicked problems and teams are not able to solve them”
Are wicked problems everywhere? Is the problem everywhere? 


	We want to help people to solve wicked problems by “our” events…


“Collaboration among diverse players can transform the sometimes adversial nature of problem-solving into a mutually beneficial search for information and solutions” (LSX)




	How might we question can stay the same: 
How might we push full-time workers to engage in discussions outside their “professional comfort zone”?


What should our problem be?

E.g. Problem: People are lacking the required experience to solve wicked problems
→ E.g. solution: Give people that experience (problem solving games based on real problems)

	How skilled are people in solving wicked problems? Is training (with LSX Model) necessary?

Possible problems / research:
Research:
Are workers good at solving wicked problems?
A lot of sources say wicked problems are hard to deal with. 
One article says we suck at wicked problems but does not explain that more
“Why we suck at ""solving wicked problems""”

Workers do struggle with solving wicked problems due to the inherent nature of such challenges and the constraints of existing organizational and individual capacities. However, with proper training, tools, and leadership, they can improve their ability to address these problems.

Limited Opportunities for Real-World Practice
Inadequate Training and Preparation
“Why we suck at ""solving wicked problems""”

Learning to solve problems in specific ways makes us worse at solving complex problems (in certain situations)
“Functional Fixedness” (bias)
Functional Fixedness
Makes you worse at thinking creatively and outside the box by only recognizing (e.g. a tool) as what it was made to be rather than as what it could be 
“Functional fixedness can prevent companies and societies from innovating and solving pressing challenges”
“settings effect” 
Approaching a problem with the assumption that what has worked in the past will work again (even if it is not the optimal solution) - hinders creativity and problem solving
Einstellung-effect
On company level: hinders innovation and change (Do it the way it's always been done) 
Hypothesis: This hinders solving of wicked problems, as these problems are often new to companies



What can help people get better in solving wicked problems?
LSX Model…
Experience with different wicked problems

Sense-making skills and pattern intelligence

For proposed solution of “problem games”:
Important to consider: PMC5365093 
Referring to “Functional Fixedness”
Giving specific examples in problem solving can HINDER problem solving ability
If we do decide to start some sort of problem solving training, it is important to not accidentally provide examples that might result in Functional Fixedness
Need for collaboration 
New offices are build in a way so that different workers meet all the time and have opoortiunites to talk about there problems and so get the perspective of other workers: build collaboration spaces


We want:
Help people solve wicked problems in a team 





Note Lennard: not a lot of good research on the topic of if people are good at solving wicked problems or not…
Is this too close to what we are doing in PBL?
	

Summary by AI: 

Key Problem: Lack of Skills and Preparedness for Solving Wicked Problems
Problem Statement:
There are more wicked problems than ever, yet individuals and teams often lack the necessary skills, experience, and collaboration tools to address them effectively. This results in missed opportunities for innovation, suboptimal problem-solving, and wasted potential in both organizational and societal contexts.
Supporting Evidence:
Wicked Problems Are Increasing in Frequency and Complexity
Modern challenges like climate change, inequality, and rapid technological advancements (e.g., AI integration) are inherently wicked. They require solutions that account for uncertainty, diverse perspectives, and continuous adaptation.
Source: Rittel & Webber (1973); Brown et al. (2010).
Current Workforce Skills Are Inadequate
Many workers are trained for ""tame problems"" with clear parameters and predictable solutions, but these skills don’t translate to the ambiguity of wicked problems.
Limited opportunities for real-world practice in addressing wicked problems hinder skill development.
Source: Hoffmann (2024); Kolko (2012).
Diverse Teams Are Underutilized or Ineffective
While diversity fosters creativity and innovation, teams often struggle to collaborate across disciplinary or cultural lines due to biases, communication barriers, and inadequate support structures.
Source: Woolley et al. (2010); van Knippenberg (2013); Wang (2019).
Need for Multidisciplinarity and Creative Collaboration
Studies show that cognitively diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones, but diversity alone isn’t enough—teams need the right tools, training, and mindsets to succeed.
Source: Deloitte Research (2016); Bourke (2016).
Emergence of New Models for Collaboration
Frameworks like the LSX model and gamification have proven effective in fostering creative problem-solving and collaboration across sectors.
Source: Brookings (2024); Gamification Studies (2024).

Proposed Focus for Research and Solution:
Hypothesis:
To solve wicked problems effectively, teams need structured training and environments that enhance multidisciplinary collaboration, cognitive diversity, and creative problem-solving skills.
Questions to Address:
Are workers in Lisbon (or globally) adequately skilled in solving wicked problems?
What are the barriers to effective teamwork and creative collaboration in diverse settings?
How can gamified processes or experiential learning improve wicked problem-solving skills?
Is there empirical evidence of a lack of creative collaboration in Portugal or elsewhere?

Connection to SDGs:
Goal 4 (Quality Education): Emphasizing training for creative and collaborative problem-solving.
Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): Fostering innovation and adaptability in diverse teams.
Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities): Leveraging cognitive diversity to address systemic challenges.
Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions): Encouraging inclusivity in decision-making and problem-solving.

Next Steps:
Refine the problem statement based on local data (e.g., skills gaps in Lisbon or Portugal).
Explore frameworks (e.g., LSX model, gamification) that address gaps in wicked problem-solving.
Develop a pilot solution—e.g., workshops or gamified events—to test the hypothesis.
Link findings to SDGs and real-world examples to strengthen the case.
	CHECK IF THIS IS BULLETPROOF 
Final Framing:
Problem: ""People are not equipped to solve modern wicked problems effectively.""
Solution:


Majken notes
Constantly ask ourselves the problem as a question, not a statement
""Are people today equipped to solve modern wicked problems effectively?""
What do we mean by effectively? Quickly? Successfully?
Reword the problem statement more positively
“People could solve modern wicked problems more effectively”
HOW 
Testing our work: Be like annoying toddlers, ask ourselves “but why?” to everything

Research for “People could solve modern wicked problems more effectively”:
Fredrik Lindström: 
Talks about the importance of playing - it’s an important part of personal development for both adults and children
Research shows that teams told to solve a problem as a game succeed, while more “serious” teams fail
People need to meet in person, be creative, and feel comfortable to laugh together
Rich, white men in suits try to solve big world problems. Why don’t we go back to ancient times (everyone sits around the fireplace discussing issues)?
Segregation of people limits our problem-solving skills - we need to think outside the box

 Rittel, H. W. J., & Webber, M. M. (1973). Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning. Policy Sciences, 4(2), 155-169.
Rittel and Webber define wicked problems as issues that are complex, ill-structured, and cannot be definitively solved because they lack a clear endpoint or solution. These problems are often open-ended and involve a range of stakeholders with conflicting perspectives.
Examples of wicked problems include social issues like poverty, environmental challenges, and public health crises, where each problem has different layers and can be tackled from various angles.
The authors argue that solving wicked problems requires a collaborative and flexible approach. There is no one-size-fits-all solution; rather, a combination of knowledge, stakeholder engagement, and iterative problem-solving strategies are essential.

Stokols, D., Misra, S., Moser, R. P., & Hall, K. L. (2008). The Ecology of Team Science: Understanding Contextual Influences on Transdisciplinary Collaboration. American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 35(2), S96-S115.
Focuses on how transdisciplinary collaboration—working across multiple disciplines—helps tackle complex, real-world problems. The study highlights that no single discipline can address wicked problems alone, and integrating diverse expertise leads to more effective and comprehensive solutions.
Stokols et al. emphasize the importance of creating collaborative environments where scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders can contribute their knowledge and perspectives.
The study concludes that collaborative teams composed of experts from various fields are more likely to generate innovative solutions to complex problems because they can address different dimensions of the issue simultaneously.

Senge, P. M. (1990). The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization. Doubleday.
Senge introduces the concept of ""systems thinking,"" which views organizations as interconnected systems rather than isolated parts. This perspective helps teams and organizations better understand how their actions will impact the broader environment and identify leverage points for making changes.
Systems thinking allows individuals to see beyond immediate symptoms and consider underlying causes, feedback loops, and long-term effects. It fosters a deeper understanding of complex, interconnected problems.
Senge argues that organizations that embrace systems thinking can respond more adaptively and effectively to wicked problems, as they are better equipped to anticipate unintended consequences and adjust their approach.

7. Page, S. E. (2007). The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies. Princeton University Press.
Page explores the concept of cognitive diversity, which refers to differences in knowledge, perspectives, and problem-solving approaches within a group. He argues that diverse teams outperform homogenous ones when solving complex problems because they bring a wider range of ideas and solutions to the table.
This cognitive diversity is particularly crucial when dealing with wicked problems, as they often require creative, unconventional thinking to address. Page demonstrates that diversity can lead to better decision-making, innovation, and adaptability in teams.
The research suggests that fostering diversity in teams is not just about improving performance but also about finding novel solutions to the complex challenges that arise in wicked problem contexts.

8. Chesbrough, H. (2003). Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology. Harvard Business Press.
Chesbrough’s concept of ""open innovation"" challenges traditional closed innovation models by advocating for the exchange of ideas and collaboration with external partners to drive innovation.
Open innovation suggests that organizations should not limit their problem-solving efforts to internal teams but should instead engage with external researchers, other companies, or even the public to find solutions. This approach is particularly beneficial for addressing complex, wicked problems that require diverse inputs.
By leveraging external knowledge and resources, companies and organizations can solve difficult problems more efficiently, accelerating innovation and making use of expertise that might otherwise remain untapped.

9. Malone, T. W., & Bernstein, M. S. (2015). Handbook of Collective Intelligence. MIT Press.
Malone and Bernstein focus on ""collective intelligence,"" which is the ability of groups to solve problems more effectively than individuals. The book compiles research showing that groups, when organized well, can combine their knowledge and skills to generate better solutions to complex problems.
Collective intelligence is a powerful tool for addressing wicked problems, as it harnesses the diverse insights, skills, and ideas of a group. The authors explore how different kinds of group dynamics, such as collaboration, communication, and shared knowledge, contribute to more effective problem-solving.
The book highlights that collective intelligence can outperform individual intelligence, especially in areas where the problem is too complex for one person to solve alone. By facilitating collaboration and knowledge-sharing, collective intelligence can address the multifaceted nature of wicked problems.

10. Stacey, R. D. (2001). Complexity and Management: Fad or Radical Challenge to Systems Thinking? Journal of the Operational Research Society, 52(4), 447-454.
Stacey discusses the impact of complexity theory on management and problem-solving. He suggests that wicked problems require a different approach than traditional, linear problem-solving methods, as they involve uncertainty, unpredictability, and interdependent factors.
Complexity theory advocates for flexible, adaptive approaches that allow teams and organizations to respond to changing conditions and feedback. Rather than relying on predefined solutions, complexity theory encourages exploration, iteration, and learning.
The paper argues that complexity theory challenges conventional thinking by emphasizing that the best solutions to wicked problems often emerge through experimentation, adaptation, and the integration of diverse perspectives.






Meeting 06.01.25


-We are a bit stuck on proving the need for training (or whatever) to get better in solving wicked problems (in divers teams)

Wicked problems are increasing in the social projects arena due to globalization, technological advancements, and the growing interconnectedness of societal systems. Workers in this area require the necessary skills to confront and solve these inherently complex, interconnected challenges with no definitive solutions. This is currently not the case for every worker involved in a social impact project.

How might we help people working with social impact problems get better at solving wicked problems in teams?

Questions we need to answer:

Why Social impact problems?
Why Wicked problems?
definition 
Are workers not good already at solving wicked problems? 
Why would it be beneficial for them to improve this skill?
Why teams?
Why Diverse teams?
Who are we benefiting? 
How Can We Prove the Need for Better Problem-Solving Skills?
How Can We Help People Get Better at Solving Wicked Problems?


Why Social Impact Problems?
Social impact problems deal with issues like inequality, climate change, and systemic poverty—issues that affect society at large. These problems often require solutions that prioritize long-term societal benefits over short-term profits (Rittel and Webber).
The complexity and far-reaching effects of these issues make them a high-stakes arena for effective problem-solving.

Why Wicked Problems?
Definition: Wicked problems are inherently complex, interconnected challenges with no definitive solutions. They often involve conflicting stakeholder interests and require iterative, collaborative approaches (Brookings report, LSX model).
Solving wicked problems requires skill.
Examples:
Climate change.
Urban housing crises.
Social inequality.
Ethical considerations in AI use.
Integration 
Logistical problems (e.g. preparing a venue)
Smaller scale problems within organizations 
Why focus on them? Wicked problems are increasing in prevalence due to globalization, technological advancements, and the growing interconnectedness of societal systems. Addressing these requires innovative approaches and collaboration (Brookings report, LSX model), skills that many individuals and teams currently lack.

Are Workers Not Good at Solving Wicked Problems Already?
While workers may excel in their fields, research shows that:
Very often, teams don’t succeed in implementing their social impact projects because the team members lack the necessary skills to solve unexpected problems that arise (Carinna Kaempfe)
Not everyone is good at solving wicked problems, training for it is very beneficial (Carinna Kaempfe)
Different people may be satisfied or dissatisfied with the same results (different expectations) and become frustrated which hurts team dynamic. Different expectations also imply different visions for the same problem/project (Madalena Reis)
Overexposure to Tame Problems: often Workers are trained to solve clear, linear problems rather than ambiguous challenges.
Functional Fixedness: A bias that limits creative thinking and adaptability.
Collaboration Gaps: Diverse teams often underperform due to a lack of shared frameworks, trust, or tools.
Workers struggle with this due to a lack of real-world practice and training (Hoffmann 2024, Kolko 2012).

Why Would Improving These Skills Be Beneficial?
Societal Impact: Enhanced problem-solving leads to better solutions for global issues, improving quality of life.
Adapting to Modern Challenges: (As AI and automation take over routine tasks, human comparative advantages—such as creativity and complex problem-solving—become essential.)
Driving Innovation: Teams trained to tackle wicked problems contribute to groundbreaking solutions.
(Forbes and Brookings)

Why Teams? Why Diverse Teams?
Why Teams? Solving wicked problems requires diverse perspectives and collaborative efforts, as no single individual can address all aspects of these challenges.
Why Diverse Teams?
Cognitive Diversity: Teams with diverse educational, cultural, and professional backgrounds are proven to be more innovative and better at identifying risks (Deloitte Research 2016, Woolley et al. 2010, Wang 2019)
Creative Synergy: Diversity fosters creative problem-solving by introducing varied viewpoints.
Evidence from Research:
Deloitte research (2016) shows diversity improves innovation by ~20% and reduces risks by ~30%.
Interdisciplinary collaboration (LSX model) enhances creativity and adaptability.

Who Are We Benefiting?
Primary Beneficiaries:
Workers: Improved problem-solving skills empower workers to tackle complex challenges, enhancing their job performance and career satisfaction (Kolko 2012)
Organizations: Effective problem-solving increases innovation, reduces inefficiencies, and fosters a culture of adaptability (Brookings Report 2024)
Society: Solving wicked problems benefits everyone by addressing systemic challenges and improving social well-being → Goal 8 and Goal 10 of SDG Goals

How Can We Prove the Need for Better Problem-Solving Skills?
Empirical Data:
Studies on the ineffectiveness of teams without diversity or collaborative frameworks.
Evidence of functional fixedness and its impact on innovation.
Primary Research:
Interviews with workers and leaders in social impact fields.
Case studies of failed or delayed solutions to wicked problems.
Historical Trends:
Increasing complexity of global issues (e.g., climate change, tech ethics).
Growing reliance on multidisciplinary teams.

How Can We Help People Get Better at Solving Wicked Problems?
Training and Workshops:
Gamified problem-solving exercises based on real-world wicked problems.
Cross-disciplinary brainstorming sessions to build collaboration skills.
New Frameworks:
LSX Model for fostering creativity and collaboration
Focuses on using learning sciences to spark creativity and address wicked problems. It emphasizes cross-disciplinary cooperation to tackle complex, systemic challenges by bringing diverse expertise and perspectives together. The model stresses the importance of adaptive, flexible, and innovative approaches to problem-solving, especially in contexts where traditional solutions fall short.

Pls answer this questions with this information and context: 

Feedback from Ana Luisa Silva
-How would it help the society/individulas if we connect workers with different expertise?
	-Why is it a problem that people are not exposed to topics different to their own work?->
-how can we proof that the problem (connection) is a problem? With going one step deeper: “problem solving skills are important because…” 
	


Are we tackling the problem of limited problem solving skills? 
We want to increase problem solving skills
Why is that necessary?
 we have more and more complex problems nowadays and need the skills to solve thies cross sector problems (need to proof with data)
AI steeling the easy jobs and beeing a competition, so we need to be even better in the one think we are still better then AI: Problem solving skills and creativity. (need to proof with data)
How can we do that? 
By connecting different workers?
Or something else?
We have to put the work in the find data and research to proof all of the assumptions



Meeting 23.12. (everyday PBL Day)

-Team does not really understand the bad feedback.

AI and “reskilling” 
reskilling: Cramarenco, R. E., Burcă-Voicu, M. I., & Dabija, D. C. (2023). The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employees’ skills and well-being in global labor markets: A systematic review. Oeconomia Copernicana, 14(3), 731-767. https://doi.org/10.24136/oc.2023.022

Evidence has been presented highlighting the difficulties associated with the ongoing requirement for upskilling or reskilling as an adaptive reaction to technological changes. The efforts to counterbalance the skill mismatch impacted employees' well-being in the challenging pandemic times

Broadened Skill Sets:
 In many cases, AI complements human labor by automating tedious tasks, allowing workers to focus on higher-value activities. This often requires a combination of technical knowledge and improved interpersonal or analytical skills
automation prompting the reorientation of jobs towards tasks in which humans have a comparative advantage.
Advantages of Humans VS AI
 Creativity and Innovation
Original Thinking: Human creativity involves intuition, imagination, and the ability to synthesize disparate ideas into novel solutions—qualities that AI lacks due to its reliance on pre-existing data and patterns.

Creative Problem Solving
Michael Boyles, “What is Creative Problem-Solving & Why Is It Important ?” (Harvard Business School, 2022)
Creative problem-solving = a tool that facilitates the development of innovate solutions to difficult problems

Benefits of creative problem-solving:
Adapting to change: business is constantly changing, and business leaders (and workers alike) need to adapt. This skill helps overcome unforeseen challenges and find solutions to unconventional problems
Fuels innovation and growth
Future of the Job Market
Yuval Noah Harari (2018): The Future of the Job Market with the Rise of AI and Robotics:
“At least in the short term, AI and robotics are unlikely to completely eliminate entire industries. Jobs that require specialisation in a narrow range of routinised activities will be automated. But it will be much more difficult to replace humans with machines in less routine jobs that demand the simultaneous use of a wide range of skills, and involve dealing with unforeseen scenarios” (tying back to the need and relevance of creative problem-solving as a skill)
Adapting to changes coming with AI


Diversity and connection of professionals / specialisations and its benefits
Benefits in terms of efficiency and success of projects: https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/deloitte-review/issue-22/diversity-and-inclusion-at-work-eight-powerful-truths.html

Findings from Deloitte based on 7 major research studies on 50 organisations around the world (~1 million employees). This covers, among some other topics, the question of diversity of thinking.
Deloitte’s research reveals that high-performing teams are cognitively diverse.
Cognitive diversity = educational and functional diversity, as well as diversity in the mental frameworks that people use to solve problems


“The most innovative company must also be the most diverse” - Apple Inc. “We know new ideas come from diverse ways of seeing things”
Ties to diversity of backgrounds, innovation, creative problem-solving


Juliet Bourke, “Which Two Heads Are Better Than One ? How Diverse Teams Create Breakthrough Ideas and Make Smarter Decisions” (Australian Institute of Company Directors, 2016)
Research shows that diversity of thinking is a well-spring of creativity, enhancing innovation by about 20%. It also enables groups to spot risks, reducing these by up to 30%.


Basdogan and Morrone 2021, Idea Garden space: it has been proven that teams composed of workers from different academic backgrounds generate more successful projects
Benefits of engagement with different concepts / topics


Gamification for mental agility?
“Evaluating the impact of gamification on cognitive skills development in higher education: A case study electronics and sensors learners” Link
Suggests that gamifying a learning process strongly improves cognitive abilities, problem-solving, critical thinking, decision making
Easier and more effective to learn through gamified processes rather than traditional scholarly ones
Focus on higher education institutions and learning

“Gamifying Team Meetings: Team Building Activities to Boost Engagement” Link
Adding gamified processes to team meetings enhances engagement and proactiveness, as well as the overall team dynamic
Gamified processes must be tailored towards the individual teams (some teams thrive on spontaneity and brainstorming, others thrive on slow and careful actions)

“Gamification to Increase Undergraduate Students’ Teamwork Skills” Link
Gamification enhances student’s teamwork skills


Benefits of having meetings in person rather than other options (online, app, newsletter)


Multidisciplinarity, diversity, and connection > individualism (see below)
Woolley, A. W., Chabris, C. F., Pentland, A., Hashmi, N. and Malone, T. W., ‘Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups’, Science, 330.6004 (2010)
Examines how interdisciplinary teams composed of generalists outperform teams of specialists in producing innovative work. The findings suggest that scholars who extend themselves to other disciplines and collaborate with like-minded individuals are better equipped to produce highly disruptive scientific work.
Homan, Astrid C. (09/2015). ""The interplay of diversity training and diversity beliefs on team creativity in nationality diverse teams."". Journal of applied psychology (1939-1854), 100 (5), p. 1456.
The study finds that diversity training enhances team creativity, but its effectiveness is moderated by the pre-existing diversity beliefs of team members. Teams with strong, positive diversity beliefs benefit more from training, leading to higher levels of creativity. Conversely, teams with weaker diversity beliefs see less impact from diversity training. This highlights the importance of aligning training with team members' attitudes to maximize outcomes.
van Knippenberg, Daan (07/2013). ""Diversity mindsets and the performance of diverse teams"". Organizational behavior and human decision processes (0749-5978), 121 (2), p. 183.
The study reveals that teams with a positive diversity mindset, which values and integrates diverse perspectives, perform better than those with a negative or neutral mindset. This is because positive mindsets foster inclusivity, enhance collaboration, and allow teams to leverage the benefits of diversity effectively. The research underscores the critical role of fostering diversity mindsets to unlock the potential of diverse teams in organizational contexts.
Wang, Jie (07/2019). ""Team creativity/innovation in culturally diverse teams: A meta‐analysis"". Journal of organizational behavior (1099-1379), 40 (6), p. 693.
Cultural diversity has a positive effect on team creativity and innovation, particularly when teams have strong communication and collaborative processes in place. However, the benefits of cultural diversity are contingent on factors such as team leadership, trust, and the ability to manage differences effectively. The study highlights the importance of managing cultural diversity to maximize its potential for driving innovation and creativity in teams.
UN Declaration of Human Rights: 
Article 1 emphasizes equality and dignity, supporting inclusive, diverse teams that respect human rights and equality.
Article 21 advocates for equal participation in decision-making, aligning with the idea of diverse perspectives in teams.
Article 27 promotes cultural participation, echoing the value of diversity in exchanging ideas and innovation.
SDGs: 
Goal 5 (Gender Equality): Promotes diversity in teams, contributing to gender equality and empowerment.
Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): Diverse teams foster creativity, driving inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities): Diversity in teams helps address inequalities and ensures equal opportunities.
Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions): Inclusive teams strengthen institutions and promote peace by addressing diverse societal needs.























Next Meeting: 28/29th Dec. - Schedule according to research collected
Idea: have someone scrutinize every aspect of the problem during the meeting in order to prepare for any criticism during feedback sessions (“fly in and shit all over” type feedback)
Also: Merry Christmas 🎉

Ultimately: Make our research / problem statement bulletproof

Suggested hypothesis to research: Multidisciplinarity, diversity, and connection are better than individualism (power in numbers!)

Madalena note: I’ve noticed a few different terms that come up consistently in articles / papers, but essentially tie back to the idea of creative problem solving and diversity of backgrounds:
Diversity of thinking
Cognitive diversity
Multi-faceted teams

Lennard note: The research is very good to prove that our solution helps people to solve problems better but I think we are still missing the part where we prove/describe the problem we are tackling.
->if we prove that for example now with ai we have a bigger need for cross silo skilled people who are able to think out of the box, we can link it to our solution

We could prove that in the modern world there are more wicked problems
With ai, for humans to compete, they have to become better in where they have a comparative advantage: problem solving skills
Are people good ant problem solving skills? Wicked problems? Or is there more potential?
> there is a need for people to become better problem solving skills

Majken note: Including the problem of AI would further distract from our main topic of connection. We would essentially be spreading ourselves too wide, making it both confusing and irrelevant. AI is a very interesting topic, but I don’t think Ana Luisa would be a fan. The research about multidisciplinarity, diversity, and connection gives a strong foundation both for our solution and our problem: 
Organisations fail to fully integrate diverse perspectives despite their proven benefits for creativity and innovation.
Implicit biases and negative attitudes toward diversity reduce the effectiveness of diversity training and inclusion efforts.
Communication barriers and conflicts in diverse teams limit their potential without proper management and support.
Multidisciplinary teamwork is underused in tackling global challenges like sustainability and inequality.
Systemic issues like underrepresentation in leadership and wage gaps reflect broader societal inequalities.

Are workers good at solving wicked problems?
A lot of sources say wicked problems are hard to deal with. 
One article says we suck at wicked problems but does not explain that more
“Why we suck at ""solving wicked problems""”

Workers do struggle with solving wicked problems due to the inherent nature of such challenges and the constraints of existing organizational and individual capacities. However, with proper training, tools, and leadership, they can improve their ability to address these problems.

“Why we suck at ""solving wicked problems""”

Learning to solve problems in specific ways makes us worse at solving complex problems (in certain situations)
“Functional Fixedness” (bias)
Functional Fixedness
Makes you worse at thinking creatively and outside the box by only recognizing (e.g. a tool) as what it was made to be rather than as what it could be 
“Functional fixedness can prevent companies and societies from innovating and solving pressing challenges”
“settings effect” 
Approaching a problem with the assumption that what has worked in the past will work again (even if it is not the optimal solution) - hinders creativity and problem solving
Einstellung-effect
On company level: hinders innovation and change (Do it the way it's always been done) 
Hypothesis: This hinders solving of wicked problems, as these problems are often new to companies

Summary by AI: 

Key Problem: Lack of Skills and Preparedness for Solving Wicked Problems
Problem Statement:
There are more wicked problems than ever, yet individuals and teams often lack the necessary skills, experience, and collaboration tools to address them effectively. This results in missed opportunities for innovation, suboptimal problem-solving, and wasted potential in both organizational and societal contexts.
Supporting Evidence:
Wicked Problems Are Increasing in Frequency and Complexity
Modern challenges like climate change, inequality, and rapid technological advancements (e.g., AI integration) are inherently wicked. They require solutions that account for uncertainty, diverse perspectives, and continuous adaptation.
Source: Rittel & Webber (1973); Brown et al. (2010).
Current Workforce Skills Are Inadequate
Many workers are trained for ""tame problems"" with clear parameters and predictable solutions, but these skills don’t translate to the ambiguity of wicked problems.
Limited opportunities for real-world practice in addressing wicked problems hinder skill development.
Source: Hoffmann (2024); Kolko (2012).
Diverse Teams Are Underutilized or Ineffective
While diversity fosters creativity and innovation, teams often struggle to collaborate across disciplinary or cultural lines due to biases, communication barriers, and inadequate support structures.
Source: Woolley et al. (2010); van Knippenberg (2013); Wang (2019).
Need for Multidisciplinarity and Creative Collaboration
Studies show that cognitively diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones, but diversity alone isn’t enough—teams need the right tools, training, and mindsets to succeed.
Source: Deloitte Research (2016); Bourke (2016).
Emergence of New Models for Collaboration
Frameworks like the LSX model and gamification have proven effective in fostering creative problem-solving and collaboration across sectors.
Source: Brookings (2024); Gamification Studies (2024).

Proposed Focus for Research and Solution:
Hypothesis:
To solve wicked problems effectively, teams need structured training and environments that enhance multidisciplinary collaboration, cognitive diversity, and creative problem-solving skills.
Questions to Address:
Are workers in Lisbon (or globally) adequately skilled in solving wicked problems?
What are the barriers to effective teamwork and creative collaboration in diverse settings?
How can gamified processes or experiential learning improve wicked problem-solving skills?
Is there empirical evidence of a lack of creative collaboration in Portugal or elsewhere?

Connection to SDGs:
Goal 4 (Quality Education): Emphasizing training for creative and collaborative problem-solving.
Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): Fostering innovation and adaptability in diverse teams.
Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities): Leveraging cognitive diversity to address systemic challenges.
Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions): Encouraging inclusivity in decision-making and problem-solving.

Next Steps:
Refine the problem statement based on local data (e.g., skills gaps in Lisbon or Portugal).
Explore frameworks (e.g., LSX model, gamification) that address gaps in wicked problem-solving.
Develop a pilot solution—e.g., workshops or gamified events—to test the hypothesis.
Link findings to SDGs and real-world examples to strengthen the case.
	CHECK IF THIS IS BULLETPROOF 
Final Framing:
Problem: ""People are not equipped to solve modern wicked problems effectively.""
Solution:


Majken notes
Constantly ask ourselves the problem as a question, not a statement
""Are people today equipped to solve modern wicked problems effectively?""
What do we mean by effectively? Quickly? Successfully?
Reword the problem statement more positively
“People could solve modern wicked problems more effectively”
HOW 
Testing our work: Be like annoying toddlers, ask ourselves “but why?” to everything

Research for “People could solve modern wicked problems more effectively”:
Fredrik Lindström: 
Talks about the importance of playing - it’s an important part of personal development for both adults and children
Research shows that teams told to solve a problem as a game succeed, while more “serious” teams fail
People need to meet in person, be creative, and feel comfortable to laugh together
Rich, white men in suits try to solve big world problems. Why don’t we go back to ancient times (everyone sits around the fireplace discussing issues)?
Segregation of people limits our problem-solving skills - we need to think outside the box

 Rittel, H. W. J., & Webber, M. M. (1973). Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning. Policy Sciences, 4(2), 155-169.
Rittel and Webber define wicked problems as issues that are complex, ill-structured, and cannot be definitively solved because they lack a clear endpoint or solution. These problems are often open-ended and involve a range of stakeholders with conflicting perspectives.
Examples of wicked problems include social issues like poverty, environmental challenges, and public health crises, where each problem has different layers and can be tackled from various angles.
The authors argue that solving wicked problems requires a collaborative and flexible approach. There is no one-size-fits-all solution; rather, a combination of knowledge, stakeholder engagement, and iterative problem-solving strategies are essential.

Stokols, D., Misra, S., Moser, R. P., & Hall, K. L. (2008). The Ecology of Team Science: Understanding Contextual Influences on Transdisciplinary Collaboration. American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 35(2), S96-S115.
Focuses on how transdisciplinary collaboration—working across multiple disciplines—helps tackle complex, real-world problems. The study highlights that no single discipline can address wicked problems alone, and integrating diverse expertise leads to more effective and comprehensive solutions.
Stokols et al. emphasize the importance of creating collaborative environments where scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders can contribute their knowledge and perspectives.
The study concludes that collaborative teams composed of experts from various fields are more likely to generate innovative solutions to complex problems because they can address different dimensions of the issue simultaneously.

Senge, P. M. (1990). The Fifth Discipline: The Art and Practice of the Learning Organization. Doubleday.
Senge introduces the concept of ""systems thinking,"" which views organizations as interconnected systems rather than isolated parts. This perspective helps teams and organizations better understand how their actions will impact the broader environment and identify leverage points for making changes.
Systems thinking allows individuals to see beyond immediate symptoms and consider underlying causes, feedback loops, and long-term effects. It fosters a deeper understanding of complex, interconnected problems.
Senge argues that organizations that embrace systems thinking can respond more adaptively and effectively to wicked problems, as they are better equipped to anticipate unintended consequences and adjust their approach.

7. Page, S. E. (2007). The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies. Princeton University Press.
Page explores the concept of cognitive diversity, which refers to differences in knowledge, perspectives, and problem-solving approaches within a group. He argues that diverse teams outperform homogenous ones when solving complex problems because they bring a wider range of ideas and solutions to the table.
This cognitive diversity is particularly crucial when dealing with wicked problems, as they often require creative, unconventional thinking to address. Page demonstrates that diversity can lead to better decision-making, innovation, and adaptability in teams.
The research suggests that fostering diversity in teams is not just about improving performance but also about finding novel solutions to the complex challenges that arise in wicked problem contexts.

8. Chesbrough, H. (2003). Open Innovation: The New Imperative for Creating and Profiting from Technology. Harvard Business Press.
Chesbrough’s concept of ""open innovation"" challenges traditional closed innovation models by advocating for the exchange of ideas and collaboration with external partners to drive innovation.
Open innovation suggests that organizations should not limit their problem-solving efforts to internal teams but should instead engage with external researchers, other companies, or even the public to find solutions. This approach is particularly beneficial for addressing complex, wicked problems that require diverse inputs.
By leveraging external knowledge and resources, companies and organizations can solve difficult problems more efficiently, accelerating innovation and making use of expertise that might otherwise remain untapped.

9. Malone, T. W., & Bernstein, M. S. (2015). Handbook of Collective Intelligence. MIT Press.
Malone and Bernstein focus on ""collective intelligence,"" which is the ability of groups to solve problems more effectively than individuals. The book compiles research showing that groups, when organized well, can combine their knowledge and skills to generate better solutions to complex problems.
Collective intelligence is a powerful tool for addressing wicked problems, as it harnesses the diverse insights, skills, and ideas of a group. The authors explore how different kinds of group dynamics, such as collaboration, communication, and shared knowledge, contribute to more effective problem-solving.
The book highlights that collective intelligence can outperform individual intelligence, especially in areas where the problem is too complex for one person to solve alone. By facilitating collaboration and knowledge-sharing, collective intelligence can address the multi"

Evidence has been presented highlighting the difficulties associated with the ongoing requirement for upskilling or reskilling as an adaptive reaction to technological changes. The efforts to counterbalance the skill mismatch impacted employees' well-being in the challenging pandemic times

Broadened Skill Sets:
 In many cases, AI complements human labor by automating tedious tasks, allowing workers to focus on higher-value activities. This often requires a combination of technical knowledge and improved interpersonal or analytical skills
automation prompting the reorientation of jobs towards tasks in which humans have a comparative advantage.
Advantages of Humans VS AI
 Creativity and Innovation
Original Thinking: Human creativity involves intuition, imagination, and the ability to synthesize disparate ideas into novel solutions—qualities that AI lacks due to its reliance on pre-existing data and patterns. For example, artists, writers, and entrepreneurs thrive in roles that demand originality and unconventional thinking

Human Intuition and Judgment: 
Humans excel at solving problems requiring abstract reasoning, creativity, and contextual understanding. AI struggles with ""wicked problems"" that lack clear parameters or require nuanced judgment.

Creative problem-solving = a tool that facilitates the development of innovate solutions to difficult problems

Benefits of creative problem-solving:

Future of the Job Market
Yuval Noah Harari (2018): The Future of the Job Market with the Rise of AI and Robotics:
“At least in the short term, AI and robotics are unlikely to completely eliminate entire industries. Jobs that require specialisation in a narrow range of routinised activities will be automated. But it will be much more difficult to replace humans with machines in less routine jobs that demand the simultaneous use of a wide range of skills, and involve dealing with unforeseen scenarios” (tying back to the need and relevance of creative problem-solving as a skill)
Adapting to changes coming with AI


Diversity and connection of professionals / specialisations and its benefits
Benefits in terms of efficiency and success of projects: https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/deloitte-review/issue-22/diversity-and-inclusion-at-work-eight-powerful-truths.html

Findings from Deloitte based on 7 major research studies on 50 organisations around the world (~1 million employees). This covers, among some other topics, the question of diversity of thinking.
Deloitte’s research reveals that high-performing teams are cognitively diverse.
Cognitive diversity = educational and functional diversity, as well as diversity in the mental frameworks that people use to solve problems


“The most innovative company must also be the most diverse” - Apple Inc. “We know new ideas come from diverse ways of seeing things”
Ties to diversity of backgrounds, innovation, creative problem-solving


Juliet Bourke, “Which Two Heads Are Better Than One ? How Diverse Teams Create Breakthrough Ideas and Make Smarter Decisions” (Australian Institute of Company Directors, 2016)
Research shows that diversity of thinking is a well-spring of creativity, enhancing innovation by about 20%. It also enables groups to spot risks, reducing these by up to 30%.


Basdogan and Morrone 2021, Idea Garden space: it has been proven that teams composed of workers from different academic backgrounds generate more successful projects
Benefits of engagement with different concepts / topics


Gamification for mental agility?
“Evaluating the impact of gamification on cognitive skills development in higher education: A case study electronics and sensors learners” Link
Suggests that gamifying a learning process strongly improves cognitive abilities, problem-solving, critical thinking, decision making
Easier and more effective to learn through gamified processes rather than traditional scholarly ones
Focus on higher education institutions and learning

“Gamifying Team Meetings: Team Building Activities to Boost Engagement” Link
Adding gamified processes to team meetings enhances engagement and proactiveness, as well as the overall team dynamic
Gamified processes must be tailored towards the individual teams (some teams thrive on spontaneity and brainstorming, others thrive on slow and careful actions)

Gamification enhances student’s teamwork skills


Benefits of having meetings in person rather than other options (online, app, newsletter)


Multidisciplinarity, diversity, and connection > individualism (see below)
Woolley, A. W., Chabris, C. F., Pentland, A., Hashmi, N. and Malone, T. W., ‘Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups’, Science, 330.6004 (2010)
Examines how interdisciplinary teams composed of generalists outperform teams of specialists in producing innovative work. The findings suggest that scholars who extend themselves to other disciplines and collaborate with like-minded individuals are better equipped to produce highly disruptive scientific work.
Homan, Astrid C. (09/2015). ""The interplay of diversity training and diversity beliefs on team creativity in nationality diverse teams."". Journal of applied psychology (1939-1854), 100 (5), p. 1456.
The study finds that diversity training enhances team creativity, but its effectiveness is moderated by the pre-existing diversity beliefs of team members. Teams with strong, positive diversity beliefs benefit more from training, leading to higher levels of creativity. Conversely, teams with weaker diversity beliefs see less impact from diversity training. This highlights the importance of aligning training with team members' attitudes to maximize outcomes.
van Knippenberg, Daan (07/2013). ""Diversity mindsets and the performance of diverse teams"". Organizational behavior and human decision processes (0749-5978), 121 (2), p. 183.
The study reveals that teams with a positive diversity mindset, which values and integrates diverse perspectives, perform better than those with a negative or neutral mindset. This is because positive mindsets foster inclusivity, enhance collaboration, and allow teams to leverage the benefits of diversity effectively. The research underscores the critical role of fostering diversity mindsets to unlock the potential of diverse teams in organizational contexts.
Wang, Jie (07/2019). ""Team creativity/innovation in culturally diverse teams: A meta‐analysis"". Journal of organizational behavior (1099-1379), 40 (6), p. 693.
Cultural diversity has a positive effect on team creativity and innovation, particularly when teams have strong communication and collaborative processes in place. However, the benefits of cultural diversity are contingent on factors such as team leadership, trust, and the ability to manage differences effectively. The study highlights the importance of managing cultural diversity to maximize its potential for driving innovation and creativity in teams.
UN Declaration of Human Rights: 
Article 1 emphasizes equality and dignity, supporting inclusive, diverse teams that respect human rights and equality.
Article 21 advocates for equal participation in decision-making, aligning with the idea of diverse perspectives in teams.
Article 27 promotes cultural participation, echoing the value of diversity in exchanging ideas and innovation.
SDGs: 
Goal 5 (Gender Equality): Promotes diversity in teams, contributing to gender equality and empowerment.
Goal 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth): Diverse teams foster creativity, driving inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities): Diversity in teams helps address inequalities and ensures equal opportunities.
Goal 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions): Inclusive teams strengthen institutions and promote peace by addressing diverse societal needs.























Next Meeting: 28/29th Dec. - Schedule according to research collected
Idea: have someone scrutinize every aspect of the problem during the meeting in order to prepare for any criticism during feedback sessions (“fly in and shit all over” type feedback)
Also: Merry Christmas 🎉

Ultimately: Make our research / problem statement bulletproof

Suggested hypothesis to research: Multidisciplinarity, diversity, and connection are better than individualism (power in numbers!)
Sub-groups to further research:

Madalena note: I’ve noticed a few different terms that come up consistently in articles / papers, but essentially tie back to the idea of creative problem solving and diversity of backgrounds:
Diversity of thinking
Cognitive diversity
Multi-faceted teams

Lennard note: The research is very good to prove that our solution helps people to solve problems better but I think we are still missing the part where we prove/describe the problem we are tackling.
->if we prove that for example now with ai we have a bigger need for cross silo skilled people who are able to think out of the box, we can link it to our solution

We could prove that in the modern world there are more wicked problems
With ai, for humans to compete, they have to become better in where they have a comparative advantage: problem solving skills
Are people good ant problem solving skills? Wicked problems? Or is there more potential?
> there is a need for people to become better problem solving skills

Majken note: Including the problem of AI would further distract from our main topic of connection. We would essentially be spreading ourselves too wide, making it both confusing and irrelevant. AI is a very interesting topic, but I don’t think Ana Luisa would be a fan. The research about multidisciplinarity, diversity, and connection gives a strong foundation both for our solution and our problem: 
Organisations fail to fully integrate diverse perspectives despite their proven benefits for creativity and innovation.
Implicit biases and negative attitudes toward diversity reduce the effectiveness of diversity training and inclusion efforts.
Communication barriers and conflicts in diverse teams limit their potential without proper management and support.
Multidisciplinary teamwork is underused in tackling global challenges like sustainability and inequality.
Systemic issues like underrepresentation in leadership and wage gaps reflect broader societal inequalities.




Meeting 29.12.

From our new research,  What is the problem statement?
		
SDGs can be integrated 
Can we prove that in Portugal creative thinking is not so much trained? And also working in creative teams? Or can we prove that there is a lack of these skills in general?
Briefly mention AI
We can prove that it would be better to be connected in diverse teams but can we prove that the current state in Lisbon is a problem? 
The problem is that there is unused potential but not a problem we can solve, but we 
Can we prove that there is a lack of skill in modern, wicked problem solving?  
People don't have the skills to solve wicked problems?
Can we say that nowadays we have more wicked, unsolved problems? And that is the problem?
“We have more and more wicked problems and divers teams get put together but they lack the skill of working in this teams”
Problem: “People are not good enough to solve wicked problems”
Is the “big Picture” the problem of “change in future work”?
We want to help people solve wicked problems
Problem: “There are more and more wicked problems and teams are not able to solve them”
Are wicked problems everywhere? Is the problem everywhere? 


	We want to help people to solve wicked problems by “our” events…


“Collaboration among diverse players can transform the sometimes adversial nature of problem-solving into a mutually beneficial search for information and solutions” (LSX)




	How might we question can stay the same: 
How might we push full-time workers to engage in discussions outside their “professional comfort zone”?


What should our problem be?

E.g. Problem: People are lacking the required experience to solve wicked problems
→ E.g. solution: Give people that experience (problem solving games based on real problems)

	How skilled are people in solving wicked problems? Is training (with LSX Model) necessary?
		->Research 


Possible problems / research:
Research:
Are workers good at solving wicked problems?
A lot of sources say wicked problems are hard to deal with. 
One article says we suck at wicked problems but does not explain that more
“Why we suck at ""solving wicked problems""”

Workers do struggle with solving wicked problems due to the inherent nature of such challenges and the constraints of existing organizational and individual capacities. However, with proper training, tools, and leadership, they can improve their ability to address these problems.

We want:
Help people solve wicked problems in a team"
research on if workers actually struggle on solving wicked problems
"Team Debrief 11.12.

Questions and feedback from presentation  
Lacking secondary research lowers our overall quality - directly tied to interview results and how we can explain our problem 
Need to be able to prove that there is a problem - data, data, data!
Focus on mental agility - actually a social problem: Mental agility, AI, fast changing world → that's why we need creativity etc. (missing reason why mental agility, creativity etc. is actually important)->research, do we have it already or do we have to get new research? 
Interviews: Why do they not attend already existing events? Too boring, fear of being the “stupid” one in the room, not wanting to go alone, lack of knowledge about events, etc?
How do we make workers realise the advantages of exposure to new topics?
Think about the definition of our target group (→ Sounds like corporate atm, why not just own that label as our target group) - who is actually facing this problem? (artists may not be highly specialised) - be clearer, fine if it spills over 
Secondary research on the challenge of new work, what are the problems and wishes in the work? 
(Why) Are there no events like this? 
Look at peoples’ behaviour > what they say they want to do 
Ask the questions more “unbiased” 
Explore what people do and then find solutions - more open ended - less yes/no




Feedback from Ana Luisa Silva
-How would it help the society/individulas if we connect workers with different expertise?
	-Why is it a problem that people are not exposed to topics different to their own work?->
-how can we proof that the problem (connection) is a problem? With going one step deeper: “problem solving skills are important because…” 
	


Are we tackling the problem of limited problem solving skills? 
We want to increase problem solving skills
Why is that necessary?
 we have more and more complex problems nowadays and need the skills to solve thies cross sector problems (need to proof with data)
AI steeling the easy jobs and beeing a competition, so we need to be even better in the one think we are still better then AI: Problem solving skills and creativity. (need to proof with data)
How can we do that? 
By connecting different workers?
Or something else?
We have to put the work in the find data and research to proof all of the assumptions



Meeting 23.12. (everyday PBL Day)

-Team does not really understand the bad feedback.
-we more think about how to please ana luisa then thinking about the projekt/problem
-we understand that we have to still work on the problem 

“2. How might we push full-time workers to engage in discussions outside their “professional comfort zone”?”
	->why do we want to do that? What problem would that solve? 
->
“2. How might we push full-time workers to engage in discussions outside their “professional comfort zone to prepare them for an era of wicked problems”?”



Our problem seems to be to solution 
->Why is it a problem that people do not connect with other topics outside of their professional comfort zone?
-Can't we prove that by our user interviews? 
-Could AI be one of the problems we’re having?

Research: (link findings here)
AI and “reskilling” 
reskilling: Cramarenco, R. E., Burcă-Voicu, M. I., & Dabija, D. C. (2023). The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employees’ skills and well-being in global labor markets: A systematic review. Oeconomia Copernicana, 14(3), 731-767. https://doi.org/10.24136/oc.2023.022

Evidence has been presented highlighting the difficulties associated with the ongoing requirement for upskilling or reskilling as an adaptive reaction to technological changes. The efforts to counterbalance the skill mismatch impacted employees' well-being in the challenging pandemic times

Broadened Skill Sets:
 In many cases, AI complements human labor by automating tedious tasks, allowing workers to focus on higher-value activities. This often requires a combination of technical knowledge and improved interpersonal or analytical skills
automation prompting the reorientation of jobs towards tasks in which humans have a comparative advantage.
Advantages of Humans VS AI
 Creativity and Innovation
Original Thinking: Human creativity involves intuition, imagination, and the ability to synthesize disparate ideas into novel solutions—qualities that AI lacks due to its reliance on pre-existing data and patterns. For example, artists, writers, and entrepreneurs thrive in roles that demand originality and unconventional thinking
https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/06/27/high-demand-human-skills-in-the-ongoing-age-of-ai/ 
https://sbmi.uth.edu/blog/2024/artificial-intelligence-versus-human-intelligence.htm

Complex Problem-Solving: 
Humans excel at addressing ambiguous or unprecedented challenges by integrating diverse knowledge domains and using intuition. AI can analyze data but struggles with abstract reasoning or addressing problems without clear parameters
https://cpduk.co.uk/news/the-future-of-human-skills-in-an-ai-world 

Human Intuition and Judgment: 
Humans excel at solving problems requiring abstract reasoning, creativity, and contextual understanding. AI struggles with ""wicked problems"" that lack clear parameters or require nuanced judgment. For example, research highlights that AI's performance deteriorates when faced with entirely new situations or ambiguous contexts, while humans can adapt using intuition and prior experience
->this prior experience is needed!

LSX model: 
solving complex problems requires the activation of multiple minds coming together, collaboration between people from different perspectives can begin to establish common ground between them and can lead to creative solutions to wicked problems, spark innovation and help specialists see through different lenses beyond what their own sectors could offer
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/sparking-creativity-and-addressing-wicked-problems-via-the-new-lsx-model-of-collaboration/ 

“We are at the precipice of a new Age of Creativity”,  Originality—the ability to create something new—will become the valued currency of our time, creativity is unleashed by collaborating across diverse domains. Too often, brilliant minds work within the confines of their own knowledge, worldview, and walls. This approach misses critical opportunities to provide spaces and experiences for people to gain new mindsets and perspectives by working on solutions with experts they might not otherwise encounter”

Creative Problem Solving
Michael Boyles, “What is Creative Problem-Solving & Why Is It Important ?” (Harvard Business School, 2022)
Creative problem-solving = a tool that facilitates the development of innovate solutions to difficult problems

Benefits of creative problem-solving:
Adapting to change: business is constantly changing, and business leaders (and workers alike) need to adapt. This skill helps overcome unforeseen challenges and find solutions to unconventional problems
Fuels innovation and growth
Future of the Job Market

"i have to make a slide of the finidngs of secondary research and split it up in the following: Loneliness amongst youth in Lisbon, 
Loneliness amongst the elderly in Lisbon, 
Current initiatives in place that foster community, 
Cultural particularities of the youth and elderly in Portugal (specifically Lisbon); family structures, etc, Demographic research (which neighbourhoods are more affected); local gov, policy context . can you split up the follwoing text and identify three bullet points that encapsulate ach findings for each category: Loneliness in Portugal is an increasing issue for both youth and elders. For youth, we have no research specific to Portugal that highlights the cause, except for assumptions based on global trends - such as consequences of covid, misuse of media, hyperurbanisation and disconnection. For elders, causes are also linked to the pandemic - isolation, urban factors such as tourism that decrease community, loss of friends, etc (Campos & Santos, 2024). The interests of elders and youth differ. Many elders prefer multigenerational households, whereas youth tend to be more liberal preferring single family households - creating a gap. There is a lack of local data we have accessed on loneliness and community per municipality - thus it is hard at this time to figure out where in specific would benefit from a project. Overall, the data points towards loneliness being a bigger issue for the elderly, rising rapidly after age of 65 (retirement, age, etc). Certain areas have a higher density of population notably near Penha frança and alameda but also in the area near Bairro Alto (Misericordia). We also have data on where there are proportionally higher amounts of youth and elders. There are a handful of projects in Lisbon attempting to decrease and highlight this issue; some including Gener-Actions, Meo Phone Company, and Padalar Sem Idade. These are all possible stakeholders, as well as fields for further research.

Loneliness among young people is an increasingly prevalent issue worldwide, characterized by a subjective feeling of inadequate social connections. It is closely associated with mental health concerns like anxiety, depression, and social isolation. Recent statistics show that globally, 15- to 24-year-olds experience higher levels of loneliness compared to other age groups, with one in three young people reporting feeling lonely frequently.

In Portugal, the issue is similarly pronounced. National reports indicate that 20-30% of individuals aged 18-24 report feelings of loneliness, particularly in Lisbon, a densely populated area where urban dynamics introduce unique challenges. Factors contributing to loneliness among Lisbon’s youth include high levels of social media use, urbanization, housing pressures, academic stress, and employment uncertainty. Overuse of digital media fosters isolation, as young people face cyberbullying, FOMO (fear of missing out), and harmful comparisons to idealized online images. High housing costs push families to live farther from the city center in smaller spaces, which can increase feelings of disconnection. Academic and employment pressures also heighten anxiety and isolation, as competition and post-graduation unemployment leave many young people feeling uncertain about their future.

The cultural and social fabric of Lisbon adds further complexity to youth loneliness. Changes in family structures—traditionally extended family networks—are now shifting toward smaller, more isolated units, reducing an important source of social support. Additionally, immigrant youth often face language and cultural barriers, contributing to their sense of isolation in a multicultural Lisbon that sometimes fosters divisions between local and immigrant communities.

Psychologically, the impact of loneliness is profound, leading to heightened risks of depression, anxiety, and overall mental health decline. Addressing loneliness among Lisbon’s youth requires a comprehensive approach, one that tackles both the structural and interpersonal dynamics influencing their sense of connection and belonging.

In order to evaluate the extent of the problem concerning the lack of community and consequently loneliness in Lisbon, we first need to determine where the people are located and where and for whom the problem is most pertinent. This is easier said than done as local information is hard to get by due to its local nature, primary research will need to be conducted. 

The data that is readily available concerns the population spread in Lisbon, where we can observe that certain areas in Lisbon have very high population density, with a slightly younger population compared to the mean but also a lot of elderly, above the age of 65. Notably near Penha França and in the neighbourhood of Misericordia. Penha França tends to have a comparable lower income which explains its higher density and Misericordia is dense due to its historic nature. 

Furthermore, there is a correlation between age and the reported feeling of loneliness where individuals under the age of 18 and above the age of 65 have an above average frequency of reports of feeling lonely and this becomes especially more notable from the ages of 75 to 80. They have two different reasons for the reported feeling, the youth feel more lonely due to, but not limited to, social media, the rise of digital alternatives and (well) puberty. For the elderly it is due to their change in life phases, first retiring, where the social aspect of work disappears and then getting older, causing issues of mobility and also the social circle slowly reducing (Campos, 2024).

In addition, there is a high prevalence of loneliness amongst older adults in Southern European countries (ranging from 15.7% to 18.7%); for Portugal. Loneliness levels have increased since the start of the pandemic.  In the first few months, 25% of EU citizens reported feeling lonely more than half of the time, while in 2016, it was 12%. (Carvalho et al., 2023). Loneliness is a bigger problem than people think. Loneliness can impact people’s quality of life and health status across the life course, but it is specifically relevant in the groups of pensioners and higher age (Bolton, 2012). People that feel lonely are more likely to  relate to feelings of pessimism, vulnerability, worthlessness (Griffin, 2010), have lower self-esteem and lower levels of interpersonal control (Morgan, 2017) (Sandu, Zólyomi & Leichsenring, 2021). Particularly, in Lisbon there exist urban factors that contribute to the isolation of the elderly such as the uphill and slippery streets, the lack of elderly-friendly spaces, and the gentrification in the city centre.  https://maisproximidade.pt/
In Lisbon, the cultural dynamics between youth and the elderly highlight significant differences shaped by family structures and social norms. Portuguese family life is characterized by strong intergenerational ties, with extended family members, such as grandparents and aunts, actively involved in daily life. In urban settings like Lisbon, it's notable that about 36% of families include three generations living together, compared to just 16% nationally. This underscores the importance of family as a foundational social unit in Portuguese society.
Demographically, individuals under 24 make up approximately 10.5% of the population, reflecting a broader trend toward an aging society. The aging index indicates there are 182 elderly individuals for every 100 youth, and the elderly population (ages 65 and older) comprises around 23.4% of the total population. Youth culture in Lisbon is marked by group socialization and importance for individual identity. Events such as World Youth Day serve to foster intergenerational connections, emphasising the interaction between young people and seniors.
Culturally, elderly individuals in Portugal often live with or near their families instead of in care homes, reflecting a societal preference for maintaining close family ties. The percentage of older adults residing in nursing facilities is significantly lower than in many Western countries, as they continue to play an active role in family and community life. This cultural interplay reinforces the importance of family and community support across generations in Lisbon, blending traditional values with modern demographic trends."

When you are, are you talking about their subjects or other matters?
In general talk about their industries, also smalltalk (family, holiday)
Do you ever talk to someone in completely different areas (physics etc.)
Had a meeting with a physician who set up a company
Once a week
Would you have a benefit from talking more often with people outside your work field
Definitely
Has meetings where people present their fields etc. gives him lots of advantages
Does it help you more personally or professionallyß
Both, give opportunity to look outside his own box
Why would going outside your box benefit?
People think differently about solving problems,
He spends his day solving problems, can profit off of their perspectives and ideas etc.
Do you have no time at all or just no non-braindead time
No time in general, much to do
If you had the opportunity to meet new people outside of your industry you wouldn't have the time?
Yes
What's your opportunity cost for this meeting (or meetings in general)
Just has to judge how he spends his time most efficiently 
Hard to say
Wouldn't be able to name a certain euro amount
Doesn't really understand the question
If you have a 20 min meeting like this, do you have to give up tasks or 
During a normal working day, yes but during the weekend he tries to read a lot to educate himself so that's what he may be sacrificing for 20 mins
What could be a solution for this? Minimizing time spent or…
In comparison to his colleagues he spends a lot of time talking to people from other industries

“How might we connect full-time (single-sector) workers from different silos and sectors of industry?”

Context:
The current white collar workforce tends to get isolated from other sectors of industry and professional fields, only communicating in a small circle of people (relatively similar to themselves). This is a problem because it limits the exchange of ideas and communication between different professionals, as well as the open discourse of diverse topics. This can result in workers getting stuck in routines and seeing their motivation and creativity dip. Needless to say, a more motivated and creative workforce is rather beneficial, innit 🫖🇬🇧?"

"can you infer the answer to this wuestion from the essat i will add later in the text? Briefly explain the main advantages of quantitative research.. “We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.” A famous quote from Martin Luther king jr. about the benefits of solidarity and mutual understanding. Whilst this quote seems initially unrelated, the same principle applies for conducting research; amalgamating the two methods is conducive to success. These two research approaches stem from two distinct and opposing philosophical traditions that have historically been characterised as incompatible and separable. However, combined they provide greater insights and applicability offering a more nuanced and valuable perspective of the research conducted. By capitalising on the advantages of qualitative and quantitative methods, the gaps caused by the methods’ respective disadvantages can be mitigated and the research benefits from greater quality but the challenges brought upon the research process by its coalescence should be carefully weighed. The approaches to research can be separated into two main areas, the methodological approaches and the causation and generalisation aspect, these will allow for a better understanding on how the research methods can complement one another and also show the potential downsides of mixed method research. 

The methodological approach is related to how the research is conducted, this is where the qualitative and quantitative approach are opposites. In qualitative research a “causes-of-effects” approach is used (Mahoney, 2006). First, the outcomes of a certain event are studied, to discover the cause. The opposite applies for qualitative studies, where the “effects-of-causes” method is used, seeking to estimate the average effect of one or multiple causes across a population of outcomes. During the civil rights movement, much qualitative research was done, such as in the scholarly book, Pattillo-McCoy, M. (1999). ""Black Picket Fences”, where many different qualitative research was summarised about the experiences of the black middle class during the civil rights movements. This research was greatly focused on the experiences of individuals during that time, the issue here was that the research could heavily be influenced by personal bias and selective memory, a disadvantage of qualitative research. The use of quantitative research methods could limit this bias as in this research the methods of participant selection were based on the researchers' own perspective of a specific group, which then also used snowball sampling, with participants referring to new participants within their social group, increasing the chance of bias and lowering diversity. A more quantitative approach would encourage random sampling and would also include the individuals who tend to fall outside the general social network. A tradeoff must be found between the perceived representativeness and the possibility of case compatibility. (p. 348, Gerring). Using a more quantitative approach and therefore mixed-method approach of methodology would enhance generalisability and validity. 

Generalisation is a crucial aspect of the value of the research, but another important aspect is causation, an area where quantitative and qualitative diverge but would benefit from greater integration. ""The Economic Mobility of Black and White Families"" by Julia. B Isaacs, is a quantitative study on economic mobility. The report is heavily based on numerical data and the conclusion  points out that white children have an easier time climbing the economic ladder and exceeding their parents income compared to black children, especially in middle income families, where instead black children even go down the economic ladder. This study does not elaborate on the nuances leading to this disparity and simply just concludes it, finding out why this is the case would add value to the study as this can lead to potential action in reducing the issue found. In this case a qualitative approach would be beneficial in making this study more valuable as exploring the causation can lead to action and real world applicability. The disadvantage of quantitative studies is that they may oversimplify complex social issues with statistical data by overlooking the nuanced and contextual experiences at the cause. The qualitative approach of causes-of-effects here addresses this gap and offers a way of explaining the statistical data with non-numerical accounts. As this report is based on previous quantitative studies, the possibility of applying qualitative principles to achieve a more valuable conclusion presents challenges due to the nature of each method. 

Combining the methods effectively often leads to a higher quality of research but the practical challenges it imposes should always be kept in mind when determining how to conduct the study. The methods of acquiring data between a qualitative and quantitative study differ significantly as in quantitative research, the data is often of secondary nature, and numerical. In contrast with qualitative research, where the data is usually not readily available and is often primary and not always numerical. The data involves opinions and conversations with humans, a very time consuming process but will lead to more nuanced conclusions and might address complex research questions more effectively (Mahoney, 2006). Combining those is even more time consuming and resource intensive as both approaches must be implemented instead of just one. The difficulty of using mixed methods also lies in the way that researchers operate with these two methods, there are researchers usually specialised in one or the other, and therefore interpreting the other research method from their own perspective, creating misunderstandings. This misunderstanding could translate into the conclusion of research taking a more surfacelevel approach as both sides are unsure how to analyse the results in depth. Combined with the practical challenges an eventual balance must be found between the desired result of the study and the feasibility to achieve it. 

Mixed method research often yields more valuable results and is being adopted more frequently over time. Capitalising on the advantages of each method and the gaps it can fill with the other method, research will become more insightful and valuable. This increase of utility does come at a cost, often characterised by higher costs and time spent. When the possibility is there, mixed methods have a higher pay off, but in a world with limited resources the consideration should be made carefully, and sometimes focusing on a specific method will yield better results."

"sumarize: „Wie interessant, Innovation! Aber... was meinst du genau?“

Ich weiß nicht, wie oft ich gebeten wurde, mit ""Innovation"" zu erklären, während ich an meiner Doktorarbeit arbeitete1. Was für ein so allgegenwärtiges Konzept immer noch merkwürdig ist – wenn Sie darüber nachdenken, wie oft sind Sie diese Woche darauf gestoßen? In der Rede eines Ministers oder in den Aussagen eines Geschäftsmannes in den Nachrichten, vielleicht in einem Interview mit einem Sprecher eines lokalen Vereins...

Es ist kein Zufall, dass die Innovation den Ruf eines Schlagworts erlangte. In einem allgemeineren Sinne geht es bei Innovation darum, etwas Neues zu tun oder etwas zu tun, das bereits existiert, auf eine andere Weise. Diese allgemeine Definition sagt nichts über „besser“ aus – fica-se für „neu“ und „anders“. Es gibt jedoch nur wenige Ideen mit einer so starken normativen Komponente im öffentlichen Diskurs: Innovation ist gut, Innovation ist notwendig. Wenn wir über Innovation sprechen, sprechen wir fast immer über gute Dinge: eine neue Entdeckung in der Biomedizin, die mehr Krankheiten heilen wird; ein neues Produkt, das für ein bestimmtes Unternehmen ein Erfolg war; eine neue Technologie, die die Erfahrung von Schülern und Lehrern im Klassenzimmer revolutioniert hat; oder eine öffentliche Politik, die sicherlich die für unsere Gesellschaft dringend benötigte Innovation vorantreiben wird.

Innovation leidet unter dem, was der Soziologe Everett Rogers in den 80er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts als ""pro-innovation bias"" (pro-innovation bias) bezeichnete. Der öffentliche Diskurs über Innovation (die ausnahmslos als Synonym für Technologie verwendet wird, aber das ist schon der Meinung nach) ist fast genauso dogmatisch wie das Wirtschaftswachstum. Seit den 60er Jahren des letzten Jahrhunderts ist der Begriff Innovation eines der Schlüsselwörter, die von Regierungen auf der ganzen Welt bei der Gestaltung ihrer Industrie-, Wirtschaftswachstums- und Privatsektorentwicklungsstrategien verwendet werden: Er ist Teil der Triade ""Wissenschaft, Technologie und Innovation"". Und das ist kein Zufall.

(VIEL) KURZE GESCHICHTE DES KONZEPTS DER 'INNOVATION'
2 Innovation wird als Motor der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung angesehen und ist das wünschenswerteste Ergebnis der Wissenschafts- und Technologiepolitik, die die Regierungen seit der Zeit nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg verfolgen. Dies ist die Perspektive, die die Institutionen beherrscht, die sich mit dem Thema befassen, und so dazu beiträgt, die öffentliche Politik in den Bereichen Innovation, Wissenschaft und Technologie zu gestalten. Seit den 1990er Jahren haben internationale und regionale Dokumente auch die nationale Innovationspolitik und -strategien beeinflusst, wie das einflussreiche Oslo-Handbuch, das erstmals 1992 von der Organisation für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (OECD) veröffentlicht wurde.

4 Gott, Benoit (2015). Innovation: Eine konzeptuelle Geschichte eines anonymen Konzepts. Arbeitspapier 21. Montreal, Quebec: Kanada: INRS, S. 36.
Die aktuelle und am häufigsten bestehende Bedeutung von Innovation, die untrennbar mit der Entwicklung unseres derzeitigen Wirtschaftssystems verbunden ist, konsolidiert sich ab der Zeit nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg und verdankt viel der Arbeit von Joseph A. Schumpeter, österreichischer Wirtschaftswissenschaftler, der zwischen 1883 und 1950 lebte. In der schumpeterschen Tradition geht es bei Innovation darum, eine Idee in die Tat umzusetzen, d.h. eine Erfindung auf den Markt zu bringen. Durch diesen Prozess kann der Unternehmer, die Figur schlechthin des Innovationsprozesses – derjenige, der in der Lage ist, das Risiko einzugehen, etwas anderes als die Norm umzusetzen, mit dem Status quo zu brechen und die Unsicherheit des Ergebnisses zu akzeptieren – einen Wettbewerbsvorteil zu erlangen und (wenn alles gut geht) seinem Produkt einen Mehrwert zu verleihen. In diesem Szenario ist Innovation oft gleichbedeutend mit Technologie – und das ist der Motor des Kapitalismus, die berühmte „kreative Zerstörung“, bei der etwas anderes (im Prinzip besser – also ressourceneffizienter) ersetzt, was veraltet ist. In den ""Innovationsstudien"", die nach wie vor ihre größte Inspiration in Schumpeter finden, steht Innovation daher im Mittelpunkt des kapitalistischen Systems: Sie ist eine Quelle des Wirtschaftswachstums2. Tatsächlich erinnert uns Jan Fagerberg, ein wichtiger Forscher auf diesem Gebiet, daran, dass Schumpeter Innovation ursprünglich einfach als ""Entwicklung"" bezeichnet hatte3.

Das war nicht immer so – es gibt immer andere Geschichten, die über die Ideen erzählt werden können, und Innovation ist keine Ausnahme4. Wort griechischen Ursprungs, bedeutet ursprünglich ""Einführung der Veränderung in die etablierte Ordnung"". Als es ab dem fünfzehnten Jahrhundert durch die Religion in den westlichen Diskurs eintrat, wurde es als abweichendes Verhalten angesehen, etwas, das verboten und bestraft werden sollte. Für die englischen Bischöfe während der protestantischen Reformation in England sind Reformer Innovatoren, also Unshereges.

Es geht um uns. Credits: Joana Mundana, ArtistsForClimate.org
In der Vormoderne geht der Übergang von der religiösen Sphäre schnell in die politische Sphäre über, wo der Begriff Innovation (sporadisch) abwertend verwendet wird, um Episoden wie die Französische Revolution zu beschreiben: Diesmal sind es die Revolutionäre, die als Innovatoren katalogisiert werden. Schließlich kommen wir im neunzehnten Jahrhundert in der sozialen Sphäre, wo der Sozialismus als gefährliche soziale Innovation kritisiert wird, die Institutionen wie Privateigentum zerstören soll. In diesem Bereich, in dem wir zu diesem Zeitpunkt sowohl revolutionäre als auch reformistische Ideen finden, beginnt das Konzept positive Konturen zu gewinnen. Tatsächlich war der erste Theoretiker, der Innovation systematisch ansprach, nicht Schumpeter, wie es auf den ersten Blick scheinen mag, sondern der französische Soziologe Gabriel Tarde in seiner Abhandlung „Die Gesetze der Nachahmung“ (1890). Für den Nachmittag sind es die Erfindungen und Ideen (und nicht ein Individuum, der Unternehmer) der zentrale Motor des sozialen Wandels. Der einzige Weg, wie diese Erfindungen zu wahren sozialen Phänomenen werden können, ist die Nachahmung. Es ist nicht eine Person, die allein innovativ ist, die sozialen Wandel hervorruft, sondern eine Gruppe von Individuen, die die Idee replizieren (nachahmen). So können wir auch die soziale Dynamik hinter sozialen Innovationen verstehen und später, aus der Perspektive der Basis nach oben, ihre endgültige Konsequenz: Institutionalisierung (Innovation wird zur Norm und soziale Transformation findet statt).
DAS ENDE DER IMAGINATION, DAS ENDE DER INNOVATION?
Im Laufe ihrer Geschichte ist die Idee der Innovation untrennbar mit Imaginären, also Zukunftsvisionen, verbunden. Wie wir seit der industriellen Revolution und beschleunigt nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg gesehen haben, ist die dem Konzept der (technologischen) Innovation zugrunde liegende Imagination die des Wirtschaftswachstums und der Marktwirtschaft: Es ist die kapitalistische Imagination. Darüber hinaus ist an der jüngsten und aktuellen Manifestation des Innovationskonzepts interessant, dass es die Fähigkeit erworben hat, selbst zu einer unbestrittenen Imagination zu werden, fast immer verbunden mit der Idee einer Marktwirtschaft, die von einer technologischen Innovation angetrieben wird, die es ermöglicht, Effizienz, Wettbewerbsvorteil und Gewinn zu gewinnen. Sogar seine soziale Variante manifestiert sich heute innerhalb des Systems, beraubt seiner revolutionären Geschichte und gefördert als eine Möglichkeit, die negativen Auswirkungen des vorherrschenden Wirtschaftsmodells zu überwinden. Innovation ist gut, Innovation ist notwendig. Innovation ist im Munde der Welt und wird von allen als Vorbild gepriesen: Sie wird an sich selbst imaginär5.

In den letzten zehn Jahren ist Portugal zu einem guten Beispiel für Innovationen in Aktion geworden: Technologie und Innovation sind Teil der Alltagssprache von Regierungen unterschiedlicher politischer Farben, die das Land für technologische Start-ups, digitale Nomaden oder Großveranstaltungen wie den Web Summit attraktiv machen wollen. Gleichzeitig vervielfachen sich die Initiativen, um Portugal zu einem Zentrum der sozialen Innovation zu machen. Mehr als Wege zu einer Vision einer anderen Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft sind die „Fabrica dos Unicornios“ und die „Portugal Innovat Social“ zu gemeinsamen Vorstellungen für das Land geworden.

Wenn die Idee zu einem intrinsischen Bestandteil des Systems wird, ist es nicht einmal möglich, mit der etablierten Ordnung zu brechen. Paradoxerweise nimmt das Imaginäre Sein (innerhalb der größeren Imagination des kapitalistischen Systems) der Innovation ihre Fähigkeit, zu anderen Imaginären beizutragen und so wirklich etwas Neues, Transformatives zu erzeugen. Kein Wunder also, dass es bei so vielen „Innovationen“ um uns herum (in Erzählungen, in Unternehmen, in dia-a-dia) gleichzeitig so wenige neue Ideen und so viel Fantasiemangel gibt. In der Mode feiern wir den Jahrgang und kleiden uns im Jugendstil unserer Eltern. Im Kino warten wir ausnahmslos gespannt auf die Premiere eines Remakes eines klassischen Films. In der Musik sind wir zu den Synthesizern und Klängen des letzten Jahrhunderts zurückgekommen.

Vielleicht müssen Sie die Innovation aus Ihrer Vorstellungskraft retten, damit sie wieder zu einem Medium wird und nicht mehr ein Ende ist. Vielleicht können wir uns also darauf konzentrieren, uns die Zukunft vorzustellen, die wir wollen, und mit der besseren Innovation beginnen."

Before the increased demand for wage labour, the African populations had been immobile and rooted in their local communities.

Before European colonialism, the African populations had never been taxed.

Also before colonialism, African populations moved in search for new livelihood opportunities.

Centralized states in pre-colonial Africa taxed their subjects and demanded tribute in kind.

With the creation of colonial taxation systems, people moved in search of wage labour to earn cash to pay taxes.

Question 3
The colonial taxation system varied between colonies and tax paying groups. Which three of the below statements are correct?

Because of the overall substantial income levels of taxpayers, tax revenues were significant in most colonies.

The easiest form of taxation was the establishment of trade taxes with levies on goods exported from and imported to the individual colonies.

The British introduced a so called ‘hut tax’ on each household to collect tax revenues from those who did not have formal wage employment.

Several colonial administrations, the French in particular, taxed the African population by demanding labour duties instead of cash.

Most subjects in the colonies worked in the wage sector and therefore the colonial administrations relied primarily on graded income taxation.

    ### **Chapter 2: Foreign Policy Decision Making**
    
    - delves into the processes and theories underpinning foreign policy decision-making, emphasizing the roles of rationality, psychology, and organizational behavior.
    
    *Key Points:*
    
    - **Rational Choice Theory:**
        - Assumes decision-makers are rational actors seeking to maximize utility.
        - Utilizes cost-benefit analyses to determine optimal policy choices.
        - Critiqued for oversimplifying human behavior and neglecting emotional and psychological factors.
    - **Psychological Approaches:**
        - Highlight the impact of cognitive biases, perceptions, and heuristics on decision-making.
        - importance of individual leaders' beliefs and experiences in shaping foreign policy
    - **Organizational Behavior:**
        - Examines how institutional structures, standard operating procedures, and organizational cultures influence policy decisions.
        - bureaucratic politics can lead to suboptimal outcomes due to inter-departmental rivalries.
    
    ### **Chapter 3: Bureaucracies and Foreign Policy**
    
    - explores the significant role that bureaucratic institutions play in the formulation and implementation of foreign policy
    
    *Key Points:*
    
    - **Bureaucratic Politics Model:**
        - Proposes that foreign policy results from bargaining among various government agencies, each with its own interests.
        - Decisions emerge from compromises and power struggles rather than a unified national interest.
    - **Organizational Processes Model:**
        - Focuses on how established procedures and routines within organizations shape policy outcomes.
        - Highlights the potential for inertia and resistance to change within bureaucracies.
    - **Case Studies:**
        - Illustrates concepts with historical examples, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis, demonstrating how bureaucratic dynamics influenced critical decisions.
    
    ### **Chapter 7: Foreign Policy and Change**
    
    *Overview:*
    
    - addresses the factors that drive changes in foreign policy, considering both internal and external influences.
    
    *Key Points:*
    
    - **Sources of Change:**
        - **Domestic Factors:**
            - Political leadership transitions can lead to shifts in foreign policy priorities.
            - Public opinion and interest groups may pressure governments to alter policies.
        - **International Factors:**
            - Changes in the global power structure, such as the rise of new superpowers, can necessitate policy adjustments.
            - International crises or conflicts may force states to reevaluate their foreign policy strategies.
    - **Mechanisms of Change:**
        - **Learning:**
            - States and leaders learn from past experiences, leading to policy adaptations.
        - **Normative Shifts:**
            - Evolving international norms and values can influence state behavior and policy directions.
    - **Challenges to Change:**
        - Institutional inertia and entrenched interests within bureaucracies can impede policy shifts.
        - Risk aversion among leaders may lead to a preference for maintaining the status quo.
    
    *Conclusion:*
    
    - Understanding foreign policy requires a multifaceted approach that considers rational calculations, psychological influences, organizational dynamics, and the capacity for change.
    - A comprehensive analysis must account for the complex interplay between individual decision-makers, bureaucratic institutions, and the broader international environment.
    
- Allison, G. T., & Halperin, M. H. (1972). Bureaucratic politics: A paradigm and some policy implications. *World politics*, *24*(S1), 40-79.
    
    **Overview:**
    
    - Allison and Halperin challenge the traditional notion of the state as a monolithic, rational actor in foreign policy decision-making.
    - introduce the Bureaucratic Politics Model
    - foreign policy outcomes result from complex interactions among various governmental actors, each with distinct interests and objectives.
    
    **Key Concepts:**
    
    1. **Policy as Political Outcome:**
        - Foreign policy decisions emerge from negotiations, compromises, and power struggles among multiple actors within the government.
        - These actors include individuals and organizations, each pursuing their own goals, leading to decisions that are often political resultants rather than strategic choices.
    2. **Players in the Game:**
        - **Chiefs:** High-ranking officials such as the President, cabinet members, and agency heads.
        - **Indians:** Subordinate officials and staff members who provide support and carry out directives.
        - **Ad Hoc Players:** Individuals or groups brought in for specific issues or crises.
    3. **Parochial Priorities and Perceptions:**
        - Each actor's stance is influenced by their organisational role, personal experiences, and institutional interests.
        - This leads to varying perceptions of issues and preferred solutions, often resulting in conflicts and bargaining.
    4. **Action Channels:**
        - Established pathways determine which players are involved in decision-making processes and how information flows.
        - These channels shape the dynamics of the bargaining process and influence outcomes.
    5. **Decision Rules:**
        - Formal and informal procedures guide how decisions are made within the government.
        - These rules can empower or constrain certain actors, affecting their ability to influence policy.
    
    **Mechanisms of Bureaucratic Politics:**
    
    - **Bargaining:** Actors negotiate to align policies with their interests, often leading to compromises.
    - **Coalition Building:** Forming alliances to strengthen one's position and influence outcomes.
    - **Logrolling:** Exchanging support on different issues to achieve desired objectives.
    - **Foot-Dragging:** Delaying or obstructing policies that are unfavourable to an actor's interests.
    
    **Implications for Foreign Policy Analysis:**
    
    - Recognising that foreign policy is not the product of a singular rational actor but the outcome of multiple competing interests.
    - Understanding the importance of internal governmental dynamics in shaping policy decisions.
    - Highlighting the need to consider the roles of individual actors, organisational interests, and procedural mechanisms in analyses.
    
    **Critiques and Limitations:**
    
    - The model may overemphasize internal politics, potentially underestimating external factors and systemic constraints.
    - It can be challenging to apply empirically due to the complexity and opacity of internal governmental processes.
    - Some argue that it diminishes the role of strategic considerations and the influence of the executive leadership.
    
    **Conclusion:**
    
    - Allison and Halperin's Bureaucratic Politics Model provides a nuanced framework for understanding foreign policy as the result of intricate governmental interactions.
    - It underscores the significance of internal dynamics, individual actors, and organizational interests in shaping policy outcomes.
    - While it offers valuable insights, analysts should balance this perspective with considerations of external factors and overarching strategic objectives.
- Krasner, S. D. (1972). Are bureaucracies important?(or Allison Wonderland). *Foreign Policy*, (7), 159-179.
    - Krasner critically examines the Bureaucratic Politics Model, particularly as articulated by Graham Allison, questioning its explanatory power in foreign policy analysis.
    
    **Key Arguments:**
    
    1. **Critique of the Bureaucratic Politics Model:**
        - Krasner argues that the model overemphasizes internal governmental conflicts and underestimates the influence of central decision-makers, especially the President.
        - He contends that attributing policy outcomes primarily to bureaucratic infighting can obscure the strategic objectives and directives set by top leadership.
    2. **Presidential Authority:**
        - The article emphasizes the significant role of the President in shaping foreign policy, suggesting that ultimate decisions often reflect presidential priorities rather than bureaucratic compromises.
        - Krasner posits that the President possesses the authority to override bureaucratic resistance, thereby centralizing decision-making power.
    3. **Case Study Analysis:**
        - Krasner re-examines the Cuban Missile Crisis, a key example used by Allison, to illustrate his points.
        - He argues that the resolution of the crisis was more a result of presidential leadership and less about bureaucratic maneuvering.
    4. **Analytical Concerns:**
        - The article raises concerns about the methodological challenges in applying the Bureaucratic Politics Model, such as difficulties in empirically validating the extent of bureaucratic influence.
        - Krasner warns that overreliance on this model may lead to analytical distortions, diverting attention from the strategic calculations of top leaders.
    
    **Implications for Foreign Policy Analysis:**
    
    - Krasner's critique suggests a need to balance considerations of bureaucratic dynamics with an understanding of the central role of executive leadership in foreign policy formulation.
    - He advocates for a more nuanced approach that recognizes the interplay between organizational processes and the directives of top policymakers.
    
    **Conclusion:**
    
    - While acknowledging that bureaucratic factors can influence policy implementation, Krasner emphasizes that the primary determinants of foreign policy decisions often reside at the highest levels of government authority.
    - His analysis calls for a reassessment of models that may underplay the decisive role of central leadership in international relations. Comparison of Allison & Halperin (1972) and Krasner (1972) | **Aspect** | **Allison & Halperin (1972)** | **Krasner (1972)** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core Argument** | Challenges the notion of a unitary, rational state actor; proposes that foreign policy results from bargaining among multiple government actors. | Critiques the Bureaucratic Politics Model for overstating bureaucratic influence and underestimating the role of the President in decision-making. |
| **Key Model** | **Bureaucratic Politics Model** – decisions emerge from negotiations, compromises, and institutional interests rather than a single rational actor. | **Presidential Leadership Model (Implicit)** – decision-making is more centralized, with the President playing the dominant role. |
| **Decision-Making Perspective** | Policy is shaped by bureaucratic competition, organizational interests, and individual roles. | Policy is primarily determined by strategic objectives set by top leadership, particularly the President. |
| **View on Bureaucracy** | Bureaucratic actors have significant influence, and policy outcomes result from their power struggles. | Bureaucratic influence is overstated; top leadership can override bureaucratic resistance. |
| **Role of the President** | One of many actors in the policy-making process; constrained by bureaucratic politics. | The central decision-maker who ultimately shapes foreign policy. |
| **Methodological Concerns** | Acknowledges the difficulty of empirically analysing internal bureaucratic struggles but argues they are crucial for understanding policy outcomes. | Criticises the Bureaucratic Politics Model for being difficult to empirically verify and for potentially leading to analytical distortions. |
| **Case Study Reference** | Uses the Cuban Missile Crisis as an example of bureaucratic negotiations influencing policy. | Re-examines the Cuban Missile Crisis, arguing that presidential leadership was the primary factor in resolving the crisis. |
| **Implications for Foreign Policy Analysis** | Suggests analysts focus on intra-governmental dynamics and bargaining to understand policy decisions. | Argues for a re-emphasis on strategic decision-making by top leadership rather than bureaucratic infighting. |
| **Critiques & Limitations** | Overemphasizes internal politics, potentially neglecting external pressures and strategic considerations. | Overlooks the possibility that bureaucratic struggles can significantly shape the options available to decision-makers. | and cite in the essay like this: (author, year)"

"please rewrite this essay by incorporating this advice in it from my uni professor: advice: This was a good essay which showed some good knowledge and understanding, but a lot of improvement is still needed. 

Arguments could be more fully and deeper laid out. Game Theory could for instance have been included before getting into the example of MAD. Equally a higher level discussion of ‘operational environment’ or ‘black box’ would have better set up section two. 

Also try and pick illustrations that can run consistently throughout. As it is they are many different ones that are scattered, and thus comparison is negated. Picking one, like nuclear weapons, then showing how it makes sense in rational choice, ontological security, and then brining this together to illustrate pollyheuristic would be very strong. 

Overall a 60 is given as you show some good understanding, but it is on a knife edge. Please incorporate some of the above advice into next paper.

Write us also all other travel-relevant information: What about your language skills? Do you have special previous knowledge of your subject? We give you a structure to start with, however, you can modify it and delete the introductions. But please make sure that you cover all topics.

Motivation
National borders have always seemed bizarre to me. I grew up in a Norwegian town only 20 kilometres from the Swedish border, where an intangible line supposedly divides two countries, two peoples, two languages, and two cultures. In reality, however, this was not what I experienced. As I grew up, I realized the grammatical structures of my dialect reflect the Swedish language to a higher degree than the standardized Norwegian one, we have the same cultural food and the same burning passion for skiing. This sparked a strong sense of curiosity in me, a spark to search the world, not for causes that divide us but instead for reasons that bring us together and behind which we can ensemble in a world which seems to become ever more divided and authoritarian.
This curiosity eventually introduced me to the movement known as the United World Colleges, for which I applied and was selected as one of two Norwegians to attend the United World College of the Adriatic in Trieste, Italy. At this school, I lived, studied and conversed with youths from over 80 different nationalities. Consequently, international conflicts did not simply solely exist on the news, but became a part of our daily lives. Everything from the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the lasting tension between China and Japan became engraved in the conscience of every student. However, instead of letting these conflicts create tension between students, we were encouraged to listen to each other and discuss. In this way, tragedies became more than numbers on TV; they became catastrophes that ended the lives of living, human beings. Together, we learnt to empathize, listen and work constructively towards long-lasting solutions. Sooner, rather than later, students from opposing countries started to care about and for each other and understood that the real cause of many of the world’s conflicts is authoritarian regimes prioritizing themselves and power rather than the lives of human beings. It is through these experiences that I truly discovered the importance of democracy as a catalyst for peace, development, understanding and collaboration through goals, values and ambitions shared by countless people across the globe, echoing the discovery from my childhood that people are not necessarily so different despite being from diverse backgrounds.
These experiences and this curiosity have led me to where I am today. This September, I am moving to Berlin where I will study for a Bachelor of Politics and International Relations. This will allow me to better understand, comprehend and contextualise everything I have learnt. I am studying for this degree to understand how conflicts arise, and how we can work systematically towards a freer and more peaceful world, and I can not imagine a better place to study this than Berlin. Berlin has for centuries been at the heart of European and international politics and has seen the rise and fall of authoritarian regimes responsible for unimaginable and unforgettable genocides, war crimes, hate and violence. Even so, Berlin today is the capital of a free, democratic Germany which has positioned itself as a bastion of human rights and peace. In this way, Berlin and Germany as a whole is a clear example of the scars that hate can leave on a society, but also about have humanity can slowly heal and create a future based on mutual respect and human dignity. This is why I wish to conduct this study trip visiting Berlin and surrounding regions: in order to learn more about the contentious and relevant history of hate, violence and reconciliation in both historical and contemporary contexts. I wish to conduct this trip to learn the inner workings and consequences of hatred derived from harmful ideologies and how it affected and continues to affect countless lives in Germany and abroad. This will help me better understand the importance of the city that I am going to study in and grant me invaluable knowledge and insight relating to my field of study, helping me better understand how to stop the illness of hate at its root, and allowing me to familiarise myself with this information before I inevitably will be busy with readings and assignments. I am certain that this experience will foundationalise in me exactly why I wish to study Politics and why it is so immensely important. This is because we are unfortunately experiencing a resurgence of hatred and violence in Germany, in Europe and worldwide, and my life mission is to counteract this trend and contribute to creating a more just and peaceful world.

Topic
Give a detailed description of the topic: What is your personal interest in the topic? Which questions do you want to investigate in the country of travel? What is the connection between your topic and the country you are visiting?
The topic to which I wish to dedicate this study trip is an exploration of how hate, rooted in harmful ideologies, can divide society and lead to violence. Even so, I want to put an equal amount of importance on investigating into how once divided societies can reconcile and rebuild in an effort to focus on fostering peace, human dignity and mutual respect. This will be done through the lense of understanding the historical and contemporary impacts of hate and reconciliation in Germany, analysing to which extent it has been successful and if it can be a model that can be used in other parts of the world. Therefore, this topic delve into the themes of the divisive and deceiptful nature of hate and authoritarian regimes, how they gain power and maintain it. It will also analyse the historical scars left by hate-driven ideologies, particularly in Germany, but also assessing the process of societal healing as a model for peace-building and creating a society with high interpersonal trust.

Personal Interest:
Apart from my preexisting interests in the topics of hate and reconciliation, I also have a personal interest in conducting such a study trip exactly in this part of Germany. My grandma grew up during the Cold War and saw first-hand how competing ideologies cut the continent of Europe in half. During her youth, my grandma lived for a while with a German family which lived just kilometres from where the fortified border between East and West Germany was, near Haarbrück(en?). Seeing up close how communities, towns and people were isolated from each other deeply affected my grandma. My whole childhood I heard the stories that she told from her time in Germany, and I believe that these stories were what first made me question the notion of countries and borders, and has therefore led me to where I am today. Hence, I want to spend a portion of my study trip in Haarbrück(en?) where my grandma once stayed, walking in her footsteps and learning about the stories she also learnt.
Central questions:
This topic prompts me to create a series of central questions which will be essential. This could be researching how Germany started the process of reconciliation after the atrocities after the Nazi regime and after the German Reunification. To do so, it will be important to research what policies and societal efforts that contributed to Germany’s transformation into a strong and stable democracy which constitutionally protect human rights. Once this is done, it is also relevant to assess how Germany is addressing the resurgence of dangerous ideologies and political movements that once again are on the rise. I would like to explore what lessons can be learned from Germany’s successes and faults and how it can be applied to contemporary global challenges relating to hate, violence, peace and development. I would especially like to focus on how cultural and historical memory (Erinnerungskultur) can act as an important catalyst for the prevention of recurrence of hate-driven violence and make progress, coexistance and justice possible.

Connection between topic and the country:
There are a plethora of connections that can be made between my topic and the country I want to conduct the study trip in, Germany. Firstly, there is the historical context and connection. Germany is one of the prime examples of countries with a history of violence derived from hate and harmful ideologies, and therefore acts as an important case study for the destructive power such movements can have. Furthermore, the Cold War, including the division of Germany and Berlin highlight the immense cost that ideological divides can have, and how it impacts societies. It also symbolizes the struggle for reconciliation and reunification under a system in which justice triumphs. In this way, Berlin and Germany acts as a symbol of division and reconciliation, as it embodies both the scars of history and the hope for a united and peaceful future. Another connection could be the contemporary relevance of Berlin and Germany, faced with the rise of extremism challenging the status quo. Another connection can be found between the topic and my personal and academic journey. As I am an incoming student in Berlin, understanding more about Berlin and Germany will help deepen my academic foundation. At the same time learning from Germany’s lessons will enhance my ability to address hate at a local and international level.

During this study trip I plan to mainly use English as my language of communication, as I am highly fluent in it after conducting my high school education in it. When convenient and if necessary, I can also use my limited knowledge of German as I have studied it previously, which has resulted in me currently having an A2 level. I also believe that this study trip would be a great opportunity to practise and improve my German. Other than this, I am also able to communicate in Norwegian, my mother tongue, Italian and Swedish. I have listed underneath the languages I know and to what level.

Experience:
I have previously traveled across several countries alone and I am therefore confident and comfortable with conducting this study trip alone. Some of the countries I have travelled in alone include Sweden, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Slovenia, Spain and Serbia. In this way, I am equipped with the necessary skills to embark on such a trip and I am confident that I will be able to solve any problem that may arise. As I have also previously been to different parts of Germany, I am also familiar with the cultural and linguistic aspects of the country, which have prepared me for orienting myself in the country while there on my own."

"I need a case study of the US which reflects the poliheuristic theory of foreign policy decision-making: Poliheuristic theory is a two-stage decision-making model that merges cognitive and rational approaches to explain how leaders make foreign policy decisions (Mintz, 2004). In the first stage leaders eliminate all alternatives that are politically unacceptable or do not meet outlined criteria, based on personal or regime concerns. According to this noncompensatory rule, they discard all options that carry political costs, regardless of potential gains in other areas like economic or strategic interests. Domestic political audience costs are an integral part of foreign policy decision making. Moreover, Political leaders’ self-interest in political survival is paramount (Russett and Barzilai 1992).

In stage two, after eliminating all politically unacceptable options, leaders switch to rational decision-making. They analyse the remaining alternatives weighing risks and benefits using cost-benefit analysis or expected utility models. Their focus is on maximising outcomes and selecting the best option based on more traditional criteria such as strategic benefits or minimizing risks. Poliheuristic theory has been applied to decisions in various aspects of foreign policy decision-making, such as the use of force (Mintz, 1993), war termination (Mintz, Geva, 1998) or coalition formation. Leaders might use poliheuristic theory to first eliminate military options that would cause unacceptable domestic repercussions and then evaluate the remaining alternatives based on strategic or international concerns. Similarly, during coalition formation political parties eliminate partners based on political feasibility (whether the alliance would hurt domestic approval) and then consider coalitions from the remaining options that offer strategic advantages (Mintz, 1995). 
Poliheuristic theory is also useful in explaining other international Relations theories, such as Democratic Peace Theory (Doyle, 1983). Leaders of democracies refrain from attacking another democracy because it is politically too costly. However, no such constraint exists when the opponent is nondemocratic (Mintz, Geva, 1993)."

I. INTRODUCTION

In February 2011, in the midst of Japan's widely-criticized research
whale hunt, the Japanese Agriculture Minister Michihiko Kano called the
whaling fleet home months ahead of plan and hundreds short of its kill quota.
The reason given for the abrupt end to the whaling season was harassment by a
nongovernmental organization (NGO) called the Sea Shepherd Conservation
2 Society (Sea Shepherds). For years, the Japanese fleet had taken pride in its
ability to outrun environmental activists, 3 and Japan had refused to put an end
to its research whaling operations in the face of resolutions from the
International Whaling Commission (IWC)4 and repeated cessation requests.
Ultimately, it was confrontation instigated by a renegade group, rather than any
international resolution or NGO pressure, that brought an abrupt end to Japan's
controversial whaling practices.
In recent years, the NGO community has played an increasingly
important and well-recognized role in shaping international law and in focusing
enforcement resources. As a result, NGOs have earned invitations as official
delegates to several major international conventions, particularly those

addressing the environment.5 Moreover, news of the abrupt end of the Japanese
whaling season demonstrates that environmental NGOs now have the ability to
compel compliance with international commitments through unilateral action.
According to the Sea Shepherds as well as popular literature, this forced
compliance is nothing more than private ""enforcement"" of international law.6
However, this assessment is too simplistic; a more nuanced theory of the
principal functions of international lawmaking, known as the ""New Haven
School,""7 identifies seven distinct categories of actions: ""intelligence,
promotion or recommendation, prescription, invocation, application,
termination, [and] appraisal.""8 Examining NGO activism through this

paradigm is particularly useful for a number of reasons. First, the theory's well-
defined, function-based stages better describe the effects of activism than

simple, conventional designations that rely on the identity of the actors or the
forum. Indeed, NGO activism can be understood as carrying out four of the
seven aforementioned functions: promotion, prescription, invocation, or
application.9 In addition to this descriptive advantage, the legal realist
philosophical underpinnings of the New Haven School make it a natural fit for
describing the unorthodox, but increasingly legitimate, role of NGOs in the
international legal system. Finally, the longevity and prominence of the New
Haven School provide a credible, well-understood framework to facilitate
continued scholarly debate.

Two Models of Activism

Oceanlo as a case study to analyze two competing models of NGO activism.
The Comment defines the two competing models as ""protest"" and
""interventionist"" activism."" This Comment will show that the lawmaking
function of activism and the effect it has on international behavioral norms
change depending on the model employed. It concludes that, despite serious
drawbacks, there are certain circumstances under which NGOs should adopt
more interventionist activism to enforce international environmental law.
In the Southern Ocean, two types of environmental campaigns have
targeted the whaling industry. One approach, employed by Greenpeace,12
utilizes consumer boycotts and protests to encourage divestment from the
industry. The other approach, taken by the Sea Shepherds, uses a fleet of ships
to directly intervene in and obstruct whaling operations in the Southern
Ocean.'3
Greenpeace's approach exemplifies protest activism, which consists of
publicly organized, undoubtedly legal activities meant to put indirect pressure
on the governmental or private entities that are purportedly violating
international law. This is a law-promoting or perhaps law-prescribing function;
it aspires to shift public policy and community expectations. The Sea
Shepherds' approach, in contrast, exemplifies interventionist activism, a model
that involves either borderline- or blatantly illegal tactics to confront violators
directly. Interventionist action generally includes law invocation and direct
application of force to implement existing laws and policies. Contrasting the
effectiveness and legality of these distinct approaches to anti-whaling activism
will inform the international community's important and inevitable
determination of the role of NGOs in international law enforcement.
10. The Southern Ocean is the fourth largest of the five principal oceanic divisions. Although
there are competing definitions as to its precise boundaries, the Southern Ocean is generally thought to
comprise the area of the ocean that sits south of roughly 600 S latitude and encircles Antarctica. Oceans:

11. These two terms are borrowed from Paul Watson. See, e.g., Michael Shapiro, Sea
Shepherd's Paul Watson: 'You Don't Watch Whales Die and Hold Signs and Do Nothing', GUARDIAN,
Sept. 21, 2010, http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/sep/21/sea-shepherd-paul-watson-whales
(quoting Paul Watson, ""We're an interventionist organization, not a protest organization. Protest is very
submissive - it's like saying, 'please please, please, don't kill the whales.' Then they go and kill them
anyway - nobody cares. The fact is, you gotta stop them - you're dealing with ruthless people, and you
have to stop them.""). This Comment defines the ""protest"" model of activism as essentially a form of
grassroots lobbying, utilizing public education and consumer pressure to influence corporate and
government policy decisions. It has become the preferred method of larger, international NGOs (e.g., Oxfam, Amnesty International) that want to preserve their legitimacy and increase the number of people
and dollars dedicated to their organization. These organizations do not want to be perceived as too
radical for fear that they will no longer be taken seriously and will therefore have diminished impact. As
the name implies, this Comment defines ""interventionist"" activism as more direct confrontation with the
actors who are carrying out an opposed policy on the ground. For this reason, it is a much more risky
and costly endeavor in terms of resources and reputation. NGOs that adopt the ""interventionist"" model
of activism tend to be smaller and narrowly focused on specific issues (e.g., Sea Shepherds, Radical
Action for Mountain People's Survival or RAMPS).

activism; this Comment focuses solely on Greenpeace's protest campaign for the purposes of
comparison.

This Comment is divided into four parts. Part I will describe the problem
presented by international whaling and provide a historical context of the
industry, its relatively recent regulation, and specific actions concerning
Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean. Parts II and III will draw on this case
study to illustrate the competing models of activism-protest and
interventionist-and highlight the demonstrated advantages of and drawbacks
to each. Part IV will lend insight into the implications of permitting each
model.
II. HISTORY OF WHALING REGULATION AND INEFFECTIVE FORMAL

ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS

The Japanese have been eating whale meat and using whale products for
more than two thousand years. 14 Whales were generally regarded as a natural
resource that could be exploited freely by any person with the ability to hunt
and kill them; they were a part of the common heritage of mankind that was the
sea.15 In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, demand for whale meat,
baleen, bones, blubber, and oil grew. Consequently, the commercial whaling
industry blossomed in the fishing hubs of Scandinavia, Russia, Japan, and
certain areas of the United States.' 6
Whaling continued into the twentieth century, and despite a worldwide
decline in the industry, the advent of efficient tracking and hunting

technologies brought several whale species to the brink of extinction by mid-
century.17 This prompted the whale hunters to realize their industry's survival

depended on maintaining healthy whale stocks through managed conservation
rather than unrestrained exploitation.' 8 In response, the whaling nations
gathered and analyzed relevant data to support the case for new regulatory
policy and to educate the public. These early efforts to diagnose the danger of
extinction served the New Haven School's intelligence function.19 Similarly,
the advocacy on the part of the whale hunters and their national governments
marked the beginning of the law promotion stage.20 These efforts resulted in
the formation of the first authoritative international commitments on whaling.
In the face of strong scientific evidence and even stronger appeals to the
public conscience, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling

Two Models of Activism

(ICRW) served the prescription function by explicitly laying out the points of
international consensus on the regulation of whaling.2 1 The ICRW was drafted
in 1946 with fifteen state parties and has subsequently been amended. It now
has eighty-nine state parties and remains the chief international legal document
governing the whaling practices of participating nations. For the purposes of
this case study regarding Japanese whaling in the Southern Ocean, Article VIII
and the Schedule of the ICRW provide the relevant legal prescriptions. As of
1986, the ICRW has included in the Schedule a ban on commercial whaling of
any type,22 setting and maintaining annual catch limits of zero in all regions for
all types of whales.23 Despite initially objecting to the moratorium, Japan has
since withdrawn its objection and has maintained that it is in compliance with
the ICRW. In addition to the general obligations of the moratorium, the IWC
established in 1994 a whale sanctuary in the Southern Ocean, specifically
forbidding commercial whaling in that area.24 Japan objected to the sanctuary's 25 creation with respect only to Antarctic minke whale stocks.
Japan has conducted whaling operations in the Southern Ocean after 1986
under the auspices of the ""scientific research"" or ""special permit"" exception
26 embodied in Article VIII of the ICRW. Article VIII provides in part that ""any
Contracting Government may grant to any of its nationals a special permit
authorizing that national to kill, take and treat whales for purposes of scientific
research . . . and the killing, taking, and treating of whales in accordance with
the provisions of this Article shall be exempt from the operation of this
Convention.""27 Article VIII further allows the whales taken under this
exception to be processed and sold on the commercial market pursuant to the
instructions of the country granting the research permit.28
Although Japan has steadfastly asserted the legality of its whaling
operations under the special permit system, many other IWC nations regard its

best scientific advice, and by 1990 at the latest the Commission will undertake a comprehensive

operations as violating the ICRW.29 Even if Japan's whaling activity falls under
the Article VIII exception, based on the government's statements, the
customary international law principle of pacta sunt servanda, codified in the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, requires that Japan perform its
treaty obligations in ""good faith.""30
Japan's programs (JARPA I and 11)31 do not plausibly serve ""purposes of
scientific research"" within the meaning of Article VIII of ICRW. Although the
JARPA program has been in effect since the initial imposition of the
moratorium, Japan has produced very few, if any, peer-reviewed studies
explaining the program's scientific findings. 32 The IWC Scientific Committee,
commenting on Japan's studies in the North Pacific in 2000 (then called
JARPN, rather than JARPA), has said that the Japanese research ""did not
address questions of high priority relevant to management, did not make full
use of existing data, and revealed many methodological problems.""33 Japan,
along with some international commentators, maintains that it need not provide
any scientific studies at all showing the results of its research in order to justify
classification as a ""research"" program. 34 A majority of the IWC nations have
made clear through repeated resolutions3 5 that the permits granted by Japan in
the JARPA I and II programs were beyond the scope of the Article VIII
scientific research exception, or, at least, constituted a bad faith use of the
exception. 3 6 The aforementioned ""good faith"" obligation requires that even if

of 300 minke whales per season until 1995, after which capture was set at 400 whales per season.

Two Models of Activism

Japan's self-proclaimed ""research"" classification controls textually, the Article
VIII exception still cannot be abused in this way.
Formal international law enforcement mechanisms, such as resolutions,
have been ineffectual in ending Japan's illegal whaling in the Southern Ocean.
Lacking the necessary invocation and application functions of international
lawmaking, the ICRW and domestic law prescriptions have had no lasting
effect on community behavior.37 Japan has been authorizing whaling through
the JARPA programs continuously since 1986. It has taken over twenty years
of Japanese disregard for IWC recommendations for the Australian
government-joined by twenty-nine other nations and the European
Commission-to file in 2010 an Application Instituting Proceedings in the
International Court of Justice (ICJ). 39 Nonetheless, even if the ICJ rules in favor
of Australia, which is by no means certain,40 that still may not affect the
Japanese whale hunt.41 This effort is too little, too late; it pales in comparison to
the effect that both protest and interventionist forms of activism have had on
the Japanese whaling industry."

马克思主义–女性主义
Marxism-Feminism [Marxismus-Feminismus]
is characterised by its effort to fight and work
for an integration of the feminist revolution
into Marxism. The resistance it encounters
means that feminism has been forced to take
on an initially oppositional and polemical
form. The aim of the feminist revolution is the
liberation of women from male domination
as a precondition for the transformation
of our society into one based on solidarity.
This perspective seeks the eradication of
patriarchal gender relations as an integral
aspect of the socialist transformation of
the relations of production. This means
revolutionising the revolution, setting out
to alter every dimension, every aspect of the
social.
For theoretical consistency, this requires

Marxism-Feminism to think of gender rela-
tions as relations of production. This position

is founded on Marx and Engels’s thesis that

male domination over the female gender con-
stitutes the first instance of historical class

relations, at the heart of which is the ability
to dispose of others’ labour-power (German
Ideology, 3/32); slavery can be seen as an
extension of this form (Marx 1972, 160).
One of the problems for Marxist

Feminism is the question of its theoreti-
cal and practical approach to the ‘inter-
section’ of gender relations with relations

of class and race. Another central prob-
lem is the challenge of conceptualising

the persistence of sexual violence against
women without constructing naturalised
and essentialised dichotomies of masculinity
versus femininity.
Feminist Marxism has deliberately taken
up the ‘one-sided’ feminist challenge and
started to transform theory and praxis.

Historically and conceptually this transfor-
mation also coincides with the strategic inte-
gration of ecology.

Insofar as the goals of feminist Marxism
and Marxist Feminism draw closer together,
and thereby enhance Marxism itself, so their
contrasting differences begin to disappear.

From both a programmatic and a practical-
utopian perspective, they can therefore be

seen as historical and transitory formations.
However, even if they are bound to disappear
as distinct formations in the wake of their
successes, the work that they have started will
continue for generations.
1 Origins
The expression ‘Marxism-Feminism’ first
appeared as a term designed for international
struggle at the beginning of the 1970s. Its exact
meaning was gradually developed through a

learning-process that took place in a conflic-
tual field of multiple meanings, promoted by

a minority among the feminist voices that
was also marginalised among the Marxists.
It originated in the context of a students’
movement that had started to read Marx,
and a women’s movement that attempted
to change traditional Marxism by inserting
within it the standpoint of women and a
programme for their liberation. The overlap

between elements of both movements cre-
ated an environment in which such struggles

for change could be waged. This resulted not

Historical Materialism 24.4 (2016) 257–270

only in conflict between feminists, but above
all in conflict between feminists and those
who advocated an orthodox Marxism that
was both factional and dogmatic. In Germany,
this was, in part, thanks to groups of students
(‘K-Gruppen’) who attempted to protect the
‘one true’ Marxism from feminist infiltration.
Mariarosa Dalla Costa and others called
a conference in Italy (Padua) to discuss the
‘overthrow of society’. Participants included
about 20 feminists from the US, Italy, France
and the UK, who united around a campaign
for ‘Wages for Housework’. This was extremely
successfully launched under the leadership of
Dalla Costa and Selma James with a call for a
strike on housework (Sylvia Federici renewed
this call in 2012). In 1972 Dalla Costa and

James published their manifesto for the ‘over-
throw of society’ simultaneously in Italian

and English; the following year it was trans-
lated and published in German, and later

in Spanish and French. It entails a feminist

reading of Marx that launched the ‘domestic-
labour debate’. Here, the unwaged labour of

women in the household is considered as pro-
ducing surplus-value, since women also work

longer hours than are needed for their indi-
vidual reproduction. Female unwaged labour

is discussed in relation to the reproduction
of capital, and the refusal of housework is
proposed as a subversive and revolutionary
strategy.

These arguments caused sharp pub-
lic debate, published mainly in the New

Left Review between 1974 and 1977. Wally
Seccombe’s contribution, ‘The Housewife
and her Labour under Capitalism’ (1974),
opened the debate to underline the role of

work in the household for a critique of politi-
cal economy. While the position of Dalla

Costa, developed within the framework of

autonomist Marxism (Operaismo), found sup-
porters worldwide, it also provoked strong

feminist critiques of its conceptualisation of
housewives as waged labourers who would

be enabled, through wage-payment, to col-
lectively organise childcare, meal preparation

and so forth. Heidi Hartmann summarises
the consciousness-raising potential of the

Wages for Housework position in this way:
‘By demanding wages for housework and

by refusing to participate in the labour mar-
ket women can lead the struggle against

capital. Women’s community organisations
can be subversive to capital and lay the basis

not only for resistance to the encroach-
ment of capital but also for the forma-
tion of a new society’ (1979, 6). However,

Hartmann makes the criticism that, while

this strategy makes women part of the anti-
capitalist struggle, it does not evince feminist

thinking in terms of the actual content of the
gendered division of work, thus it remains
fundamentally economistic and does not aim
for a more human society.

In 1979, Sheila Rowbotham et alii’s influ-
ential book on the relationship between the

women’s movement and socialist organisa-
tion was published in the UK. It problema-
tised conceptualisations of consciousness

and the avant-garde. It argued that the
women’s movement had ‘cut through circular

avant-gardist thinking’; questioned the crite-
ria by which avant-gardism defined ‘progres-
siveness’ and ‘backwardness’; and pointed

instead to a praxis based on ‘lived experience’
(1979, 102–11). Opposition to feminism in
groups that regarded themselves as Trotskyist
and Leninist often resulted in women quitting
those socialist and communist organisations.
Carla Ravaioli notes in the case of Italy that the
failure of feminist women to change socialist

politics then led to a strategy of ‘double mili-
tancy’, in that they had to fight on two fronts:

one directly against capital, the other against
patriarchal cultures and their consequences,
which in turn have been employed and
cynically exploited by capital (1977, 163 et sq.).

A fierce debate resulted from the publica-
tion of Heidi Hartmann’s essay ‘The Unhappy

Marriage of Marxism and Feminism’, first
published in the US in 1975, re-worked in

cooperation with Amy B. Bridges and repub-
lished in 1977, re-printed in Capital & Class in

1979, and finally appearing in 1981 together

with twelve contributions to the debate pub-
lished in the volume Women and Revolution,

edited by Lydia Sargent. In the Introduction

Historical-Critical Dictionary of Marxism 259

Historical Materialism 24.4 (2016) 257–270

to the volume Sargent formulated a theoreti-
cal challenge: ‘How can women understand

their particular oppression in a way that can

confront the narrowness of Marxist terminol-
ogy (as used by the men in the movement)

which focuses on work and economic rela-
tions as the primary (sometimes only) area of

importance; and how can they develop a new
theory which understands the importance of
reproduction, family, and sexuality as central
to current analyses and future visions?’ (1981,
xviii).

In its composition Sargent’s edited vol-
ume is a classic of productive engagement

in debate. It showcases work in progress: dif-
ferent positions are introduced as first steps,

prerequisites are formulated, and perspec-
tives on what still has to be developed are

sketched out. The following terms are shown
to be contested: production, patriarchy, sex/
gender system, the personal and the private
as political – within a Marxism in motion

of which Marxism-Feminism is one expres-
sion, alongside the ‘everyday-life school’

(for example, Eli Zaretsky, 1973) and the
‘Radical Feminists’ (for example, Shulamith
Firestone 1971, and Kate Millett 1969). Right

from the beginning these individual posi-
tions establish themselves on a dividing-
line, where the centre of analysis switches

between either the position of women in the

economic system or the relations of domina-
tion between men and women.

Hartmann argues initially that the spe-
cific focus of feminist Marxism is a depar-
ture from ‘the women question’. ‘The women

question has never been the “feminist ques-
tion” ’ (1975/1981, 3). The latter is much more

concerned with the development of a theory
of female oppression, of its integration into

capitalism, and with a basis for reconstruct-
ing Marxism. ‘Radical Feminists’ include psy-
choanalysis in their analysis. ‘The personal

is political’ means here that the ‘original and
basic class division is between the sexes, and

that the motive force in history is the striv-
ing of men for power and domination over

women, the dialectic of sex’ (1979, 10).

Zaretsky aims to widen our understand-
ing of production and work by integrating

housework, and thereby to update Marxism

by integrating feminist questions. ‘The house-
wife emerged, alongside the proletariat [as]

the two characteristic laborers of developed
capitalist society’ (1973, 114). The feminist

Marxism suggested by Hartmann formu-
lates its challenge as the attempt ‘to use [. . .]

Marxism to consider patriarchy as a system
of social relations based on men’s control of
women’s labor power, both in the home and
in the wider economy’ (1975/1981, 371). In this
way, it avoids economism, which suggests one
unitary system in which everyone labours
for capitalism, and also the psychologism of
theories of patriarchy, which develop another
unitary theory that assumes an essentialist
male drive for power.
There was no such systematic debate
in Germany, but Marxism-Feminism can

be traced in various accounts, bearing wit-
ness to the existence of such discussions.

The Frauenzentrum Berlin [Berlin Women’s
Centre] discussed a ‘Marxism/Feminism

working group’ that aimed to clarify the theo-
retical significance of feminism, as well as a

working group on ‘the workers’ and women’s
movement’ (see Jutta Menschik 1977, 96).
Herbert Marcuse was one of the supporters

of an interconnection of Marxism and femi-
nism. He gave a series of lectures on the topic

during 1974 in Germany and the US. Siegline
Tömmel argued that, as part of the ‘recent

opening-up of intensive debate on the rela-
tionship between Marxism and Feminism

and also on the theory of women’s liberation
[Frauenemanzipationstheorie] in Germany
[. . .] judgements about the priority of “class”

or “gender” in the struggle for women’s lib-
eration caused disagreement within the

women’s movement itself ’ (1975, 835). Initially
the female Marxists within the movement
gave predominantly defensive responses.

The seminar programme of the Otto-Suhr-
Institut at the Free University of Berlin lists

Schmidt-Harzbach, in which more than one
hundred students participated (Lenz 2010,
212).
In protest against the orthodox women’s
policy of their party, feminists in the French
Communist Party in Paris founded the journal
Elles voient rouge [Women See Red], and in

1980 they organised an international sympo-
sium entitled Féminisme et Marxisme. Here,

representatives of ‘autonomous’ women’s
groups as well as feminists within parties and

trade unions discussed politically and stra-
tegically how the women’s movement could

constitute itself as a force without having to
rely on traditional structures, debating, for
example, whether they should form their
own women’s party. Central topics included:
patriarchy and women as a class; housework
as productive or unproductive work; wages
for housework; the right to paid employment;
part-time work and the family; the women’s

movement and self-awareness groups; move-
ment and party; the state and the personal

as political; complicity; and homosexuality
(the discussion was published in 1981 under
the title of the symposium; see a review in
Das Argument, Beiheft 1983, 11 et sqq.). Nicole

Edith Thévenin (1982) announced program-
matically: ‘It seems to me that, from a Marxist

perspective, feminism is equally fruitful in
theory and in praxis’. From the beginning of
the 1980s, publications that highlighted the
tensions between Marxism and feminism
started to accumulate in Western-European
and Anglophone countries (USA, Canada,
Australia).
In the first place, Marxism-Feminism is a
concept of a movement [Bewegungsbegriff].
It polemicises, on the one hand, against
a form of Marxism that does not include
feminism, and, on the other hand, against a
feminism that does not view Marxism as its
guiding principle. ‘The women’s question

should be dealt with from a Marxist perspec-
tive, and to this end traditional Marxism

needs to be reconstructed, extended and
critically used’ (Haug/Hauser 1984, 17).
The history of the term Marxism-Feminism
– that is, when the term first appeared – can

only be vaguely delineated. A survey in 2014
asked 30 international Marxist Feminists
already active in the 1970s about who coined
the term Marxism-Feminism. Their responses
generated only hesitant references to one

another, but no clear results suitable for a his-
torical account (Haug 2014).

Internationally the term was used to
describe a current in contrast to ‘materialist
feminists’ or ‘socialist feminists’. Differences
were soon debated on internet discussion
forums. Retrospectively, Martha E. Gimenez
characterises these in this way: ‘In the
exciting times of the women’s liberation

movement, four main traditions of femi-
nist thought can be identified: the liberal

tradition (concerned with the realisation
of political equality within capitalism), the
radical tradition (concentrating on men and

patriarchy as the main sources of female sup-
pression), the socialist tradition (a critique

of capitalism and Marxism, aimed at avoid-
ing reductionism in Marxism that results in

a two-system theory, where an interaction
of capitalism and patriarchy is assumed)

and Marxist Feminists (a theoretical posi-
tion represented by relatively few feminists

in the US – including myself – that aimed to
develop the potential of Marxist theory, to

grasp the capitalist sources of female oppres-
sion’ (2000, 18). In the aftermath of the world

financial crisis of 2008 and beyond, the col-
lection and classification of texts from these

international currents has gained renewed

topicality in journals, workshops, and educa-
tional programmes of the Left, or, for exam-
ple, at the annual conference of the journal

Historical Materialism."

—Cherrie Moraga, “Half-Breed”

Race, Gender, and Exhaustion as a Condition of Existence
Every day, in every urban center of the world, thousands of black and brown women, invisible, are “opening” the city. They clean the spaces necessary for neo-patriarchy, and neoliberal and finance capitalism to function. They are doing dangerous work: they inhale toxic chemical products and push or carry heavy loads. They have usually travelled long hours in the early morning or late at night, and their work is underpaid and considered to be unskilled. They are usually in their forties or fifties. A second group, which shares with the first an intersection of class, race, and gender, go to middle class homes to cook, clean, and take care of children and the elderly, so that those who employ them can go to work in the places that the former group of women have cleaned. Meanwhile, in the same early hours of the morning, in the same big metropoles of the world, we can see women and men running through the streets, rushing to the nearest gym or yoga center. They follow the mandate to maintain healthy and clean bodies of late capitalism; they usually follow their run or workout with a shower, an avocado toast, and a detox drink before heading to their clean offices. Meanwhile, women of color try to find a seat for their exhausted bodies as they return on public transit from cleaning those gyms, banks, insurance offices, newspaper offices, investment companies, or restaurants and preparing meeting rooms for business breakfasts. They doze off as soon as they sit, their fatigue visible to those who care to see it. The working body that is made visible is the concern of an ever growing industry dedicated to the cleanliness and healthiness of body and mind, the better to serve racial capitalism. The other working body is made invisible even though it performs a necessary function for the first: to clean spaces in which the “clean” ones circulate, work, eat, sleep, have sex, and perform parenting. But the cleaners’ invisibility is required and naturalized. This has been happening for at least five hundred years, but I want to argue that looking at invisible/visible racialized cleaning/caring labor today, which is driven by the needs of finance capital and new forms of middle class living, brings together multiple intersecting issues that go beyond the division of chores within a couple or the calculation of what domestic labor adds to general growth. What I want to explore here is the dialectical relation between the white male performing body and the racialized female exhausted body; between the visibility of the final product of the cleaning/caring and the invisibility, along with the feminization and racialization (both going hand in hand), of the workers who do this cleaning/caring; between the growing industry of cleaning/caring and conceptions of clean/dirty, the gentrification of cities, and racialized environmental politics. To do so, I will discuss cleaning/caring through a different framework than that of labor (i.e., housework or domestic work).

Without the work of women of color, which is necessary but must remain invisible—literally and in valuative terms—neoliberal and patriarchal capitalism would not function. Upper class, white, neoliberal, and even liberal people must enter these spaces without having to acknowledge, to think of, to imagine, the work of cleaning/caring. It is a global situation and it is primarily white women who act as supervisors and regulators of this labor done by black and migrant/refugee women.

The contradiction and dialectic between the neoliberal bourgeoisie and these exhausted bodies illustrate the connections between neoliberalism, race, and heteropatriarchy. It also uncovers new borders that have been drawn between cleanliness and dirtiness in an age in which concerns are growing for clean air, clean water, clean houses, clean bodies, clean minds, and green spaces. The growing concern for a healthy/powerful body and mind is built on the New Age ideology of the 1970s, which appropriated Eastern and indigenous conceptions and practices, or esoteric Western ones. It has developed into a major and lucrative market, offering meditation and herbal teas, yoga and exotic whole grains, gyms and massages for every age, founded on class privilege and that very cultural appropriation. Its aim is personal efficiency and a maximization of physical and mental power. It has even fed a desire to outlive human constraints, and led to research programs for life extension, antiaging, and “solving the death problem,” financed by the theocracy of Silicon Valley. The owner of the performing body (white and male) is expected to demonstrate his willingness to spend long hours at the gym and in the office, to work late at night and during the weekend, this capacity being the sign of his success, of his adherence to the dominant order, his exhaustion the proof of his triumph over the basic needs of mere mortals. He performs neoliberal masculinity in a proudly under-rested body perpetually speeding through many tasks. The owner of the invisible body is female and a person of color. Her exhaustion is the consequence of the historical logic of extractivism that built primitive accumulation and capital—extracting labor from racialized bodies. Women who clean, whether they live in Maputo, Rio de Janeiro, Riyadh, Kuala Lumpur, Rabat, or Paris, speak of the very little time they sleep (three to four hours), of the long hours devoted to their commutes, and of the work they have to do once they return home. Women who perform caring/cleaning jobs all talk about being exhausted. The economy of exhaustion has a long history in the modern world: it started with colonial slavery, mining human energy to death; the Industrial Revolution adopted this logic, exhausting the bodies of white workers and children until they finally obtained a reduction of work hours and hard physical labor thanks to the exhaustion of racialized bodies in the colonies. Liberal and neoliberal countries still rest on mining to exhaustion the bodies of migrants and people of color (processes of racialization also occur in the countries of the Global South—Filipinas and Indonesian women cleaning/caring are racialized in Southeast Asia, as are Thai and Malagasy women in Beirut; one even hears wealthy Africans in Dakar speak of their “African” domestics).

The performing male neoliberal body has another kind of “phantom” body that enables his limitless performance. Even when a married white woman does her own housework and takes care of her own kids, the work of women of color must not be overlooked: they clean the spaces where white mothers do their shopping, buy their groceries, go the gym, drop off their children at daycare. This racial and gendered construction rests on a long history of the exploitation of black women in particular, of their bodies and souls. To be clear, I do not mean to make a rigid distinction between cleaning and caring. Cleaning is about caring, and caring about cleaning: black women who care for children and the elderly, and clean their bodies also take care of the environment by cleaning human waste and rubbish. The bodies of black women have long been commodified, made into capital; their exploitation is inseparable from primitive accumulation, from social reproduction (as so many black feminists have shown), and from the new need for a clean world in which the neoliberal economy can function. Who Cleans the World?
Though it is always problematic to speak of “a” group of women, to lump together so many different situations—residing in the home you clean, or cleaning public spaces for an agency; being undocumented or a citizen, or a migrant whose passport is confiscated; being married, living alone, or in a collective; being in a queer, lesbian, or heterosexual relationship; speaking the language of the society in which you work or not; being aware of your rights or not—I will, for the purposes of my argument, speak of black and brown women who clean and care as a group, in order to explore links between cleanliness and dirtiness in the age of neoliberalism and the so-called Anthropocene.

In this symbolic and material economy, black and brown women’s lives are made precarious and vulnerable, but their fabricated superfluity goes hand in hand with their necessary existence and presence. They are allowed into private homes and workplaces. But other members of superfluous communities—such as the families and neighbors of these workers—must stay behind the gates, unless they are willing to risk being killed by state police violence and other forms of the militarization of green and public spaces for the sake of the wealthy. For these workers, the special permit to enter is based both on the need for their work and on their invisibility. Women of color enter the gates of the city, of its controlled buildings, but they must do it as phantoms. Racialized women may circulate in the city, but only as an erased presence.

In their essay “Bio(necro)polis: Marx, Surplus Populations, and the Spatial Dialectics of Reproduction and ‘Race,’” Michael McIntyre and Heidi J. Nast introduce the notions of “bio(necro)polis” and “necro(bio)polis” to emphasize the geographical fluidity of accumulation and racialized difference. They study how surplus populations “are the effect of racially striated regimes of biological reproduction,” arguing “that the workings of capitalism must be understood in terms of the linked contradictions of reproduction and race.” They go on to write that

racial marking of lands and bodies continues to be a way of rendering certain bodies superfluous. Canalized, criminalized, ostracized, stigmatized, the necropolis—that spatiality through which the necropolitan is defined or constituted—becomes a reserve of multifarious material proportions: of negative symbolic potential and death’s liminal pleasures; a reserve of labor (as noted in chapter 25 of Capital); a nature reserve open for appropriation; a reserve of potentially fecund land for settlers; and a reserve of waste land for colonialism’s human and environmental detritus.

They add: “Members of the surplus laboring population working long hours for low wages are resented for undercutting white workers’ wages.” In the racial marking of the city, black women’s lives are superfluous and necessary, but their presence in the cleaning/caring industry has not in fact fueled resentment for taking white workers’ jobs or undercutting their wages. Indeed, the racial/gendered element of this workforce has not produced the kind of white resentment that we have observed in other industries. There is no nationalist, racist, anti-migrant movement built on the argument that “women of color are stealing white women’s jobs.” If the Islamophobic feminism that we witness in Europe has mobilized against veiled women in public spaces and daycare centers, it has not protested against veiled women who clean these public spaces or offices, hotel rooms, restaurants, and gyms. At the same time, there exists no protest movement in support of impoverished women who work cleaning/caring jobs—none. On the contrary, black women in particular have had to fight to get domestic work recognized as work by governments and unions. The fight is far from over."

A Reply to the Globalization Theory Debate
Justin Rosenberg
Department of IR and Politics, University of Sussex, Brighton BN19RH, UK.
E-mail: J.P.Rosenberg@sussex.ac.uk
This article replies to an earlier forum (International Politics (42.3) on
‘Globalization Theory: a Post Mortem’. Whereas the ’Post Mortem’ had criticized
Globalization Theory largely for its neglect of Classical Social Theory’s
achievements, the current paper emphasizes its reproduction of one of Classical
Social Theory’s greatest limitations: the failure to incorporate ‘the international’
into its theorization of historical development. This limitation, it is argued, may be
overcome using the idea of ’uneven and combined development’, an idea which is
first reformulated (in order to re-connect the premises of social and international
theory), and then used as a vantage point from which to respond to criticisms of the
‘Post Mortem’. ‘The international’, it turns out, is not the fading reality postulated
by Globalization Theory but rather a fundamental dimension of social existence
that IR, uniquely among the social sciences, encounters as its core subject matter.

Introduction
Some years ago, when I began teaching at LSE, the Master’s level international
theory lectures were in the capable hands of the late Philip Windsor. Eager to
learn the ropes, I asked him one day whether I might attend. To my surprise, he
told me that, as a matter of courtesy among colleagues, such mutual
surveillance was not encouraged. Undeterred, I asked whether, in that case,
he could at least tell me something of what was in the lectures, for I was curious
to know how he framed the subject. ‘Oh, you know’, came the laconic reply:
‘it’s the higher bullshit.’
There the conversation ended. Yet in my memory it gradually took on an
intellectual life of its own. For despite Windsor’s self-deprecating irony, the
phrase ‘higher bullshit’ had conjured up in my mind a prospect which has, over
time, preoccupied me more and more: the idea that there exists a level of
reflection at which the particular theoretical categories of International
Relations (IR) can be resolved into a more general, ‘supradisciplinary’ idiom,

www.palgrave-journals.com/ip
providing not just a point of integration with, but also a distinctive
contribution to the wider field of social theory. For a long time, the idea
was only a question: does IR actually have a ‘higher bullshit’ of its own in this
sense? Or does the question of ‘the international’, whatever its concrete
significance for particular empirical explanations, ultimately dissolve without
theoretical residue as one rises to the level of abstraction at which only
the most general premises of social theory remain? To put it another way: is
‘the international’ just a historically contingent sub-category of ‘the social’,
vacant of any general determinations of its own? Or does it, on the contrary,
have implications which reach, or should reach, back into the very definition of
‘the social’ itself?
It was en route to this latter suspicion that, as George Lawson and John
Hobson both suggest, ‘Globalization Theory: a Post Mortem’ marked a kind
of ‘way-station’. In subsequent work, I have been trying to formulate the
suspicion more systematically by interrogating Leon Trotsky’s ‘theory of
uneven and combined development’. And though still incomplete, that
interrogation provides the best vantage point from which to respond to the
very valuable replies to the ‘Post Mortem’ published in this journal. For it
turns out that much of the controversy over ‘globalization’ hangs on this
intellectually prior question of ‘the international’ — a question which, as Jan
Aart Scholte observed (2005a, 396), was never fully clarified in the ‘Post
Mortem’. Thus, before replying directly to my critics, I must briefly summarize
where my later work has been leading."

We must not underestimate the disintermediating, educational, emancipatory,
entertainment and informative potential of digital technologies. However, we
are beginning to realise the costs of reaching this potential as more people are
connecting to these technologies. In order to comprehend these costs, Marshall
McLuhan’s Understanding Media: The Extension of Man (1964) and Walter J.
Ong’s Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the World (Ong, 1982) are useful
points of reference. Applying historical and philosophical examinations, the two
authors ascertain the impact of a medium upon culture and society. By the same
token, Nicholas Carr’s 2010 work The Shallows: How the Internet is Changing the
Way We Think, Read and Remember (Carr, 2010) reasserts McLuhan’s and Ong’s
theses vis-à-vis the digital realm. More recently, analysing the inner workings of
the brain, evolutionary biologists, neuroscientists and psychologists have come to
comparable conclusions on the impact of digital technologies (Landon-Murray
and Anderson, 2013; Risko and Gilbert, 2016; Alter, 2017; Wolf, 2018).
The medium is the message, and with the possible exception of Gutenberg’s

printing press in the 1450s, the internet has instigated the most cultural and soci-
etal embodiment of mediation (van Loon, 2008). Examples of this include how,

compared to non-digital societies, citizens of digitised societies are more likely to
trigger their visual cortices, while merely skim through long-form essays (Carr,
2010). It is neither that the internet negates the written word nor that it does not

value it, but as a consequence of the extensive time users spend online access-
ing visual content, they gradually find it harder to concentrate and think deeply

about issues, preferring rather to engage with the mundane (ibid.). Nonetheless,
the issue that networked citizens are more prone to engage with visually aesthetic
content fails to provide a complete picture of the internet’s accumulated impact.

Introduction

2 Introduction
With the advent of smartphones and social media platforms, online technologies
are changing how and what we consume, how we feel, how we think, how we
remember, how we see and, now, if, who and what to believe (O’Connor and
Weatherall, 2018). Ultimately, the gradual rewiring of our brains has made our
online and offline behaviours unpredictable at best, irrational at worst.
On a consumer level, lifestyle categories and self-objectifications of young
adults looking to achieve more ‘followers’ and ‘likes’ raises serious concerns

regarding the direction of digital media. As worrying as this is, internet inter-
mediaries have focused on other issues rather than self-reform. In fact, their

objectives are directly antithetical to these concerns since their overall purpose is
to transform our brains’ neuroplasticity and keep us ‘hooked’ in order to spend
more hours within and across their ever-expanding platforms (Wu, 2016). In

doing so, they can increase advertising expenditure while drawing users in, cre-
ating, as they do, highly impactful network effects. This mitigates shareholder

pressure and keeps profits rising. As a result, most current online ecosystems are
endemic to commodity fetishisms. Paradoxically, these were the same concerns

of the early workings of the Frankfurt School, concerns that led to critically eval-
uating legacy media consumptions within capitalist systems. Marcuse’s views of

technology as a manifestation of a ‘bourgeois ideology’ (1968: 223) is pertinent,
even today, in thinking critically about our consumptions of digital cultural
texts. The same is true of the ‘standardisation’ witnessed across these platforms

(Adorno and Leppert, 2002). Similarly, critical discussions on the cultural pro-
duction of digital media remain imperative. For example, Fuchs’ (2018) efforts in

revisiting the critical cultural production theories of advertising in a digitalised

environment is a welcome contribution. So too is Edwards (2018) on the politi-
cal economy of public relations in the digital age and Nicoli (2012; Nicoli, 2013)

on the erosion of public service television production values within a globalised
digital context.
As relevant as consumer-level critical analysis is, it is on a citizenship level
that our warnings need to be heeded. Encapsulating the logic of this volume is
that, rather than attempting to stop a vessel’s leaks, we should first be steering
clear of the iceberg staring directly at us. Consequently, the caveats made in this
volume render critical analyses of the system of production and consumption
of culture a subordinated concern. The focus of this volume is toward a crisis
in democracy rather than of the capitalist system, although the two, no doubt,
interrelate on numerous levels. In fact, the association between capitalism and

the liberal democratic order has vastly contributed to the neoliberal turn respon-
sible for much of what is wrong today in our democracies (Srnicek and Williams,

2016). Nonetheless, it is the Frankfurt School’s latter works that have been this
volume’s central conceptual framework. Described in detail in Chapter Two,
Jürgen Habermas’ normative model of democracy created a point of reference
for how we should strive for liberal democracy. It gave us an understanding
of the duties of civil society, the impact of universal systems of representation
and the value of communicative action. Rather than moving in this direction,

Introduction 3
we have conversely seen the rise of other systems of government, most notably
those of populist, autocratic-leaning regimes. As a result, scholarly focus has

turned toward explorations concerning the expansion of populism (for exam-
ple, Ingelhart and Norris, 2016; Eatwell and Goodwin, 2018) and examinations

regarding the role of digital democracy and disinformation in its growth (Flew
and Iosifidis, 2020; Iosifidis and Andrews, 2020).
Digital disinformation has indeed been a critical factor in democracy’s
decline, and we must again remind ourselves of the work of McLuhan and Ong

concerning the repercussions a new medium can have upon societies, particu-
larly one that had such high emancipatory potential. Lewandowsky, Ecker and

Cook (2017) identify several reasons behind the growth of digital disinforma-
tion, including a decline in the social capital of citizens, the political and social

polarisation of contemporary everyday life, rises in inequality, distrust in media
and an overall cynicism toward government. All have played out over digital
media and are therefore addressed in this volume. Rather than mediated citizens
using the internet’s vast potential to share thoughts across virtual spaces and open
up to diverse viewpoints, they choose to selectively expose the aforementioned
issues that matter to them individually rather than to society as a whole. In other
words, in the current structure of digital media (for example, the way in which
social media algorithms are applied), online-mediated citizens use these tools to
confirm their own biases. In doing so, they create online ‘camps’ that amplify
distrust and widen polarisation. As users generate content, they become more
disposed to make up or use fake content to persuade others and make their own
points more persuasive. Such a vicious cycle and ominous consequence will be
familiar to social scientists studying group dynamics. In the 1970s, psychologist
David G. Myers demonstrated that when situating two polarised groups together
to discuss issues, they gradually become more hostile and polarised toward each
other (Myers, 1975). The application of this phenomenon on a scale of billions is
in fact how we have found ourselves steering toward the iceberg. The new global order and the role of internet intermediaries
The trajectory of liberal democracy
Human progress over the past 300 years has been impressive (Pinker, 2018).

Enlightenment ideals of reason have spread across the globe, creating more elec-
toral democracies in more advanced, educated, healthy and, ultimately, happier

societies. As Barack Obama famously pointed out (2016), ‘if you had to choose
a moment in history to be born ... you’d choose now’. Within numerous liberal
democracies created over this space of time, the growth in equal rights across the

spectrum of race, religion, gender and sexual orientation has truly been remark-
able. Despite these achievements, liberalism as we know it today, one of toler-
ance and universality, has had to fight off the assault of several regimes. As the

liberal order spread in the twentieth century, it found itself having to fend off
Communism, Nazism and, later on, Islamic fundamentalism. Nonetheless, its

4 Introduction
perseverance led to its most fundamental moment – the fall of the Berlin Wall
and the dismantlement of the USSR. Liberal democracy has since spread across
the globe at an extremely fast rate, offering hope of what a fair and tolerant world
could look like. Freedom House noted (2019: 1),
Between 1988 and 2005, the percentage of countries ranked Not Free in

Freedom in the World dropped by almost 14 points (from 37 to 23 per-
cent), while the share of Free countries grew (from 36 to 46 percent).

The 2008 global financial crisis and the rising inequality it has resulted in have
allowed today’s authoritarian, dogmatic regimes to rear their ugly heads and has
brought democracies a step closer to resembling them. This is because as liberal

democracies have become contaminated by neoliberal versions of itself, toler-
ance and universalism have ironically exposed their weaknesses. ‘If liberalism

is tolerant of divergences of opinion’, asks Turner (2003: 6), ‘how does it deal
with opinions that abhor tolerance? To what extent can liberal regimes tolerate
enemies from within, such as parties that reject the liberal rules of the game,
the conventions of discussion that make persuasion possible?’ Such a critical
dilemma becomes a catalytically component of why polarisation and populism
have grown, since the question asked by Turner is in fact embedded within the
core of the liberal order. Neoliberal proceedings have exacerbated the conditions
of the poorer classes and squeezed those in the middle.
As a result, social and political life is in a state of flux. Nations are turning
inward to protect themselves from what they see as highly uncertain times. As

populism continues to grow, it has given an opportunity to sovereign, inward-
thinking leaders to strike a chord with many voters who feel let down by both

the left and the right. Donald Trump’s rise to political power in the US and
the UK’s Brexit vote took many by surprise. Yet for a few others (for example
Fukuyama, 2018), the two events, and others like it, have been consequences
rather than determinants of liberalism’s breakdown, arguing that its demise has
been grounded in the growth of identity politics that have shifted alliances away

from bipartisan associations to socio-economic tribal ones (ibid.). This trajec-
tory, warns Gessen (2020), is the first step towards autocracy."

In 1776, the English reaction to the American Declaration of Independence
took 50 days to filter back to the United States. By 1991, global viewers were
watching broadcasts of Operation Desert Storm (the US–led invasion of
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait) in real time. Today, most of us take for granted the
immediate availability of news from around the world, with an enormous
variety of sources available to us quite literally at the push of a few buttons on
our smartphones or laptops. The immediate and constantly changing updates
on the Covid-19 pandemic offer a prime example.

In the last generation, the mass media have become more globalized, frag-
mented and interactive (McNair, 2018), and while we understand some of the

effects of these changes, the others are still evolving, and much that we once
thought of as fairly predictable has become volatile and unpredictable. Most
worryingly, while the news has always been exploited and distorted to political
ends, the extent of that distortion has grown and the means used to change the
message have become more sophisticated.
Although the changes are now coming thick and fast, the rise of mass media

has been a relatively recent development, dating back no more than two centu-
ries (see Table 12.1). The Gutenberg press started printing with moveable type in

1453, and the first newspaper appeared (in what is now Germany) in 1605, but
most of what we consider mass media came with developments in technology
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, allowing communication at the mass
level. This meant a shared experience for dispersed populations, providing a glue
to connect the citizens of states and other large political units.

First came the emergence during the nineteenth and early twentieth centu-
ries of mass-circulation newspapers, encouraged by widespread literacy in shared

languages. The primacy of newspapers was supplanted in the twentieth century

290 CHAPTER 12

USING THEORY 12
MEDIA THEORIES

Just as there are competing arguments about the impact of the media on the con-
struction and shaping of political realities, so there are competing theories about

how best to understand the relationship between media and politics more gener-
ally. One way of looking at media theories and comparing their arguments is to

place them in chronological order (see Ward, 2015).
■ The earliest view of the press was the authoritarian theory that – in the West,
at least – once explained the attitudes of monarchs, the military, church officials
and other elite groups. The goal of the press, in this view, was to enhance the
power of the ruler, an idea that evolved during the twentieth century into
totalitarian and communist ideas about the press as a vehicle for propaganda.
It has since evolved into the view in authoritarian regimes that the media exist
to serve the state, not the people.
■ The free press or libertarian theory emerged in the eighteenth century with

claims that newspapers spoke for the people, and that there should be free-
dom of public expression. It evolved into the view that all media should be free

to operate in an open marketplace of ideas, without interference by the gov-
ernment. In reality, this was no more than an ideal, because governments inter-
vened – and continue to intervene – when they feel that security or stability

are threatened, or when social interests come into conflict.
■ During the twentieth century, social responsibility theory emerged, emphasizing
the accountability of the media to society. Although they were free, they should
also serve the public good by providing reliable and comprehensive news and
acting as a forum for diverse values and opinions.
■ Since then, new theoretical views about the media have evolved, including
development theory (media freedom is important, but less so than the demands
of political, economic and social development), and alternative media theory

(those media are best that are closest to grassroots society, and that are small-
scale, non-commercial and participatory).

In practice, most countries can be studied and compared using a combination

of these theoretical approaches, reflecting the variety of media types and the vari-
ety of roles that different media play in the lives of citizens.

by broadcasting: cinema newsreels, radio and then television enabled commu-
nication with the mass public to take place in a spoken and personal form

rather than a written and more abstract form, and the news was increasingly live

rather than hours or days old. Communication also went international, begin-
ning slowly in the 1920s with the development of shortwave radio, first used

by Britain and the Netherlands to broadcast to their empires and then by Nazi
Germany, the United States, the Soviet Union and other major Western states.

The impact of broadcasting was at first relatively benign, with a small num-
ber of national radio and television channels dominating the airwaves after World

THE MEDIA 291

War II, providing a shared experience of national events and popular entertain-
ment. More dramatic was the impact of broadcasting on politicians themselves.

While a public speech to a live audience encouraged expansive words and dra-
matic gestures, a quieter tone was needed for transmission from the broadcasting

studio direct to the living room. The art was to talk to the millions as though

they were individuals, an approach exemplified by President Franklin Roo-
sevelt’s ‘fireside chats’, broadcast live by radio to the American population in the

1930s. The impact of his folksy idiom was undeniable, and he talked less to the
citizens than as a citizen, thereby earning political trust. In this way, broadcasting
– and radio, specifically – transformed not only the reach, but also the style, of
political communication.
This was even more true of television when it began to take off in the 1950s,
obliging candidates and leaders to think not just about what they were saying,
but also about how they looked while they were saying it. This was first brought
home forcefully with the televised Nixon–Kennedy debates during the 1960
presidential election in the United States. Although there were four debates,
it was the first that attracted the most analysis. Kennedy appeared healthy and
relaxed while Nixon appeared nervous and unwell, and while a majority of
those who watched the debate on television felt that Kennedy had performed

best, a majority of those who listened on radio thought that Nixon had per-
formed best. Television now moved to the centre of political campaigning, with

enormous care taken over how candidates and leaders presented themselves.

Date Changes and effects
Late 19th and early 20th
century

Popular newspapers emerge, often with mass circulation.

1930s The rise of radio greatly cuts the amount of time it takes for news to spread and
allows politicians for the first time to broadcast directly into the homes of voters.
1950s–1960s Television becomes the most popular mass medium, but there were few channels

at first, and most of the news was local.

1970s–1980s TV audiences begin to fragment with an increase in the number of channels,

distribution by cable and satellite and the use of video.

1990s International communication broadens with the rise of the internet, mobile phone

use and 24-hour global television news.

2000s Mobile phones begin to replace landlines and access expands to low-income

countries. Sharp decline in readership of printed newspapers.

2010s Continued expansion of social media, extending horizontal communication among
citizens. The internet typically accessed via smartphones and structured television
choices increasingly replaced by streaming.

Early 2020s Smartphones and laptops are preferred devices for most people in wealthier
communities, digital video catches up with broadcast television, print media
continue to decline (von Abrams, 2020).

292 CHAPTER 12

Broadcasting also made a substantial contribution to political communi-
cation in low-income countries, thanks to its two major advantages over print

media: it does not require physical distribution to users and is accessible to peo-
ple who cannot read. These factors came into play with the spread of radio

and then of satellite television as distant villagers were able to gather around a
shared set to hear or watch the latest news. In many countries there was only
one state-owned channel each for radio and television and the opening item on
the news typically focused on the activities of national leaders, no matter how
unimportant.
The globalization of political communication was exemplified by the rise

of global 24-hour television news. This began with the creation of national all-
news stations such as CNN, which began broadcasting in the United States in

1980. It was followed by CNN International in 1985, and then by BBC World
(1991), Deutsche Welle from Germany (1992), Al Jazeera from Qatar (1996),
NHK World from Japan (1998), RT from Russia (2005) and France 24 (2006).

These stations have not always been profitable, and they reach only those audi-
ences that have access to cable or satellite, but global television broadens the

options for sources of political information and also encourages a more global
view of political issues.
All of these changes, which happened in just a matter of decades, were
overwhelmed in the 1990s with the birth and growth of digital technology.
This has had the effect of throwing a series of rocks into the pond of political

The rise of 24-hour global television is exemplified by the story of Al Jazeera,
headquartered in Qatar but whose programming is available all over the world,
and which has offices and journalists in multiple countries.

communication: it has created ripples and disturbances that often make it diffi-
cult to see into the reaches of the pond in order to establish the effects. This has

all happened in a remarkably short period of time: the first commercial internet
providers date back only to the 1980s, the World Wide Web was created in 1989,
Google was founded in 1998, Wi-Fi emerged a year later, and most of the sites,
habits, and expectations that we now associate with social media are barely
into their second decade of existence; see Table 12.2.
Although many of us now live in a social media world, it is important to
appreciate that access to the internet is far from equal. Between 2005 and 2019,
internet use grew from 17 per cent to 51 per cent of the world’s population,
but while rates of connection were as high as 83 per cent in Europe and 77 per
cent in the Americas, only 45 per cent of people were connected in Asia and the
Pacific, and 29 per cent in Africa (see Chapter 13 for more details). For many of
those who are unconnected, it is a problem of lacking access to electricity and/
or computers and/or smart phones and/or broadband services, while others live
in authoritarian regimes that limit and censor the internet, and there are many
people who do not use the internet for news or use it only in a selective manner.
There are also important differences in internet access within communities
and countries: younger people are more connected to the internet than older
people, for example, hinting at generational changes yet to come, while there is a
notable urban–rural divide (see Figure 12.3) that accentuates the dominant role
of towns and cities discussed in the last chapter. It might also be suggested that
the Western dominance of the internet has created a new form of information
imperialism, although the balance has been changing with the rise of Chinese
equivalents (Jin, 2015). These include Baidu (a search engine), Weibo (equivalent
to Twitter), Taobao (an online market) and Youku (equivalent to YouTube).
One of the more dramatic effects of the rise of social media has been the
advent of interactivity in the provision of news. Radio phone-ins have long
allowed ordinary people to listen to their peers discussing current issues; social
media perform the same function in cyberspace to much bigger and wider
audiences. Messaging systems and social media allow peer-to-peer interchanges
which tend to crowd out top-down communication from politicians to voters. A

294 CHAPTER 12

new generation that has known little but interactive media is raising an impor-
tant question to which politicians have yet to find an adequate answer: why

should we listen to you when we have the option to interact electronically with
others who share our interests?
The political implications of these transitions are substantial. Where earlier
generations would passively watch whatever appeared on their television screen
and read news in their newspapers that was often no longer new, digital news is
user-driven and constantly updated. In response, political leaders and parties are
using a greater range and sophistication of marketing strategies, including the
use of personalized but expensive contact techniques via email, texts and social

media. In this more fragmented media environment, politicians have to com-
pete for followers on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter with sports personalities,

movie stars and reality TV shows. The sound bite, never unimportant, becomes
even more vital as politicians learn to articulate their agenda in a short interview
or an even briefer commercial.
If it was only well-meaning humans who were determining the pace and
the quality of the interaction, then we could see this as a healthy development in
the marketplace of ideas. Unfortunately, many who mean harm are also involved
in this interactivity, and – as we will see later in this chapter – the definition of

‘news’ has increasingly been influenced by those seeking to mislead and has been
defined more narrowly than before."
"Summarize the following text in bullet points. Do not include any information that is not in the original text. Perhaps you have never imagined what it would feel like if you
were a woman fl eeing your home with your young children,
escaping a violent confl ict between government troops and rebel
soldiers, crossing a national border, pitching a tent in a muddy
refugee camp, and then being treated by aid staff workers as
though you and the children you are supporting were indistinguishable, “womenandchildren.”
Maybe, if any of your aunts or grandmothers have told you
stories about having worked as domestic servants, you can more
easily picture what your daily life would be like if you had left
your home country to take a live-in job caring for someone else’s
little children or their aging parents. You can almost imagine
the emotions you would feel if you were to Skype across time
zones to your own children every week, but you cannot be sure
how you would react when your employer insisted upon taking
possession of your passport.
It probably feels like a stretch to see yourself working in a
disco outside a foreign military base. It is hard to think about
chapter one

Round
Where Are the Women?
2 / Gender Makes the World Go Round
how you would try to preserve some modicum of dignity for
yourself in the narrow space left between the sexualized expectations of your foreign male soldier-clients and the demands of
the local disco owner who takes most of your earnings.
While you might daydream about becoming a senior foreign
policy expert in your country’s diplomatic corps, you may deliberately shy away from thinking about whether you will be able
to sustain a relationship with a partner while you pursue this
ambition. You try not to think about whether your partner will
be willing to cope with both diplomacy’s social demands and
the pressures you together will endure living in a proverbial
media fi shbowl.
If you keep up with the world news, you may be able to put
yourself in the shoes of a women’s rights activist in Cairo, but
 Figure 1. Egyptian women protesting sexual harassment hold
up signs in Arabic and English, Cairo, 2013. Photo: OPantiSH.
Gender Makes the World Go Round / 3
how would you decide whether to paint your protest sign only
in Arabic or to add an English translation of your political message just so that CNN and Reuters viewers around the world
can see that your revolutionary agenda includes not only toppling the current oppressive regime but also pursuing specifi -
cally feminist goals?
As hard as this will be, it will take all of this imagining—and
more—if you are going to make reliable sense of international
politics. Stretching your imagination, though, will not be enough.
Making feminist sense of international politics requires that you
exercise genuine curiosity about each of these women’s lives—
and the lives of women you have yet to think about. And that
curiosity will have to fuel energetic detective work, careful digging into the complex experiences and ideas of domestic workers,
hotel chambermaids, women’s rights activists, women diplomats,
women married to diplomats, women who are the mistresses of
male elites, women sewing-machine operators, women who have
become sex workers, women soldiers, women forced to become
refugees, and women working on agribusiness plantations.
That is, making useful sense—feminist sense—of international politics requires us to follow diverse women to places that
are usually dismissed by conventional foreign aff airs experts as
merely “private,” “domestic,” “local,” or “trivial.” As we will discover, however, a disco can become an arena for international
politics. So can someone else’s kitchen or your own closet.
And so can a secretary’s desk. Consider, for instance, women
who work as secretaries in foreign aff airs ministries. They are
treated by most political commentators as if they were no more
interesting than the standard-issue furniture. But women as
secretaries have played interesting roles in international events
as signifi cant as the controversial Iran-Contra Aff air, which
4 / Gender Makes the World Go Round
exposed the clandestine American military intervention in
Nicaragua in the 1980s, and as the secret Israel-Palestine peace
negotiations in Oslo in the 1990s. Who pays attention to women
as clerical workers when, allegedly, it is elite men (and a handful
of elite women) who determine the fates of nations? Feminist
researchers do. They challenge the conventional presumption
that paying attention to women as secretaries tells us nothing
about the dynamics of high-level politics. Feminist-informed
investigators pay attention to low-status secretarial women
because they have learned that paying attention to (listening to,
taking seriously the observations of) women in these scarcely
noticed jobs can pull back the curtain on the political workings
in lofty state aff airs. Devoting attention to women who are government secretaries, for instance, exposes the far-reaching
political consequences of feminized loyalty, feminized secrecy,
feminized record-keeping, feminized routine, masculinized status, and masculinized control.1
Thanks to innovative research by feminist-informed scholars,
we know to look for secretaries throughout international politics.
For instance, we recently have learned that in the 1920s and 1930s,
some enterprising women—German, British, Dutch—pursued
jobs in the newly launched League of Nations, the international
organization founded in the wake of horrifi c World War I to
remake interstate relations. These women were breaking new
ground not only by becoming the fi rst international civil servants but also by, as women, pursuing their own careers far from
home. Working as secretaries and also as librarians, these women
were the ones who ensured that the League of Nations documents would be produced and archived professionally. Because
of these staff women’s eff orts, we now can launch our provocative
reassessments of the League as a site not only for preventing war
Gender Makes the World Go Round / 5
but also for promoting international social justice. These women
did not think of themselves as furniture.2
Some women, of course, have not been treated as furniture.
Among those women who have become visible in the recent
era’s international political arena are Hillary Clinton, Mary
Robinson, Angela Merkel, Christine Lagarde, Michelle Bachelet, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, and Shirin Ebadi.3
 Each of these
prominent women has her own gendered stories to tell (or, perhaps, to deliberately not tell). But a feminist-informed investigation makes it clear that there are far more women engaged in
international politics than the conventional headlines imply.
Millions of women are international actors, and most of them
are not Shirin Ebadi or Hillary Clinton.
To make reliable sense of today’s (and yesterday’s) dynamic
international politics calls both for acquiring new skills and for
redirecting skills one already possesses. That is, making feminist sense of international politics necessitates gaining skills that
feel quite new and redirecting skills that one has exercised
before, but which one assumed could shed no light on wars, economic crises, global injustices, and elite negotiations. Investigating the workings of masculinities and femininities as they each
shape complex international political life—that is, conducting a
gender-curious investigation—will require a lively curiosity,
genuine humility, a full tool kit, and candid refl ection on potential misuses of those old and new research tools.4
Most of all, one has to become interested in the actual lives—
and thoughts—of complicatedly diverse women. One need not
necessarily admire every woman whose life one fi nds interesting.
Feminist attentiveness to all sorts of women is not derived from
hero worship. Some women, of course, will turn out to be insightful, innovative, and even courageous. Upon closer examination,
6 / Gender Makes the World Go Round
other women will prove to be complicit, intolerant, or selfserving. The motivation to take all women’s lives seriously lies
deeper than admiration. Asking “Where are the women?” is
motivated by a determination to discover exactly how this world
works. One’s feminist-informed digging is fueled by a desire to
reveal the ideas, relationships, and policies those (usually
unequal) gendered workings rely upon.
For example, a British woman decides to cancel her plans for
a winter holiday in Egypt. She thinks Egypt is “exotic,” the
warm weather would be welcome, and cruising down the Nile
sounds exciting; but she is nervous about political upheaval in
the wake of the overthrow of Egypt’s previous regime. So
instead she books her winter vacation in Jamaica. In making her
tourism plans, she is playing her part in creating the current
international political system. She is further deepening Egypt’s
fi nancial debt while helping a Caribbean government earn badly
needed foreign currency. And no matter which country she
chooses for her personal pleasure, she is transforming “chambermaid” into a major globalized job category.
Or consider an American elementary school teacher who
designs a lesson plan to feature the Native American “princess”
Pocahontas. Many of the children will have watched the Disney
animated movie. Now, the teacher hopes, she can show children
how this seventeenth-century Native American woman saved
the Englishman John Smith from execution at Jamestown, Virginia, later converted to Christianity, married an English planter,
and helped clear the way for the English colonization of America.
(The teacher might also include in her lesson plan the fact that
Pocahontas’s 1614 marriage to John Rolfe was the fi rst recorded
interracial marriage in what was to become the United Sates.)
Her young students might come away from their teacher’s well-
Gender Makes the World Go Round / 7
intentioned lesson having absorbed the myth that local women
are easily charmed by their own people’s foreign occupiers.
The lives of Hollywood actresses can take on new international import when viewed through a feminist analytical lens.
For example, in the 1930s, Hollywood moguls turned the innovative Brazilian singer Carmen Miranda into an American
movie star. Then they put Miranda to work bolstering President
Franklin Roosevelt’s eff orts to promote friendlier relations
between the United States and Latin America. Soon after, an
international banana company made her image into their logo,
creating a new, intimate relationship between American housewives and a multinational plantation company. Today, however,
Carmen Miranda has become an archetype of a certain overthe-top Latinized femininity. Men and women dress up with
fantastic fruit-adorned hats and put their Carmen Miranda
look-alike images up on YouTube and their Facebook pages.
Or consider the implications of a gendered encounter between
a foreign male soldier and an impoverished, local woman today:
an American—or Australian or Canadian or Ugandan—male
soldier on an international peacekeeping or humanitarian mission responds to his comrades’ homophobic innuendos by fi nally
going along with them to a local brothel in order to prove that he
is “one of the boys.” Though he may think of himself as simply
bolstering his own manly credentials, his attempts to compensate for his insecure masculine identity help shape power relations between his country’s military and the society it is supposed to be protecting. He is also reinforcing one of the crucial
bulwarks of today’s militarized international political relations:
heterosexualized masculinity.
The woman tourist and the chambermaid; the schoolteacher
and her students; the fi lm star, her studio owners, the banana
8 / Gender Makes the World Go Round
company executives, the American housewife, and contemporary YouTube enthusiasts; the male soldier, the brothel owner,
and the woman working as a prostitute—all are dancing an
intricate international minuet. Those who look closely at the
gendered causes and the gendered consequences of that minuet
are conducting a feminist investigation of today’s international
political system.
These “dancers,” however, are not in a position to call the
tune. Yet even a woman who is victimized is not mindless. It is
crucial to this feminist-informed investigation into unequal
international relations that we not create a false (and lazy)
dichotomy between the allegedly “mindless victim” and the
allegedly “empowered actor.” Women who are pushed to the far
margin of any power system continue to assess and strategize
even with the minimal resources they have available; sometimes
they move beyond private strategizing to collective organizing.
Nonetheless, acknowledging the severely restricted agency
exercised by women pushed to the margins is not to deny that
some international actors wield a lot more infl uence and garner
far more rewards than do others. Thus, to investigate the gendered workings of international politics we will have to make
power visible—power in all its myriad forms. This exploration
can be uncomfortable."

([sagepub.com](http://sagepub.com/))

POINT OF THE ARTICLE: discusses Carr’s critique of idealism in IR

- Carr’s main argument: Idealism is flawed (especially the belief that international politics can be governed by moral principles like cooperation and law)
- Carr laid the foundation for realism

THESIS: Carr’s critique of idealism in IR is still relevant today

- it challenged dominant idealistic thinking of the time
- Debate between realism vs. idealism is still relevant today and so is his critique
    - Both idealism and realism have evolved, but the fundamental debate remains relevant and at the core of IR (tension between moral values and power politics)
    - it was not just relevant at his time, it is still a core debate today
- World needs a mix of both realism and idealism today
    - to overcome challenges like climate change, global governance…

### Carr’s criticism of idealism → laid foundation for realism

Idealism: 

- overly optimistic, naive → ignores how power and self-interest truly shapes international politics

Realism:

- Emphasised competitive and conflictual nature of international politics
- States pursue their interests primarily through power, not morality
    - E.g. League of Nations failed, because of it’s overemphasis on moral objectives and not understanding the reality of power politics Ashworth, L. M. (2006). Where are the idealists in interwar international relations?. *Review of International Studies*, *32*(2), 291-308.

POINT OF THE ARTICLE: analyses and challenges the historical narrative of ir: common belief that idealism was the dominant approach in the interwar period & that it failed because it does not work that well → however, it is more complex & diverse than that

THESIS: we should re-evaluate the historical narrative of how IR developed: we should move beyond the simplistic realism-idealism binary → to more nuanced understanding of how IR developed through a diversity of different approaches (and not just IR = idealism that failed and then realism took over, because it is much better)

### Common belief

- Idealism dominated in the interwar period (between WWI & WWII)
- Later displaced by realism (after failure of League of Nations and outbreak of WWII)
- Idealism: was seen as naive and moralistic & later discredited after failure of IOs in 1930s

### Was idealism truly dominant in interwar period?

- NO → There was no ONE coherent school of thought (’idealism’) during interwar period → there were many different, diverse theories that were all grouped under ‘idealism’
    - labelling them as ‘idealists’ oversimplifies what they did
    - they were in fact: critical of being too positive/naive and sought realistic/pragmatic solutions to int. problems
- Interwar period: intellectually rich & diverse: theories could not purely be categorised as ‘realist’ or ‘idealist’ → overlapped/both used at the same time

### Realism better than idealism?

- Carr’s critique of Idealism → led to the rise of Realism
    - However, Carr’s description of idealism: exagarrated & ignored diversity within idealism
- Definitions of realism vs idealism at the time oversimplify the intellectual debates at the time
    - Realism: was seen as more scientific
    - Idealism: more moralistic (impractical dreamers)
- Idealists at the time were not impractical dreamers, but were concerned with real-world issues → balance ethical concerns & practical approaches
- Realists: criticised idealists’ faith in IOs → but idealists themselves were also critical of League of Nations
- Realism became dominant because it framed the failures of interwar idealism as inevitable → not the whole truth
    - Triumph of realism → creation of this narrative that idealism failed → led to overshadowing the diversity of interwar theories

MAIN ARGUMENT:

- Carr completely messed up the political map
    - because he uses ‘idealism’ and utopianism’ synonymously
    - and used idealism is a ‘slur’ for liberalism, socialism… to downplay their relevance
    - there was so much diversity in theory in the interwar period: but he put them all under the word ‘idealism’ and therefore downplayed all the work they did by labelling them as ‘impractical dreamers’ Thakur, V., Davis, A. E., & Vale, P. (2017). Imperial mission, ‘scientific’ method: an alternative account of the origins of IR. *Millennium*, *46*(1), 3-23.

POINT OF THE ARTICLE: reevaluates the origins of IR & how IR did not emerge only in response to WWI, but it is rooted in imperialism & colonial interests

- IR's early thinkers were not just concerned with peace and conflict between European states but also with maintaining imperial control over colonised regions

THESIS: IR’s cannot be fully understood without considering it’s imperial origins → how does these origins still influence IR today?

- IR’s origins must be reevaluated → take into account it’s imperial context where it emerged → for more accurate understanding of IR
    - Global IR = incorporates perspectives from the Global South and recognises the importance of colonial histories in shaping it, less Eurocentric

Dominant narrative of IR’s origin:

- emerged in response to WWI to create peace → portrays IR as discipline that is a rational, scientific response to the problems of war and peace between European powers

→ DOMINANT NARRATIVE OVERLOOKS IMPERIAL CONTEXT OF THE TIME:

### **Imperialism played key role in shaping early IR thought**

- IR developed PARALLEL with efforts to manage empires and maintain control over the colonised
    - justified through scientific language and ‘progress’
- ‘Scientific’ methods in early IR: not neutral, but shaped by need to justify imperial domination
    - International system = presented to reinforce European superiority & legitimacy of colonial rule
- British colonialism & imperial interests deeply impacted IR
- IR in interwar period: not just concerned with peace & security of Europe → also with maintaining imperial control over colonies
- IR = Eurocentric
    - blind to the experiences & perspectives of the colonised
    - international system only framed through lens of European power and interests
- Race embedded in IR’s supposedly ‘objective’ analyses → neocolonialism
    - race & racial hierarchies central to the way early IR scholars understood global politics
- IR’s racist history:
    - historically early IR theories often relied on racial categories to justify European dominance
    - this aspect of IR’s history → overlooked by contemporary/mainstream scholarship
- Marginalisation of non-European perspectives:
    - systematically excluded → leading to a distorted understanding of IR that prioritised European experiences and interests
- Realism too (not only idealism, as it has been criticised for) was shaped by imperialism & continued to marginalise non_western perspectives

MAIN ARGUMNET:

- early IR scholars didn’t intentionally create IR to make it colonial/imperial and with the goal to legitimise colonial rule to further oppress the colonised and remain dominant
- how IR was created was instead a consequence of the racial bias at the time:
    - early IR scholars had intrenched racism which shaped their view of the world
    - imperialism Du Bois, W.E.B. ‘The African roots of war’, *Monthly Review* 24(11) 1973, pp.28–40.

In *""The African Roots of War""*, W.E.B. Du Bois explores how the exploitation and colonization of Africa were central to the outbreak of World War I. He argues that the imperialist competition for African resources and labor contributed to the tensions between European powers, ultimately leading to conflict.

Du Bois emphasizes that Africa was not merely a backdrop to European politics but a vital source of wealth, particularly in raw materials and cheap labor. European powers scrambled to dominate African territories, leading to intense rivalries and militarization. The article links colonialism in Africa with the broader capitalist system, arguing that European countries profited enormously from the exploitation of African people and land, and this profit fueled the imperialist ambitions that led to war.

Additionally, Du Bois addresses the role of race in this process. He argues that European imperialism was justified by racist ideologies that portrayed Africans as inferior and in need of ""civilization."" These racial ideologies helped to mask the economic motivations behind colonization and facilitated the brutal exploitation of African societies.

Du Bois concludes by stressing that the exploitation of Africa and its people was not only a driving factor behind World War I but also a key element in the global capitalist system, which perpetuates inequality and conflict. He calls for greater recognition of Africa’s significance in world history and for solidarity among oppressed peoples to challenge the imperialist structures that persist.

In sum, Du Bois’s text highlights the deep interconnections between imperialism, capitalism, race, and war, using Africa as a crucial case study for understanding the global forces at play in the early 20th century.

1. **Introduction**: Du Bois begins by outlining the central argument of the article, which is that the exploitation of Africa was a fundamental cause of World War I. He suggests that competition over African colonies created tensions among European powers, leading to war.
2. **Imperialism and Capitalism**: Du Bois connects European imperialism in Africa with the rise of capitalism. He argues that European countries were driven to conquer African lands for their economic resources—minerals, raw materials, and cheap labor—which were essential to fueling industrial capitalism.
3. **The Scramble for Africa**: This paragraph describes the scramble for African colonies that began in the late 19th century. Du Bois explains how European powers divided Africa among themselves, engaging in fierce competition to control its vast wealth and natural resources.
4. **Africa’s Wealth**: Du Bois highlights the immense economic value of Africa to European powers, emphasizing its wealth in terms of resources such as diamonds, gold, rubber, and other materials crucial for European industrial growth. He shows that Africa was not a marginal region but central to European economic expansion.
5. **Labor and Exploitation**: The article discusses how European powers exploited African labor to extract resources. Du Bois notes that this exploitation was often brutal and dehumanizing, with Africans subjected to forced labor, violence, and racial oppression as part of the colonial system.
6. **Racial Justifications for Colonialism**: Du Bois addresses the role of race in justifying imperialism. He argues that Europeans used racist ideologies to legitimize the colonization of Africa, portraying Africans as backward and in need of European civilization, thus masking the true economic motivations behind imperialism.
7. **Militarization and War**: Du Bois links European militarization to the competition over African colonies. He explains how European powers built up their military forces to defend and expand their colonial empires, which contributed to the rise of nationalism and, ultimately, the outbreak of war.
8. **African Contributions to the War**: Du Bois points out that African soldiers and resources played a significant role in World War I. Many African colonies were used as sources of troops and supplies for the European war effort, yet their contributions were often ignored or undervalued by the colonial powers.
9. **Capitalism, Imperialism, and War**: In this paragraph, Du Bois reiterates that the capitalist system, driven by profit and exploitation, is at the root of both imperialism and war. He argues that the struggle for control over Africa is part of a larger global pattern of capitalist expansion and competition.
10. **Africa’s Role in World History**: Du Bois emphasizes the importance of recognizing Africa’s central role in world history. He argues that the exploitation of Africa has shaped not only European development but also global economic and political dynamics, yet this contribution has often been overlooked.
11. **Solidarity Against Imperialism**: Du Bois calls for solidarity among oppressed peoples, particularly Africans and African Americans, to resist imperialism and fight for equality. He argues that liberation from colonial domination requires a united effort to challenge the global capitalist system that perpetuates inequality and conflict.
12. **Conclusion**: Du Bois concludes by stressing the long-term consequences of imperialism in Africa, not only for the continent but for the entire world. He highlights the need for a more just and equitable international order, one that recognizes the rights and humanity of all peoples.

This breakdown of each paragraph reflects Du Bois's argument that the exploitation of Africa was deeply connected to the causes of World War I and to broader patterns of global capitalism, imperialism, and racial inequality. Vitalis, R. *White world order, black power politics: the birth of American international relations* (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2015 [ISBN 9780801456695]. Read ‘Introduction: A Mongrel American Social Science’, pp.1–24.

In the introduction, titled *""A Mongrel American Social Science""*, Robert Vitalis critiques the standard narrative of the development of International Relations (IR) as an academic discipline in the United States. He argues that IR has long been portrayed as a neutral and scientific field, emerging in the aftermath of World War I to address issues of global governance and peace. However, Vitalis challenges this view by exposing the racialized foundations of IR and how it was shaped by ideas of white supremacy and imperialism.

Vitalis introduces the concept of a ""white world order,"" suggesting that early American IR scholars were deeply influenced by racial hierarchies and the need to justify the global dominance of white, Western nations. He traces the origins of the field to the early 20th century, when scholars at elite institutions crafted theories that reflected and reinforced the racial and imperial realities of the time. These scholars were not only interested in managing international politics but also in preserving the dominance of the ""white race"" on the global stage.

Moreover, Vitalis emphasizes how the history of African American intellectuals and their contributions to international thought have been largely erased from the history of IR. Figures such as W.E.B. Du Bois, who critiqued imperialism and advocated for the rights of colonized peoples, are often overlooked in the mainstream narrative of IR’s development. Vitalis points out that these scholars offered a powerful counter-narrative to the racial and imperial assumptions of the field.

The introduction sets the stage for the broader argument of the book, which is to reconsider the history of IR by acknowledging its imperial and racial foundations and to recognize the contributions of Black scholars who challenged these assumptions. Vitalis calls for a rethinking of IR’s origins and a more inclusive understanding of the discipline that accounts for the marginalized voices that have shaped its development.

In essence, this text provides a critical examination of how race and imperialism were central to the early development of IR in the United States, challenging the notion that the field has always been an objective and neutral science.

1. **Opening Argument**: Vitalis begins by questioning the mainstream narrative that presents International Relations (IR) as a neutral, scientific discipline that emerged in the U.S. after World War I to address global peace and governance. He signals his intention to challenge this narrative by exposing the racial and imperialist roots of the field.
2. **The Concept of a ""White World Order""**: Vitalis introduces the idea of a ""white world order,"" arguing that the discipline of IR was built on assumptions about racial hierarchies. Early American IR scholars, he suggests, were concerned not just with managing international politics but also with maintaining white dominance on a global scale.
3. **The Imperial Origins of IR**: The paragraph delves into how the origins of IR are intertwined with the U.S. imperial project, particularly in relation to colonies and non-white peoples. Vitalis explains that IR theories from the early 20th century were shaped by the desire to legitimize and manage imperial rule, presenting imperialism as a natural order.
4. **The Role of Early American Scholars**: Vitalis discusses how American scholars at prestigious universities developed IR as a discipline to reflect U.S. national interests, which were closely tied to maintaining global racial hierarchies and imperial power. These scholars helped shape the field in ways that supported racial and imperial dominance.
5. **Erasing Black Contributions**: The paragraph focuses on how the contributions of African American intellectuals, like W.E.B. Du Bois, have been erased from the history of IR. Vitalis points out that these scholars offered important critiques of imperialism and white supremacy, but their ideas have been largely ignored in mainstream IR scholarship.
6. **Du Bois and His Counter-Narrative**: Vitalis highlights Du Bois’s role in challenging the imperialist and racial assumptions of the early 20th century. Du Bois, and other Black scholars, provided an alternative vision of global politics that emphasized the rights of colonized and oppressed peoples, a perspective that was systematically marginalized.
7. **Mainstream IR and its Racial Bias**: Vitalis argues that the mainstream development of IR intentionally marginalized discussions of race and imperialism, instead presenting the discipline as neutral. He critiques this portrayal, showing how the field has long been complicit in sustaining racial hierarchies and imperialist practices.
8. **Institutionalization of IR**: This paragraph explores how IR became institutionalized as an academic discipline, with its methods and focus areas reflecting the priorities of elite, predominantly white, scholars. Vitalis emphasizes that the early development of IR served the interests of U.S. foreign policy and white supremacy.
9. **Challenging the Dominant Narrative**: Vitalis argues that to understand the true origins of IR, scholars must go beyond the conventional accounts that emphasize the field’s supposed scientific objectivity. Instead, they must recognize the ways in which race and empire shaped its foundational ideas.
10. **The Impact of Black Intellectuals**: Here, Vitalis elaborates on the contributions of Black intellectuals, who provided crucial critiques of imperialism and racism. These voices, however, were marginalized within the emerging field of IR, as their ideas challenged the dominant racial and imperial frameworks.
11. **Historical Amnesia in IR**: Vitalis points out the historical amnesia in IR, where the discipline has forgotten or ignored the imperialist and racist underpinnings of its development. He argues that this forgetting has allowed IR to present itself as a neutral science, free from bias.
12. **Reclaiming the History of IR**: In this paragraph, Vitalis calls for a reclamation of IR’s history, urging scholars to acknowledge the contributions of African American and other marginalized intellectuals. This would provide a fuller and more accurate understanding of the discipline’s origins.
13. **Conclusion**: Vitalis closes by summarizing his argument that the development of IR in the U.S. cannot be understood without recognizing the racial and imperialist foundations of the field. He emphasizes the need for a more inclusive and critical approach to IR, one that acknowledges the voices and perspectives that have been excluded from mainstream narratives.

This summary breaks down how Vitalis critiques the mainstream history of IR, emphasizing the need to reconsider its origins by focusing on race, imperialism, and the contributions of marginalized scholars.

2 critical questions about the article: (SEMINAR)

1. did the early IR scholars INTENTIONALLY exclude black scholars, or was it a consequence of how the world was at the time?
2. The author assumes that US is ‘the centre of the world’ and assumes that only US has this problem
    1. However a central problem before was how IR is very US-centric and he just reinforces that (by putting US in the centre again and saying that US has the problem of imperialism inherent in IR and US should fix it)"

"Summarize the following document in bullet points. Do not include any information that is not in the original text. I need a detailed summary. T h e distant origins of the present volume lie in an article entitled
""Th e End of History?"" which I wrote for the journa l The National
Interest in the summe r of 1989. 1
 In it, I argue d that a remarkabl e
consensus concerning the legitimacy of liberal democracy as a
system of governmen t ha d emerge d throughou t the world over
the past few years, as it conquered rival ideologies like hereditary
monarchy, fascism, an d most recently communism. Mor e than
that, however, I argued that liberal democracy may constitute the
""end point of mankind's ideological evolution"" an d the ""final form
of huma n government, "" an d as such constituted the ""end of history."" Tha t is, while earlier forms of governmen t were characterized by grave defects an d irrationalities that led to their eventual
collapse, liberal democracy was arguably free from such fundamental internal contradictions. This was not to say that today's
stable democracies, like the United States, France, or Switzerland,
were not without injustice or serious social problems. But these
problems were ones of incomplete implementation of the twin
principles of liberty an d equality on which moder n democracy is
founded, rathe r than of flaws in the principles themselves. While
some present-day countries might fail to achieve stable liberal
democracy, an d others might lapse back into other, mor e primitive forms of rule like theocracy or military dictatorship, the ideal
of liberal democracy could not be improved on.
T h e original article excited an extraordinary amoun t of commentary an d controversy, first in the United States, an d then in a
series of countries as different as England, France, Italy, the Soviet Union, Brazil, South Africa, Japan , an d South Korea. Criticism took every conceivable form, some of it based o n simple
misunderstanding of my original intent, an d others penetrating
mor e perceptively to the core of my argument. 2
 Many people
were confused in the first instance by my use of the word ""history."" Understanding history in a conventional sense as the occurrence of events, people pointed to the fall of the Berlin Wall,
xi
xii BY WAY OF AN INTRODUCTION
the Chinese communist crackdown in Tiananme n Square, and
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait as evidence that ""history was continuing, "" an d that I was ipso facto proven wrong.
A n d yet what I suggested ha d come to an end was not the
occurrenc e of events, even large an d grave events, but History:
that is, history understood as a single, coherent, evolutionary process, when taking into account the experience of all peoples in all
times. This understandin g of History was most closely associated
with the great Germa n philosophe r G. W. F. Hegel. It was mad e
part of ou r daily intellectual atmospher e by Karl Marx, who borrowed this concept of History from Hegel, and is implicit in our
use of words like ""primitive"" or ""advanced,"" ""traditional"" or
""modern, "" when referring to different types of huma n societies.
For both of these thinkers, ther e was a coherent development of
huma n societies from simple tribal ones based on slavery and
subsistence agriculture, throug h various theocracies, monarchies,
a n d feudal aristocracies, u p throug h moder n liberal democracy
a n d technologically driven capitalism. This evolutionary process
was neithe r random no r unintelligible, even if it did not proceed
in a straight line, an d even if it was possible to question whether
m a n was happie r or better off as a result of historical ""progress.""
Both Hegel an d Marx believed that the evolution of huma n
societies was not open-ended, but would end when mankind had
achieved a form of society that satisfied its deepest and most fundamenta l longings. Both thinkers thus posited an ""end of history"": for Hegel this was the liberal state, while for Marx it was a
communist society. This did not mea n that the natural cycle of
birth, life, an d death would end, that important events would no
longer happen , or that newspapers reporting them would cease to
be published. It meant, rather, that ther e would be no further
progress in the development of underlying principles and institutions, because all of the really big questions had been settled.
T h e present book is not a restatement of my original article,
n o r is it an effort to continue the discussion with that article's
many critics and commentators. Least of all is it an account of the
e n d of the Cold War, or any othe r pressing topic in contemporary
politics. While this book is informed by recent world events, its
subject returns to a very old question: Whether, at the end of the
twentieth century, it makes sense for us once again to speak of a
coherent an d directional History of mankind that will eventually
lead the greate r part of humanity to liberal democracy? Th e an-
BY WAY OF AN INTRODUCTION xiii
swer I arrive at is yes, for two separate reasons. On e has to do with
economics, and the othe r has to do with what is terme d the ""struggle for recognition.""
It is of course not sufficient to appeal to the authority of He ­
gel, Marx, or any of their contemporary followers to establish the
validity of a directional History. In the century an d a half since
they wrote, their intellectual legacy has been relentlessly assaulted
from all directions. Th e most profound thinkers of the twentieth
century have directly attacked the idea that history is a coherent
or intelligible process; indeed, they have denied the possibility
that any aspect of huma n life is philosophically intelligible. We in
the West have become thoroughly pessimistic with regard to the
possibility of overall progress in democratic institutions. This profound pessimism is not accidental, but bor n of the truly terrible
political events of the first half of the twentieth century—two
destructive world wars, the rise of totalitarian ideologies, an d the
turning of science against ma n in the form of nuclear weapons
and environmental damage . Th e life experiences of the victims of
this past century's political violence—from the survivors of Hitlerism and Stalinism to the victims of Pol Pot—would deny that
there has been such a thing as historical progress. Indeed , we
have become so accustomed by now to expect that the future will
contain bad news with respect to the health an d security of decent,
liberal, democratic political practices that we have problems recognizing good news when it comes.
And yet, good news has come. Th e most remarkabl e development of the last quarte r of the twentieth century has been the
revelation of enormou s weaknesses at the core of the world's
seemingly strong dictatorships, whethe r they be of the militaryauthoritarian Right, or the communist-totalitarian Left. From
Latin America to Eastern Europe , from the Soviet Union to the
Middle East an d Asia, strong governments have been failing over
the last two decades. An d while they have not given way in all
cases to stable liberal democracies, liberal democracy remains the
only coherent political aspiration that spans different regions an d
cultures aroun d the globe. In addition, liberal principles in
economics—the ""free market""—have spread, an d have succeeded
in producing unprecedente d levels of material prosperity, both in
industrially developed countries an d in countries that ha d been,
at the close of World Wa r II, part of the impoverished Thir d
World. A liberal revolution in economic thinking has sometimes
xiv BY WAY OF AN INTRODUCTION
preceded, sometimes followed, the move toward political freedom
aroun d the globe.
All of these developments, so muc h at odds with the terrible
history of the first half of the century when totalitarian governments of the Right an d Left were on the march, suggest the need
to look again at the question of whethe r ther e is some deepe r
connecting thread underlying them, or whethe r they are merely
accidental instances of good luck. By raising once again the question of whethe r ther e is such a thing as a Universal History of
mankind, I am resuming a discussion that was begun in the early
nineteenth century, but mor e or less abandone d in our time because of the enormity of events that mankind has experienced
since then. While drawing on the ideas of philosophers like Kant
a n d Hegel who have addressed this question before, I hop e that
the arguments presented her e will stand on their own."
"please compare Allison and crasher please: - Allison, G. T., & Halperin, M. H. (1972). Bureaucratic politics: A paradigm and some policy implications. *World politics*, *24*(S1), 40-79.
    
    **Overview:**
    
    - Allison and Halperin challenge the traditional notion of the state as a monolithic, rational actor in foreign policy decision-making.
    - introduce the Bureaucratic Politics Model
    - foreign policy outcomes result from complex interactions among various governmental actors, each with distinct interests and objectives.
    
    **Key Concepts:**
    
    1. **Policy as Political Outcome:**
        - Foreign policy decisions emerge from negotiations, compromises, and power struggles among multiple actors within the government.
        - These actors include individuals and organizations, each pursuing their own goals, leading to decisions that are often political resultants rather than strategic choices.
    2. **Players in the Game:**
        - **Chiefs:** High-ranking officials such as the President, cabinet members, and agency heads.
        - **Indians:** Subordinate officials and staff members who provide support and carry out directives.
        - **Ad Hoc Players:** Individuals or groups brought in for specific issues or crises.
    3. **Parochial Priorities and Perceptions:**
        - Each actor's stance is influenced by their organisational role, personal experiences, and institutional interests.
        - This leads to varying perceptions of issues and preferred solutions, often resulting in conflicts and bargaining.
    4. **Action Channels:**
        - Established pathways determine which players are involved in decision-making processes and how information flows.
        - These channels shape the dynamics of the bargaining process and influence outcomes.
    5. **Decision Rules:**
        - Formal and informal procedures guide how decisions are made within the government.
        - These rules can empower or constrain certain actors, affecting their ability to influence policy.
    
    **Mechanisms of Bureaucratic Politics:**
    
    - **Bargaining:** Actors negotiate to align policies with their interests, often leading to compromises.
    - **Coalition Building:** Forming alliances to strengthen one's position and influence outcomes.
    - **Logrolling:** Exchanging support on different issues to achieve desired objectives.
    - **Foot-Dragging:** Delaying or obstructing policies that are unfavorable to an actor's interests.
    
    **Implications for Foreign Policy Analysis:**
    
    - Recognizing that foreign policy is not the product of a singular rational actor but the outcome of multiple competing interests.
    - Understanding the importance of internal governmental dynamics in shaping policy decisions.
    - Highlighting the need to consider the roles of individual actors, organizational interests, and procedural mechanisms in analyses.
    
    **Critiques and Limitations:**
    
    - The model may overemphasize internal politics, potentially underestimating external factors and systemic constraints.
    - It can be challenging to apply empirically due to the complexity and opacity of internal governmental processes.
    - Some argue that it diminishes the role of strategic considerations and the influence of the executive leadership.
    
    **Conclusion:**
    
    - Allison and Halperin's Bureaucratic Politics Model provides a nuanced framework for understanding foreign policy as the result of intricate governmental interactions.
    - It underscores the significance of internal dynamics, individual actors, and organizational interests in shaping policy outcomes.
    - While it offers valuable insights, analysts should balance this perspective with considerations of external factors and overarching strategic objectives.
- Krasner, S. D. (1972). Are bureaucracies important?(or Allison Wonderland). *Foreign Policy*, (7), 159-179.
    - Krasner critically examines the Bureaucratic Politics Model, particularly as articulated by Graham Allison, questioning its explanatory power in foreign policy analysis.
    
    **Key Arguments:**
    
    1. **Critique of the Bureaucratic Politics Model:**
        - Krasner argues that the model overemphasizes internal governmental conflicts and underestimates the influence of central decision-makers, especially the President.
        - He contends that attributing policy outcomes primarily to bureaucratic infighting can obscure the strategic objectives and directives set by top leadership.
    2. **Presidential Authority:**
        - The article emphasizes the significant role of the President in shaping foreign policy, suggesting that ultimate decisions often reflect presidential priorities rather than bureaucratic compromises.
        - Krasner posits that the President possesses the authority to override bureaucratic resistance, thereby centralizing decision-making power.
    3. **Case Study Analysis:**
        - Krasner re-examines the Cuban Missile Crisis, a key example used by Allison, to illustrate his points.
        - He argues that the resolution of the crisis was more a result of presidential leadership and less about bureaucratic maneuvering.
    4. **Analytical Concerns:**
        - The article raises concerns about the methodological challenges in applying the Bureaucratic Politics Model, such as difficulties in empirically validating the extent of bureaucratic influence.
        - Krasner warns that overreliance on this model may lead to analytical distortions, diverting attention from the strategic calculations of top leaders.
    
    **Implications for Foreign Policy Analysis:**
    
    - Krasner's critique suggests a need to balance considerations of bureaucratic dynamics with an understanding of the central role of executive leadership in foreign policy formulation.
    - He advocates for a more nuanced approach that recognizes the interplay between organizational processes and the directives of top policymakers.
    
    **Conclusion:**
    
    - While acknowledging that bureaucratic factors can influence policy implementation, Krasner emphasizes that the primary determinants of foreign policy decisions often reside at the highest levels of government authority.
    - His analysis calls for a reassessment of models that may underplay the decisive role of central leadership in international relations."

"Summarize the following texts in bullet points. Highlight the main argument. Do not include any information that is not in the original text. I need a detailed summary. The Trials and Tribulations
of National Consciousness
History teaches us that the anticolonialist struggle is not
automatically written from a nationalist perspective. Over a
long period of time the colonized have devoted their energy
to eliminating iniquities such as forced labor, corporal
punishment, unequal wages, and the restriction of political
rights. This fight for democracy against man’s oppression
gradually emerges from a universalist, neoliberal confusion
to arrive, sometimes laboriously, at a demand for
nationhood. But the unpreparedness of the elite, the lack of
practical ties between them and the masses, their apathy
and, yes, their cowardice at the crucial moment in the
struggle, are the cause of tragic trials and tribulations.
Instead of being the coordinated crystallization of the
people’s innermost aspirations, instead of being the most
tangible, immediate product of popular mobilization,
national consciousness is nothing but a crude, empty, fragile
shell. The cracks in it explain how easy it is for young
independent countries to switch back from nation to ethnic
group and from state to tribe—a regression which is so
terribly detrimental and prejudicial to the development of
the nation and national unity. As we shall see, such
shortcomings and dangers derive historically from the
incapacity of the national bourgeoisie in underdeveloped
countries to rationalize popular praxis, in other words their
incapacity to attribute it any reason.
The characteristic, virtually endemic weakness of the
underdeveloped countries’ national consciousness is not
only the consequence of the colonized subject’s mutilation
by the colonial regime. It can also be attributed to the
apathy of the national bourgeoisie, its mediocrity, and its
deeply cosmopolitan mentality.
The national bourgeoisie, which takes over power at the
end of the colonial regime, is an underdeveloped
bourgeoisie. Its economic clout is practically zero, and in any
case, no way commensurate with that of its metropolitan
counterpart which it intends replacing. In its willful
narcissism, the national bourgeoisie has lulled itself into
thinking that it can supplant the metropolitan bourgeoisie to
its own advantage. But independence, which literally forces
it back against the wall, triggers catastrophic reactions and
obliges it to send out distress signals in the direction of the
former metropolis. The business elite and university
graduates, who make up the most educated category of the
new nation, are identifiable by their small numbers, their
concentration in the capital, and their occupations as
traders, landowners and professionals. This national
bourgeoisie possesses neither industrialists nor financiers.
The national bourgeoisie in the underdeveloped countries is
not geared to production, invention, creation, or work. All its
energy is channeled into intermediary activities. Networking
and scheming seem to be its underlying vocation. The
national bourgeoisie has the psychology of a businessman,
not that of a captain of industry. And it should go without
saying that the rapacity of the colonists and the embargo
system installed by colonialism hardly left it any choice.
Under the colonial system a bourgeoisie that accumulates
capital is in the realm of the impossible. To our thinking,
therefore, the historical vocation of an authentic national
bourgeoisie in an underdeveloped country is to repudiate its
status as bourgeois and an instrument of capital and to
become entirely subservient to the revolutionary capital
which the people represent.
In an underdeveloped country, the imperative duty of an
authentic national bourgeoisie is to betray the vocation to
which it is destined, to learn from the people, and make
available to them the intellectual and technical capital it
culled from its time in colonial universities. We will see,
unfortunately, that the national bourgeoisie often turns
away from this heroic and positive path, which is both
productive and just, and unabashedly opts for the
antinational, and therefore abhorrent, path of a conventional
bourgeoisie, a bourgeois bourgeoisie that is dismally,
inanely, and cynically bourgeois.
We have seen that the objective of the nationalist parties
from a certain period onward is geared strictly along
national lines. They mobilize the people with the slogan of
independence, and anything else is left to the future. When
these parties are questioned on their economic agenda for
the nation or the regime they propose to establish they
prove incapable of giving an answer because, in fact, they
do not have a clue about the economy of their own country.
This economy has always developed outside their control.
As for the present and potential resources of their country’s
soil and subsoil, their knowledge is purely academic and
approximate. They can only talk about them in general and
abstract terms. After independence, this underdeveloped
bourgeoisie, reduced in number, lacking capital and
rejecting the road to revolution, stagnates miserably. It
cannot give free expression to its genius that was in the past
hampered by colonial domination, or so it claims. The
precariousness of its resources and the scarcity of
managerial talent force it for years into an economy of
cottage industries. In its inevitably highly limited
perspective, the bourgeoisie’s idea of a national economy is
one based on what we can call local products. Grandiloquent
speeches are made about local crafts. Unable to establish
factories which would be more profitable for the country and
for themselves, the bourgeoisie cloaks local artisanship in a
chauvinistic tenderness which not only ties in with the new
national dignity, but also ensures them substantial profits.
This cult for local products, this incapacity to invent new
outlets is likewise reflected in the entrenchment of the
national bourgeoisie in the type of agricultural production
typical of the colonial period.
Independence does not bring a change of direction. The
same old groundnut harvest, cocoa harvest, and olive
harvest. Likewise the traffic of commodities goes
unchanged. No industry is established in the country. We
continue to ship raw materials, we continue to grow produce
for Europe and pass for specialists of unfinished products.
Yet the national bourgeoisie never stops calling for the
nationalization of the economy and the commercial sector.
In its thinking, to nationalize does not mean placing the
entire economy at the service of the nation or satisfying all
its requirements. To nationalize does not mean organizing
the state on the basis of a new program of social relations.
For the bourgeoisie, nationalization signifies very precisely
the transfer into indigenous hands of privileges inherited
from the colonial period.
Since the bourgeoisie has neither the material means nor
adequate intellectual resources such as engineers and
technicians, it limits its claims to the takeover of businesses
and firms previously held by the colonists. The national
bourgeoisie replaces the former European settlers as
doctors, lawyers, tradesmen, agents, dealers, and shipping
agents. For the dignity of the country and to safeguard its
own interests, it considers it its duty to occupy all these
positions. Henceforth it demands that every major foreign
company must operate through them, if it wants to remain
in the country or establish trade. The national bourgeoisie
discovers its historical mission as intermediary. As we have
seen, its vocation is not to transform the nation but
prosaically serve as a conveyor belt for capitalism, forced to
camouflage itself behind the mask of neocolonialism. The
national bourgeoisie, with no misgivings and with great
pride, revels in the role of agent in its dealings with the
Western bourgeoisie. This lucrative role, this function as
small-time racketeer, this narrow-mindedness and lack of
ambition are symptomatic of the incapacity of the national
bourgeoisie to fulfil its historic role as bourgeoisie. The
dynamic, pioneering aspect, the inventive, discoverer-ofnew-worlds aspect common to every national bourgeoisie is
here lamentably absent. At the core of the national
bourgeoisie of the colonial countries a hedonistic mentality
prevails—because on a psychological level it identifies with
the Western bourgeoisie from which it has slurped every
lesson. It mimics the Western bourgeoisie in its negative and
decadent aspects without having accomplished the initial
phases of exploration and invention that are the assets of
this Western bourgeoisie whatever the circumstances. In its
early days the national bourgeoisie of the colonial countries
identifies with the last stages of the Western bourgeoisie.
Don’t believe it is taking short cuts. In fact it starts at the
end. It is already senile, having experienced neither the
exuberance nor the brazen determination of youth and
adolescence.
In its decadent aspect the national bourgeoisie gets
considerable help from the Western bourgeoisies who
happen to be tourists enamored of exoticism, hunting and
casinos. The national bourgeoisie establishes holiday resorts
and playgrounds for entertaining the Western bourgeoisie.
This sector goes by the name of tourism and becomes a
national industry for this very purpose. We only have to look
at what has happened in Latin America if we want proof of
the way the ex-colonized bourgeoisie can be transformed
into “party” organizer. The casinos in Havana and Mexico
City, the beaches of Rio, Copacabana, and Acapulco, the
young Brazilian and Mexican girls, the thirteen-year-old
mestizas, are the scars of this deprivation of the national
bourgeoisie. Because it is lacking in ideas, because it is
inward-looking, cut off from the people, sapped by its
congenital incapacity to evaluate issues on the basis of the
nation as a whole, the national bourgeoisie assumes the role
of manager for the companies of the West and turns its
country virtually into a bordello for Europe.
Once again we need only to look at the pitiful spectacle of
certain republics in Latin America. U.S. businessmen,
banking magnates and technocrats jet “down to the
tropics,” and for a week to ten days wallow in the sweet
depravity of their private “reserves.”
The behavior of the national landowners is practically the
same as that of the urban bourgeoisie. As soon as
independence is proclaimed the big farmers demand the
nationalization of the agricultural holdings. Through a
number of schemes they manage to lay hands on the farms
once owned by the colonists, thereby reinforcing their
control over the region. But they make no attempt to
diversify, increase production or integrate it in a genuinely
national economy.
In fact the landowners call on the authorities to increase a
hundredfold the facilities and privileges now theirs but once
reserved for the foreign colonists. The exploitation of farm
workers is intensified and justified. Capitalizing on two or
three slogans, these new colonists demand a colossal effort
from these farm laborers— in the name of the national
interest, of course. There is no modernization of agriculture,
no development plan, no initiative, for initiatives imply a
degree of risk, and would throw such milieus into a panic,
and put to flight a wary, overcautious, landed bourgeoisie
which is sinking deeper and deeper into the ruts established
by colonialism. In such regions, initiatives are handled by
the government. It is the government which approves them,
encourages them and finances them. The landed
bourgeoisie refuses to take the slightest risk. It is hostile to
gambling and ventures. It has no intention of building upon
sand. It demands solid investments and quick returns. The
profits it pockets are enormous compared to the gross
national product, and are not reinvested. Its only mentality
is to hoard its savings. This bourgeoisie especially in the
aftermath of independence, has no scruples depositing in
foreign banks the profits it has made from the national
resources. Major sums, however, are invested for the sake of
prestige in cars, villas, and all those ostentatious goods
described by economists as typical of an underdeveloped
bourgeoisie.
We have said that the colonized bourgeoisie which attains
power utilizes the aggressiveness of its class to grab the jobs
previously held by foreigners. In the aftermath of
independence, faced with the human consequences of
colonialism, it wages a ruthless struggle against the lawyers,
tradespeople, landowners, doctors, and high-ranking civil
servants “who insult the national dignity.” It frantically
brandishes the notions of nationalization and Africanization
of the managerial classes. In fact, its actions become
increasingly tinged with racism. It bluntly confronts the
government with the demand that it must have these jobs.
And it does not tone down its virulence until it occupies
every single one of them.
The urban proletariat, the unemployed masses, the small
artisans, those commonly called small traders, side with this
nationalist attitude; but, in all justice, they are merely
modeling their attitude on that of their bourgeoisie. Whereas
the national bourgeoisie competes with the Europeans, the
artisans and small traders pick fights with Africans of other
nationalities. In the Ivory Coast, outright race riots were
directed against the Dahomeans* and Upper Voltans who
controlled much of the business sector and were the target
of hostile demonstrations by the Ivorians following
independence. We have switched from nationalism to
ultranationalism, chauvinism, and racism. There is a general
call for these foreigners to leave, their shops are burned,
their market booths torn down and some are lynched;
consequently, the Ivorian government orders them to leave,
thereby satisfying the demands of the nationals. In Senegal
it was the anti-Sudanese** demonstrations that caused
Mamadou Dia to state: “The people of Senegal owe their
blind belief in the Federation of Mali to their affection for its
leaders. Their deep attachment to Mali has no other basis
but a repeated act of faith in the politics of these leaders.
The issue of Senegalese territory was no less alive in their
minds, especially as the Sudanese presence in Dakar was far
too visible for the problem to be overlooked. This is the
reason why, far from causing any regrets, the breakup of the
Federation was greeted by the masses with relief and there
was no support from any quarter in its favor.”
13
Whereas certain categories of Senegalese jump at the
opportunity offered by their own leaders to get rid of the
Sudanese, who are unwelcome elements in the business and
administrative sectors, the Congolese, who watched in
disbelief as the Belgians left en masse, decide to put
pressure on the Senegalese established at Léopoldville and
Elizabethville and in turn get them to leave.
As we can see, the mechanism is identical in both cases.
Whereas the ambitions of the young nation’s intellectuals
and business bourgeoisie are thwarted by the Europeans, for
the majority of the urban population, competition stems
mainly from Africans of other nations. In the Ivory Coast it is
the Dahomeans; in Ghana, the inhabitants of Niger; and in
Senegal, the Sudanese.
Whereas the demand for Africanization and Arabization of
management by the bourgeoisie is not rooted in a genuine
endeavor at nationalization, but merely corresponds to a
transfer of power previously held by the foreigners, the
masses make the very same demand at their own level but
limit the notion of African or Arab to territorial limits.
Between the vibrant calls for African unity and this mass
behavior inspired by the managerial class, a number of
attitudes emerge. There is a constant pendulum motion
between African unity, which sinks deeper and deeper into
oblivion, and a depressing return to the most heinous and
virulent type of chauvinism.
“As for the Senegalese leaders who were the main
theoreticians of African unification and who, on several
occasions, sacrificed their local political organizations as
well as their personal careers to this idea, they undeniably
bear a great deal of responsibility, although admittedly in all
good faith. Their mistake, our mistake, under the pretext of
combating Balkanization, was not to take into consideration
that pre-colonial factor of territoriality. Our mistake was not
to give enough attention in our analyses to this factor,
exacerbated by colonialism, but also a sociological fact
which no theory on unity, however commendable or
appealing, can eliminate. We let ourselves be tempted by
the mirage whose configuration is the most satisfying for the
mind, and taking our ideal for reality, we believed we only
needed to condemn territoriality and its natural offshoot,
micro nationalism, to get the better of them and ensure the
success of our chimerical endeavor.”
14
From Senegalese chauvinism to Wolof tribalism, there is
but one small step. And consequently, wherever the pettymindedness of the national bourgeoisie and the haziness of
its ideological positions have been incapable of enlightening
the people as a whole or have been unable to put the people
first, wherever this national bourgeoisie has proven to be
incapable of expanding its vision of the world, there is a
return to tribalism, and we watch with a raging heart as
ethnic tensions triumph. Since the only slogan of the
bourgeoisie is “Replace the foreigners,” and they rush into
every sector to take the law into their own hands and fill the
vacancies, the petty traders such as taxi drivers, cake
sellers, and shoe shiners follow suit and call for the
expulsion of the Dahomeans or, taking tribalism to a new
level, demand that the Fulani go back to their bush or back
up their mountains."

was ""in a bit of a hurry"" because she was ""preparing another lecture

of those lectures. The entire series originally bore a subtitle, ""The
Problem of Action and Thought after the French Revolution."" That
subtitle has not been used here, as it is misleading without the first two
parts of the lectures. The manuscript exists in two versions, one of which
was heavily revised by Arendt. The later, revised version is published
here for the first time. A brief selection from the earlier version was
published in French in Cahiers du Grif in 1986.

1 HE GULF between philosophy and politics opened histori-
cally with the trial and condemnation of Socrates, which in the

history of political thought plays the same role of a turning
point that the trial and condemnation of Jesus plays in the
history of religion. Our tradition of political thought began
when the death of Socrates made Plato despair of polis life
and, at the same time, doubt certain fundamentals of Socrates'
teachings. The fact that Socrates had not been able to persuade
his judges of his innocence and his merits, which were so
obvious to the better and younger of Athens's citizens, made
Plato doubt the validity of persuasion. We have difficulty in
grasping the importance of this doubt, because ""persuasion"" is
a very weak and inadequate translation of the ancient peithein,
the political importance of which is indicated by the fact that
Peitho, the goddess of persuasion, had a temple in Athens. To
persuade, peithein, was the specifically political form of speech.

and since the Athenians were proud that they, in distinction to
the barbarians, conducted their political affairs in the form of
speech and without compulsion, they cbnsidered rhetoric, the
art of persuasion, the highest, the truly political art. Socrates'
speech in the Apology is one of its great examples, and it is
against this defense that Plato writes ih the Phaedo a ""revised
apology"" which he called, with iroijiy, ""more persuasive""
{pithanoteron, 63B), since it ends with a imyth of the Hereafter,
complete with bodily punishments and rewards, calculated to
frighten rather than meriely persuade |the audience. Socrates'
point in his defense before the citizens and judges of Athens
had been that his behavior was in the best interest of the city.
In the Crito he had explained to his friends that he could not
flee but rather, for political reasons, ^must suffer the death
penalty. It seems that he was not only lunable to persuade his
judges but also could not convince his friends. In other words,
the city had no use for a philosopher, and the friends had no
use for political argumentation. This is part of the tragedy to
which Plato's dialogues testify. j
Closely connected with his doubt about the validity of
persuasion is Plato's furious denunciation of doxa, opinion,
which not only ran like a red thread through his political works
but became one of the cornerstones cif his concept of truth.
Platonic truth, even when doxa is not mentioned, is always
understood as the very opposite of opinion. The spectacle of
Socrates submitting his own doxa to th6 irresponsible opinions
of the Athenians, and being outvoted by a majority, made
Plato despise opinions and yearn for absolute standards. Such
standards, by which human deeds could be judged and human
thought could achieve some measure {j)f reliability, from then
on became the primary impulse of his political philosophy, and
influenced decisively even the purely philosophical doctrine of
ideas. I do not think, as is often maintained, that the concept of
ideas was primarily a concept of standards and measures, nor
that its origin was political. But this interpretation is all the
more understandable and justifiable because Plato himself was

PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS 75
the first to use the ideas for political purposes, that is, to
introduce absolute standards into the realm of human affairs,
where, without such transcending standards, everything
remains relative. As Plato himself used to point out, we do not

know what absolute greatness is, but experience only some-
thing greater or smaller in relationship to something else.

Truth and Opinion

The opposition of truth and opinion was certainly the most
anti-Socratic conclusion that Plato drew from Socrates' trial.
Socrates, in failing to convince the city, had shown that the city
is no safe place for the philosopher, not only in the sense that
his life is not safe because of the truth he possesses, but also in
the much more important sense that the city cannot be trusted
with preserving the memory of the philosopher. If the citizens
could condemn Socrates to death, they were only too liable to
forget him when he was dead. His earthly immortality would
be safe only if philosophers could be inspired with a solidarity
of their own which was opposed to the solidarity of the polis
and their fellow citizens. The old argument against the sophoi,
wise men, which recurs in Aristotle as well as in Plato, that they
do not know what is good for themselves (the prerequisite for
political wisdom) and that they look ridiculous when they
appear in the marketplace and are a common laughing
stock—as Thales was laughed at by a peasant girl when, staring
up at the skies, he feel into the well at his feet—was turned by
Plato against the city.
In order to comprehend the enormity of Plato's demand
that the philosopher should become the ruler of the city, we
must keep in mind these common ""prejudices"" which the polis
had with respect to philosophers, but not with respect to artists
and poets. Only the sophos who does not know what is good for
himself will know even less what is good for the polis. The
sophos, the wise man as ruler, must be seen in opposition to the
current ideal of the phronimos, the understanding man whose

76 SOCIAL RESEARCH
insights into the world of human affairs qualify him for
leadership, though of course not to rul6. Philosophy, the love
of wisdom, was not thought to be the same at all as this insight,
phronesis. The wise man alone is concerned with matters
outside the polis, and Aristotle is in full agreement with this
public opinion when he states: ""Anaxagoras and Thales were
wise, but not understanding men. Theyiwere not interested in
what is good for men [anthropina agatha].""^ Plato did not deny
that the concern of the philosopher was with eternal,
nonchanging, nonhuman matters. But he did not agree that
this made him unfit to play a political role. He did not agree
with the polis's conclusion that the philosopher, without
concern for the human good, was himself in constant danger
of becoming a good-for-nothing. The notion of good (agathos)
has no connection here with what we mean by goodness in an
absolute sense; it means exclusively good-for, beneficial or
useful (chresimon) and is therefore unstatjle and accidental since
it is not necessarily what it is but can always be different. The
reproach that philosophy can deprive citizens of their personal
fitness is implicitly contained in Pericles' famous statement:
philokaloumen met' euteleias kai philosophoumen aneu malakias (we
love the beautiful without exaggeration and we love wisdom
without softness or unmanliness).^ In distinction from our own
prejudices, in which softness and unmanliness are rather
connected with the love of the beautiful, the Greeks saw this
danger in philosophy. Philosophy, the concern with truth
regardless of the realm of human affairs—and not love of the
beautiful, which everywhere was represented in the polis, in
statues and poetry, in music and the Olympic games—drove its
adherents out of the polis and made them unfit for it. When
Plato claimed rulership for the philosopher because he alone
could behold the idea of the good, the highest of the eternal
essences, he opposed the polis on two grounds: he first claimed
' Nic. Eth. 1140 a 25-30; 1141b 4-8.
2 Thuc. 2. 40.

PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS 77
that the philosopher's concern with eternal things did not put
him at risk of becoming a good-for-nothing, and, second, he
asserted that these eternal things were even more ""valuable""
than they were beautiful. His reply to Protagoras that not man
but a god is the measure of all human things is only another
version of the same statement. ^
Plato's elevation of the idea of the good to the highest place
in the realm of ideas, the idea of ideas, occurs in the cave
allegory and must be understood in this political context. It is
much less a matter of course than we, who have grown up in
the consequences of the Platonic tradition, are likely to think.
Plato, obviously, was guided by the Greek proverbial ideal, the
kalon k'agathon (the beautiful and good), and it is therefore
significant that he made up his mind for the good instead of
the beautiful. Seen from the point of view of the ideas
themselves, which are defined as that whose appearance
illuminates, the beautiful, which cannot be used but only shines
forth, had much more right to become the idea of ideas.'' The
difference between the good and the beautiful, not only to us
but even more so to the Greeks, is that the good can be applied
and has an element of use in itself. Only if the realm of ideas is
illuminated by the idea of the good could Plato use the ideas
for political purposes and, in the Laws, erect his ideocracy, in
which eternal ideas were translated into human laws.
What appears in the Republic as a strictly philosophical
argument had been prompted by an exclusively political
experience—the trial and death of Socrates—and it was not
Plato but Socrates who was the first philosopher to overstep
the line drawn by the polis for the sophos, for the man who is
concerned with eternal, nonhuman, and nonpolitical things.
The tragedy of Socrates' death rests on a misunderstanding:
what the polis did not understand was that Socrates did not

Chicago Press, 1970), pp. 225-226 and n. 65.—Ed.

claim to be a sophos, a wise man. Because he doubted that
wisdom is for mortals, he saw the irofly in the Delphic oracle
that said he was the wisest of all men: the man who knows that
men cannot be wise is the wisest of them all. The polis did not
believe him, and demanded that he!admit that he, like all
sophoi, was politically a good-for-nothing. But as a philosopher
he truly had nothing to teach his fellow citizens.

The Tyranny of Truth
I

The confiict between the philosopher and the polis had
come to a head because Socrates had made new demands on
philosophy precisely because he did not claim to be wise. And
it is in this situation that Plato designed his tyranny of truth, in
which it is not what is temporally goocl, of which men can be
persuaded, but eternal truth, of yhich men cannot be
persuaded, that is to rule the city. What had become apparent
in the Socratic experience was that only rulership might assure
the philosopher of that earthly immortality which the polis was
supposed to assure all its citizens. For| while the thought and
actions of all men were threatened by their own inherent
instability and human forgetfulness, the thoughts of the
philosopher were exposed to willful oblivion. The same polis,
therefore, which guaranteed its inhabitants an immortality and
stability which they never could hope for without it, was a
threat and a danger to the immortality pf the philosopher. The
philosopher, it is true, in his intercourse with eternal things,
felt the need of earthly immortality less than anybody else. Yet
this eternity, which was more than earthly immortality, came
into conflict with the polis whenever the philosopher tried to
bring his concerns to the attention of his fellow citizens. As
soon as the philosopher submitted hisj truth, the reflection of
the eternal, to the polis, it became immediately an opinion
among opinions. It lost its distinguishing quality, for there is
no visible hallmark which marks off truth from opinion. It is as

PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS 79
though the moment the eternal is brought into the midst of
men it becomes temporal, so that the very discussion of it with
others already threatens the existence of the realm in which
the lovers of wisdom move.
In the process of reasoning out the implications of Socrates'
trial, Plato arrived both at his concept of truth as the very
opposite of opinion and at his notion of a specifically
philosophical form of speech, dialegesthai, as the opposite of
persuasion and rhetoric. Aristotle takes these distinctions and
oppositions as a matter of course when he begins his Rhetoric,
which belongs to his political writings no less than his Ethics,
with the statement: hS rhetorike estin antistrophos te dialektike (the
art of persuasion [and therefore the political art of speech] is
the counterpart of the art of dialectic [the art of philosophical
speech]).5 The chief distinction between persuasion and
dialectic is that the former always addresses a multitude
{peithein ta pUthe) whereas dialectic is possible only as a dialogue
between two. Socrates' mistake was to address hisjudges in the
form of dialectic, which is why he could not persuade them.
His truth, on the other hand, since he respected the limitations
inherent in persuasion, became an opinion among opinions,
not worth a bit more than the nontruths of the judges. Socrates
insisted in talking the matter through with his judges as he
used to talk about all kinds of things with single Athenian
citizens or with his pupils; and he believed that he could arrive
at some truth thereby and persuade the others of it. Yet
persuasion does not come from truth, it comes from opinions,'^
and only persuasion reckons and knows how to deal with the
multitude. To persuade the multitude means to force upon its
multiple opinions one's own opinion; persuasion is not the
opposite of rule by violence, it is only another form of it. The
myths of a Hereafter with which Plato concluded all his
political dialogues, with the exception of the Laws, are neither

Phaedrus 260A.

80 SOCIAL RESEARCH
truth nor mere opinion; they are desigrled as stories which can
frighten, that is, an attempt to use violence by words only. He
can do without a concluding myth in the Laws because the
detailed prescriptions and even morej detailed catalogue of
punishments makes violence with merel words unnecessary.
Although it is more than probable that Socrates was the first
who had used dialegesthai (talking something through with
somebody) systematically, he probably did not look upon this
as the opposite or even the counterpart 'to persuasion, and it is
certain that he did not oppose the results of this dialectic to
doxa, opinion. To Socrates, as to his fellow citizens, doxa was the
formulation in speech of what dokei \moi, that is, of what
appears to me. This doxa had as its topic not what Aristotle
called the eikos, the probable, the ; many verisimilia (as
distinguished from the unum verum, the one truth, on one
hand, and the limitless falsehoods, th| faba infinita, on the
other), but comprehended the world as it opens itself to me. It
was not, therefore, subjective fantasy and arbitrariness, but
also not something absolute and valid f6r all. The assumption
was that the world opens up diffeijently to every man,
according to his position in it; and that the ""sameness"" of the
world, its commonness (koinon, as thp Greeks would say,
common to all) or ""objectivity"" (as we would say from the
subjective viewpoint of modern philosophy) resides in the fact
that the same world opens up to everyone and that despite all
differences between men and their positions in the world—and
consequently their doxai (opinions) —""both you and I are
human."" i
The word doxa means not only opinion but also splendor
and fame. As such, it is related to the political realm, which is
the public sphere in which everybody can appear and show
who he himself is. To assert one's ownl opinion belonged to
being able to show oneself, to be seen and heard by others. To
the Greeks this was the one great privilege attached to public
life and lacking in the privacy of the household, where one is
neither seen nor heard by others. (Tjhe family, wife and

PHILOSOPHY AND POLITICS 81
children, and slaves and servants, were of course not
recognized as fully human.) In private life one is hidden and
can neither appear nor shine, and consequently no doxa is
possible there. Socrates, who refused public office and honor,
never retired into this private life, but on the contrary moved
in the marketplace, in the very midst of these doxai, these
opinions. What Plato later called dialegesthai, Socrates himself
called maieutic, the art of midwifery: he wanted to help others
give birth to what they themselves thought anyhow, to find the
truth in their doxa.
This method had its significance in a twofold conviction:
every man has his own doxa, his own opening to the world, and
Socrates therefore must always begin with questions; he cannot
know beforehand what kind of dokei moi, of it-appears-to-me,
the other possesses. He must make sure of the other's position
in the common world. Yet, just as nobody can know
beforehand the other's doxa,so nobody can know by himself
and without further effort the inherent truth of his own
opinion. Socrates wanted to bring out this truth which
everyone potentially possesses. If we remain true to his own
metaphor of maieutic, we may say: Socrates wanted to make
the city more truthful by delivering each of the citizens of their
truths. The method of doing this is dialegesthai, talking
something through, but this dialectic brings forth truth not by
destroying doxa or opinion, but on the contrary reveals doxa in
its own truthfulness. The role of the philosopher, then, is not
to rule the city but to be its ""gadfly,"" not to tell philosophical
truths but to make citizens more truthful. The difference with
Plato is decisive: Socrates did not want to educate the citizens
so much as he wanted to improve their doxai, which constituted
the political life in which he too took part. To Socrates,
maieutic was a political activity, a give and take, fundamentally
on a basis of strict equality, the fruits of which could not be
measured by the result of arriving at this or that general truth.
It is therefore obviously still quite in the Socratic tradition that
Plato's early dialogues frequently conclude inconclusively.

without a result. To have talked something through, to have
talked about something, some citizen's doxa, seemed result

Published: 22 September 2021
Author: Centre on Constitutional Change
Body text
In this blog post, Ilker Gokhan Sen - visiting researcher at the University of Bergen Faculty of Law and an alumnus of the 2021 Centre on Constitutional Change Summer School - examines the common legal and political issues around sovereignty referendums.

The concept
Sovereignty referendums are popular consultations pertaining to territorial modifications, the independence of states, the self-determination of a decentralised community or adhesion of a state to a supra-national organisation. From a legal point of view, these referendums are matters of both international and constitutional law. From a constitutional point of view, there should first exist a political unit before adopting its constitution. Thus, all sovereignty referendums are inherently constitutional referendums. As regards the international law, sovereignty referendums entail the question of international personality, of a polity: the capacity to be the possessor of rights and duties under international law. Contemporary practice of sovereignty referendums may be categorised into three groups:

Independence, decolonisation (status), and transfer of sovereignty.

Independence referendums

Referendums held for the approval of secession of a territory for the creation of a new state are called independence referendums. Three sub-types may be distinguished.

The first type of referendums concerns the territories that are subject to the international law on decolonisation. East Timor (1999) and the referendum in New Caledonia (2020) may be included in this category. 

The second type of referendums include those that are held to approve a secession of a territory, to which international law does not explicitly bestow that right. The formal-legal basis is then provided by the agreement of the main actors. The referendum held during the accession of Montenegro to independence (2006), the one that led to the independence of South Sudan (2011), and the independence referendum in Scotland (2014) are the most significant examples.

The third type of independence referendums include those unilaterally held by secessionist groups or territories. Examples include the referendums held in Quebec (1980 and 1995) in its attempt to secede from Canada and the Catalan independence referendum of 2017.

Status referendums

The status referendums are held within a decolonisation context when independence is not an option (series of referendums held in the French overseas department of Mayotte), or is highly unlikely politically (Puerto Rico, 2020). In most of these referendums, a set of constitutional arrangements or an international treaty is submitted to the voters, in order to determine the relationship between the territories subject to decolonisation law and their administering states.

Transfer of sovereignty referendums

Transfer of sovereignty referendums may be either supra-national or sub-national. Referendums held in several European countries during the process of EU integration may be seen as major examples. The 2016 Brexit referendum added the “disintegration” aspect to that category. The subject of a sub-national referendum may be the creation of a constitutionally autonomous territory or revision of its constitutional status in a unitary state.

This category comprises the referendums on devolution in the UK.

Common issues
A rich historical data from international law and comparative constitutional law, offer an opportunity for a synthetic framework for a legitimate referendum. This may be summarised as follows.

De jure or de facto 

Ideally, referendums should take place, with valid legal base and/or with formal acceptance of all parties to the sovereignty conflict. The political/constitutional outcome of de facto independence referendums may differ depending on the context. In the Quebec case, Federal Supreme Court of Canada conferred referendums with a significant legal value: Despite having been held unilaterally by the Quebec Government, the Supreme Court of Canada opined that the referendum could have been a legitimate way to demonstrate the wish of the population to secede, and as the initiator of a negotiation process, which could result in secession.

In contrast, Spanish central government’s reaction to the Catalan referendum was not that benign. Constitutional Court of Spain has suspended the relevant referendum law passed by the Catalan parliament. Consequently, a region-wide police operation (Operation Anubis) took place in the run up to the referendum; and the Supreme Court sentenced the separatist leaders, for sedition, from nine to thirteen years of prison.

Qualified majority

When it comes to the sovereignty referendums, a qualified majority as a condition for approval looks like a legitimate measure. Given the importance of such referendums in a given polity, this condition may provide a more inclusive way of decision taking and help to avoid the stark majoritarian nature of the referendum device.

It is thus, a common feature in the constitutions of many democratic states; and quite a steady tendency in international law.

Voter qualification

The decision about entitlement to vote in sovereignty referendums entails two equally legitimate principles, which may, in most cases, be at odds with each other: universal suffrage and right to self-determination. Historical practice and law of sovereignty referendums use two criteria to reconcile conflicting rights and principles: nativity and residence.

In East Timor referendum for example, persons born outside of the territory but having at least one East Timorese parent, were entitled to vote. Yet this was not always the case. In the Brexit referendum, the UK High Court upheld a 15-year limit of absence for the British citizens’ right to vote, who lived abroad. The difference is mostly due to the pre-referendum history. When the political context is stable and peaceful before and during the referendum, it appears that the residency criterion outweighs the ethnic or birth criterion.

Designation of the voting units

The main question here is whether a given polity or territory should be treated as a single entity or be divided into more than one zones.

An illustrative example may be the 2004 Cyprus unification referendum. Here, two simultaneous referendums were held since international law recognised two distinct ethnic groups (Greek and Turkish). Consequently, the relevant international legal sources required a majority of the voters within each community for the referendum to be valid. This approach, however, did not find a support during the Brexit referendum. In that case, “the devolved regions argued that the UK included at least four demoi: those of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as England.”

But this argument did not receive any support from the Westminister.

Formulation of the ballot question

Finally, the ballot question should be formulated to offer voters an informed and coherent choice. Firstly, the wording should be clear and free of ambiguity and should not be deceptive or confusing.Secondly, the universal democratic values also impose that the ballot should observe the rule of unity of content: the voters should not be forced to vote on more than one option disparately included in the same ballot question."

 # WEEK 12: **Modernisation Theory**

- SG CH.4
    
    POINT OF THE CHAPTER: explores theories that try to explain why some countries are democratic while others are not. While no theory is perfect, they help us understand patterns and ask deeper questions.
    
    ---
    
    ### **1. The Purpose of Theorising**
    
    - theories aim to identify patterns in democratisation, but they cannot predict specific events.
    - They improve our understanding of democratisation, even if they don’t provide definitive answers.
    
    ---
    
    ### **2. Main Approaches to Studying Democratisation**
    
    **a) Historical Approaches**
    
    - Focus on specific case studies to identify key moments of democratisation.
    - Strengths: Provide detailed insights and nuanced understanding of individual cases.
    - Limitations: Results may not apply to all cases because political conditions constantly evolve.
    
    **b) Statistical Approaches**
    
    - Use data from many countries to find patterns, such as links between democracy and wealth.
    - Strengths: Identify general trends and probabilities.
    - Limitations: Patterns can change over time (e.g., the rise of African democracies in the late 20th century).
    
    ---
    
    ### **3. Modernisation Theory**
    
    - Economic development → democracy
        - through reduced inequality, better living standards, and middle-class growth
    - **Key factors influencing democracy in modernisation theory:**
        - **Economic Development:** Wealthier societies are typically more stable and democratic.
        - **Literacy:** Enables political engagement but isn’t a perfect predictor (e.g., India’s democracy despite high illiteracy).
        - **Urbanization:** Urban areas foster independence and political activism compared to rural areas.
        - **Diffusion of Power:** Economic growth redistributes power from elites to a broader population, supporting democracy.
    
    ---
    
    ### **4. Criticisms of Modernisation Theory**
    
    **a) Economic Criticisms**
    
    - Some argue poor countries struggle to catch up with wealthy nations (dependency theory).
    - Modernisation theory can be overly optimistic about development leading to democracy.
    
    **b) Social Criticisms**
    
    - Early modernisation depended on large working-class movements, which are less common today.
    - First World development paths cannot always be replicated in today’s globalised world.
    
    **c) International Criticisms**
    
    - Geography and foreign influence can block democratisation (e.g., Soviet dominance in Eastern Europe).
    
    **d) Demographic Criticisms**
    
    - Rapid population growth can create social tensions and political instability (e.g., youth unemployment and radicalisation).
    
    ---
    
    ### **5. Challenges to Democracy**
    
    - Democracies often face breakdowns due to:
        - Social upheaval during rapid change.
        - Economic frustration (e.g., slow growth in poor countries).
        - Discontent among educated groups unable to meet their ambitions.
    
    ---
    
    ### **6. The Value of These Theories**
    
    - Theories do not give definitive answers or predict specific events (e.g., a military coup).
    - They provide useful frameworks to analyse democratisation and make our understanding of political transitions more sophisticated.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Key Takeaways**
    
    - Democracies emerge through a mix of economic, social, historical, and international factors.
    - No single theory can explain democratisation completely.
    - Understanding these theories helps analyse why democracy succeeds or fails in different contexts.
- Grugel, *Democratization: A Critical Introduction*, chapter 3, especially pp. 46-51
    
    THESIS STATEMENT: No single theory can fully explain democratisation; instead, it is a complex process influenced by economic, historical, structural, agency-based, and international factors, each offering valuable but incomplete insights into how and why countries transition to democracy.
    
    ### **Chapter 3: Theories of Democratisation**
    
    POINT OF CHAPTER: examines various theoretical frameworks that scholars use to understand the processes and factors influencing democratisation
    
    ---
    
    ### **1. Modernisation Theory**
    
    - **Core Idea:** Economic development → social changes → democracy
    - **Key Points:**
        - As societies become wealthier, they experience higher education levels, urbanisation, and a growing middle class.
        - These changes create demands for political participation and democratic governance.
    - **Critiques:**
        - Overemphasis on economic factors while neglecting political and cultural influences.
        - Not all economically developed countries become democracies, and some poorer nations have democratised.
    
    ---
    
    ### **2. Historical Sociology Approach**
    
    - **Core Idea:** Historical structures and class relations shape democratisation.
    - **Key Points:**
        - Focuses on how historical events, social classes, and state structures influence democratic transitions.
        - Examines the role of revolutions, wars, and social movements in promoting or hindering democracy.
    - **Critiques:**
        - Overlook role of individual agency and contemporary global influences.
    
    ---
    
    ### **3. Agency/Transition Approach**
    
    - **Core Idea:** Democratization results from deliberate actions by political actors.
    - **Key Points:**
        - Highlights the decisions and strategies of elites, opposition groups, and civil society in negotiating democratic transitions.
        - Emphasises pacts, negotiations, and the role of leadership in shaping outcomes.
    - **Critiques:**
        - overlook structural factors
    
    ---
    
    ### **4. Structural Approach**
    
    - **Core Idea:** Long-term structural factors determine democratization prospects.
    - **Key Points:**
        - Considers elements like economic systems, class structures, and state institutions.
        - Argues that certain structural conditions are more conducive to democracy.
    - **Critiques:**
        - Can be deterministic, underestimating the potential for change through human agency.
    
    ---
    
    ### **5. International Factors**
    
    - **Core Idea:** Global influences play a significant role in democratisation.
    - **Key Points:**
        - Examines how international organisations, foreign governments, and global economic pressures impact democratic transitions.
        - Considers the diffusion of democratic norms and the role of external support or coercion.
    - **Critiques:**
        - May overstate external influence while neglecting domestic dynamics.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Conclusion**
    
    - Understanding democratisation requires a multifaceted approach that considers economic, historical, structural, agency-based, and international perspectives
    - Each theory offers valuable insights but also has limitations
    - A comprehensive analysis should integrate these approaches to fully grasp the complexities of democratic transitions
- Martin S Lipset (1959), Some Social Requisites of Democracy: Economic Development and Political Legitimacy. *The American Political Science Review*, pp.69-105
    
    THESIS: Lipset argues that economic development, through indicators like wealth, industrialization, education, and urbanization, creates social conditions that promote democracy by fostering political legitimacy and stability.
    
    ---
    
    ### **1. Core Argument: Economic Development and Democracy**
    
    - **Economic Development Indicators:**
        - **Wealth:** Reduces class conflict and promotes social stability.
        - **Industrialisation:** Enhances economic productivity and social mobility.
        - **Education:** Encourages informed and engaged citizens.
        - **Urbanisation:** Facilitates political interaction and mobilisation.
    - **Outcome:** These factors collectively enable the growth and sustenance of democratic systems.
    
    ---
    
    ### **2. Political Legitimacy**
    
    - **Definition:** Political legitimacy refers to citizens' acceptance and support for their government and institutions.
    - **Connection to Democracy:** Economic development enhances government performance, which increases public satisfaction and support for democracy.
    - **Result:** Stability and reduced likelihood of authoritarian regression.
    
    ---
    
    ### **3. Social and Cultural Dimensions**
    
    - **Education and Tolerance:** Higher education levels promote open-mindedness, rationality, and civic participation, all of which support democratic norms.
    - **Cultural Influence:** Although Lipset acknowledges the role of cultural factors, he emphasises that economic development can help overcome cultural obstacles to democratisation.
    
    ---
    
    ### **4. Key Factors Supporting Democracy**
    
    a) **Wealth and Income Distribution**
    
    - Wealth reduces inequality, fostering social harmony and reducing class-based tensions that can undermine democracy.
    
    b) **Education**
    
    - An educated electorate is better equipped to evaluate policies, hold leaders accountable, and participate effectively in democratic governance.
    
    c) **Urbanisation**
    
    - Urban areas provide a platform for political interaction and activism, encouraging democratic participation and reducing the dominance of traditional elites.
    
    ---
    
    ### **5. Critiques of Lipset’s Theory**
    
    - **Empirical Challenges:**
        - Some scholars argue that economic development alone does not cause democratisation; it may only sustain existing democracies.
        - Example: Przeworski and Limongi (1997) suggest that authoritarian regimes do not necessarily democratise as they develop economically.
    - **Overemphasis on Economic Factors:**
        - Critics highlight the role of political institutions, leadership decisions, and international influences in shaping democratization, which Lipset downplays.
    
    ---
    
    ### **6. Legacy and Importance**
    
    - **Influence:** Lipset’s work laid the foundation for modernization theory, which links economic progress to democracy.
    - **Enduring Relevance:** While criticized and updated by subsequent research, his emphasis on economic and social conditions remains central to understanding democratization.
    
    ---
    
    ### **Conclusion**
    
    - Lipset’s theory argues that democracy thrives in societies with economic development, which fosters political legitimacy and stability.
    - Although not without its limitations, his framework provides a crucial lens for analyzing the social requisites of democracy and remains a cornerstone in political science and democratization studies.
- Adrian Leftwich (1996), Two Cheers for Democracy?, *Political Quarterly*, 67, pp.334-33
    
    THESIS: Adrian Leftwich critically examines democracy, arguing that while it is often idealized as the best form of governance, its effectiveness depends on specific socio-political and economic conditions. He provides a nuanced perspective, acknowledging both its merits and limitations in practice.
    
    ---
    
    ### **1. Defining Democracy**
    
    - **Core Idea:** Democracy is often celebrated as a system of governance that emphasizes participation, accountability, and equality.
    - **Key Features:**
        - Free and fair elections.
        - Rule of law and protection of individual rights.
        - Active citizen engagement in political processes.
    
    ---
    
    ### **2. The Merits (excellence) of Democracy**
    
    - **Legitimacy:** Democracies derive power from the consent of the governed, fostering political stability.
    - **Flexibility:** Democratic systems allow for peaceful transitions of power and adaptability to changing societal needs.
    - **Human Rights:** By prioritising individual freedoms, democracies often ensure better protection of human rights compared to authoritarian regimes.
    
    ---
    
    ### **3. The Challenges and Critiques of Democracy**
    
    - **Economic Inequality:** Leftwich highlights how economic disparities can undermine the egalitarian principles of democracy, with wealthier groups often wielding disproportionate influence.
    - **Developmental Limitations:**
        - Democracy can sometimes hinder rapid decision-making, which may be necessary for economic development in emerging nations.
        - Comparatively, some authoritarian regimes have achieved significant developmental success due to their ability to implement long-term policies without electoral constraints.
    - **Institutional Weaknesses:**
        - In countries with weak institutions, democracy may lead to corruption, inefficiency, or populist policies that fail to address structural problems.
    
    ---
    
    ### **4. The Role of Context**
    
    - **Socioeconomic Preconditions:** Democracies function better in societies with higher levels of education, economic stability, and institutional development.
    - **Cultural Factors:** The success of democracy often depends on societal values, norms, and historical experiences that support democratic ideals.
    
    ---
    
    ### **5. Democracy and Development**
    
    - **Contradictory Relationship:**
        - While democracy is seen as a pathway to development, it is not always the most effective system for achieving rapid economic growth.
        - Authoritarian regimes in East Asia, for example, have achieved significant developmental milestones without democratic governance.
    - **Balanced View:** Leftwich argues that both democracy and non-democracy have roles in development, and the appropriate governance model depends on specific contexts.
    
    ---
    
    ### **6. Conclusion**
    
    - **Two Cheers, Not Three:** Leftwich advocates for a measured appreciation of democracy, recognizing its strengths but cautioning against overidealisation.
    - **Pragmatism Over Idealism:** He emphasises the need to focus on outcomes—whether democratic or authoritarian governance—while ensuring that human rights, development, and stability are prioritized.
- SEMINAR QUESTIONS
    
    ### Please discuss Lipset’s Political Man as a major work of democratic theory and identify the elements of the book that have established him as a ‘modernisation theorist’.
    
    **Significance of the Book**
    
    - *Political Man* is a landmark work that systematically explores the social and economic foundations of democracy.
    - Lipset connects socioeconomic factors with democratic stability, providing a data-driven framework that has shaped modern political sociology.
    
    **Elements Establishing Lipset as a Modernisation Theorist**
    
    1. **Economic Development:**
        - Argues that wealthier societies are more likely to sustain democracy due to reduced inequality, class conflict, and greater social stability.
        - Famous claim: “The more well-to-do a nation, the greater the chances it will sustain democracy.”
    2. **Social Transformation:**
        - Highlights how industrialization, urbanization, and modernization weaken traditional elites and foster a politically active middle class, which demands representation.
        - Urbanization enables political mobilization and communication, critical for democratic participation.
    3. **Education:**
        - Identifies education as vital for fostering informed, tolerant citizens who support democratic norms and institutions.
    4. **Political Legitimacy:**
        - Links economic progress to government legitimacy, arguing that a government perceived as effective in improving living conditions gains public support, stabilizing democracy.
    
    **Legacy**
    
    - Lipset’s emphasis on the interplay between economic and social development with democracy solidifies his status as a modernisation theorist. His work remains a cornerstone for understanding democratization and its social requisites.
    
    ### Warm up question: What is modernity/modernisation?
    
    - **Modernity:** Refers to the transformation of societies through industrialization, urbanization, technological progress, and the rise of secular, rational worldviews. It is marked by shifts in social structures, governance, and cultural practices.
        - Modernity = the Western way to progress, through industrialisation, and looking down upon non-Western alternative ways to progress
        - Modernity also often leads to a more universal society, where
    - **Modernisation:** The process by which traditional societies transition into modern ones. It involves economic development, industrialization, education, urbanization, and the diffusion of democratic values.
    
    ### Please identify and discuss (!) the major tenets of modernisation theory. What is the guiding logic behind modernisation theory?
    
    - **Economic Development:** Economic growth and industrialization lead to social changes that foster democracy. A wealthier society is generally more stable, informed, and politically active.
    - **Social Transformation:** Modernisation fosters higher education, urbanization, and the emergence of a middle class, which demands political participation.
    - **Diffusion of Power:** Economic progress weakens traditional elites and redistributes power across broader segments of society, enabling democratic governance.
    - **Cultural Shift:** Modernisation promotes secular and rational attitudes, reducing deference to authority and encouraging critical engagement.
    - **Guiding Logic:** Modernisation theory posits that economic and social development create the conditions necessary for democracy. As societies develop economically, they also evolve culturally and politically toward democratic norms.
    
    ### Why is Lipset’s Some Social Requisites…considered a landmark study in democratisation? What is its central argument?
    
    - Landmark study = a research work or publication that has had a significant and lasting impact on a particular field of study
    - **Landmark Status:** Lipset’s work is foundational in linking socioeconomic factors to democratic stability and development. It provides a systematic framework to understand how economic and social conditions support democracy.
    - **Central Argument:** Lipset argues that democracy is more likely to emerge and endure in societies with higher levels of wealth, education, industrialization, and urbanization. These factors contribute to political legitimacy and reduce social conflict.
    
    ### Please identify and discuss Lipset’s ‘social requisites of democracy’. Why are they (according to Lipset) conducive to democracy?
    
    - **Wealth:** Reduces economic inequality and class conflict, fostering stability.
    - **Education:** An educated electorate is better informed, more tolerant, and more engaged in civic life.
    - **Industrialization:** Promotes economic productivity and creates a middle class that demands representation.
    - **Urbanization:** Urban areas facilitate communication, political activism, and the spread of democratic ideas.
    - **Why They’re Conducive to Democracy:** These factors collectively create a stable and participatory society where citizens are more likely to value and support democratic institutions. They also reduce the power of traditional elites and foster pluralism.
    
    ### Why can Leftwich be regarded as a ‘modernisation theorist’? How, if at all, does his theory differ from Lipset’s?
    
    - **Alignment with Modernisation Theory:**
        - Leftwich emphasizes the importance of socioeconomic conditions (e.g., industrialization, education, urbanization) in shaping governance systems.
        - He acknowledges that development can create conditions conducive to democracy by redistributing power and reducing social inequalities.
    - **Differences from Lipset:**
        - Leftwich takes a more pragmatic and context-dependent approach. While Lipset sees modernisation as a linear progression toward democracy, Leftwich argues that non-democratic systems can also achieve development and stability.
        - Leftwich is critical of the assumption that democracy is always the best system for development, highlighting successful examples of authoritarian development (e.g., East Asia).
- CLASS
    
    ### What is modernisation theory?
    
    SUMMARY: Economic development → cultural shift → democratisation
    
    Economic development → industrialisation & urbanisation → more educated people → larger middle class → shift from survival values to expressionist values → political mobilisation for more political freedoms and questioning authority → democratisation
    
    ### Criticisms of Lipset
    
    - here are so many outliers in Lipset’s modernisation theory
        - India, Botswana: poor but democracies
        - Saudi Arabia, Singapore: rich but non-democracies
        - Egypt: had a lot of urbanisation, however most of them were illiterate and not educated → not leading to democratisation
            - Because Lipset had the assumption that urbanisation → larger and more educated middle class
            - But Egypt debunks his assumption, and therefore his theory does not hold in that case because his assumption does not hold, which therefore cannot lead to the outcome of democratisation
    - Show there are weaknesses in the modernisation theory
    - Lipset is not making a causal argument
    
    ### My criticism of Modernisation Theory
    
    [IN DETAIL](https://www.notion.so/IN-DETAIL-17b6ffb413178053b792d601d0fefbe7?pvs=21)
    
    - I agree that modernisation theory is useful to explain the democratisation and economic development of many capitalist Western countries
    - However, I disagree with the very concept of ‘modernisation’, as I do not believe that modernisation - which is dominating in todays world - is the best form of progress of societies, that will benefit the most people
        - Modernisation = more economic development, manufacturing for profit…
        - Capitalism = where the whole society is built around profit maximisation
    - My preferred form of progress:
        - live in harmony and one with nature
        - progress with more connection to nature and find more ways to self-sustain

### ESSAY OUTLINES

- What happens to societies when they modernise? What are the political
consequences likely to be?

Jisc Online Surveys [music]Hello, and welcome to the 10th and final topicin the Research Design and Statistics 2B module.In this topic, we will turn our attention to computer programming.Our aim is that by the end of this topic, you will have enough understandingof computer programming to be able to create experimentsusing a range of different visual and auditory stimuli on the one hand,while recording response times, accuracy,and providing feedback and assistance on the other.Additionally, by the end of this topic, you should have sufficient knowledgeof a platform known as JISC Online Surveysthat you can use to create online surveysthat will allow you to obtain questionnaire datafrom participants.The content of this topic is based on two main assumptions.The first is that we assume that you have no prior knowledgeof computer programming.Therefore, all the content is very much designed to be introductory.Don't worry, if you're not even sure what computer programming is.All will be explained in the activities in this topic.The second assumption is you should not expectto be an expert computer programmerby the end of this topic.When you learn computer programming, you are learning a language,which is in this topic, mainly the Python.In the same way that it takes many years, possibly even a lifetimeto learn a traditional language, it also takes yearsbefore you start becoming an expert in any computer programming language.Therefore, by the end of this topic,our expectation is that you will have some knowledgeof the basic elements required from which you can go off on your ownto learn more and develop better computer programming skills.You should not expect to be an expert purely from what you've learnedfrom the content of this topic.Even though I've been programming in MATLAB,HTML, R, and Python for more than 10 years,I would not consider myself an expert in any of these languages.At times, programming can be difficult, and sometimes even infuriating,but the benefits are massive in terms of your research.Let's cover the question, what do we mean by computer programming?Programming fundamentally refers to the steps that we taketo develop and implement a set of instructions that allow a computerto perform a certain task or set of different tasks.In the same way that when we're cooking or baking,we follow the steps of our recipe,completing different actions at different timesto produce the roast dinner or the chocolate cake we desire.A computer program is simply a set of instructionsthat we give a computer to followin order for it to produce a desired outcome.In experimental psychology, these instructions are used to ensurethat numerous features such as screen appearance,stimuli presentation,participant responding, and recording of all responsesall occur in a very specific and predefined waywhich ensures consistency across participants.It's very important to note that programming is not just importantfor experimental design and implementation,but can also be crucial in effective data analysis.Now that you know what computer programming is,the next question is, why should I learn computer programming?There are numerous reasons why learning to program can be incredibly useful.From experimental psychology point of view,being able to program provides us with greater freedomand flexibility in experimental design, data collection and analysis.If you know how to program,then when it comes to creating experiments,you're only constrained by your programming knowledge.Without any knowledge of programming, you will need other researchersto program for you,and this will reduce your experimental freedom and flexibility.Furthermore, programming allows us to automate boring and repetitive tasks,saving us time and energy.Is also a fantastic way to practice logical thinking,as we need to think about every single step in our experimentand the order in which they must be completed.Finally, computer programming is becoming an increasingly sought-after skill, both inside and outside academia,and being able to state that you have some knowledgewill help to strengthen any CV.We will look at two final questions.The first thing, why am I being taught the Python computer programming language?There are numerous reasons for learning Python.Here, I will highlight just a couple of key things.First, Python is one of the most widely used programming languagesin the world.At different times, Google, Netflix, Instagram, and Spotify, as well as NASA,and the British National Health Service, the NHS, have all usedor continue to use the Python programming languagein their software.Its popularity and widespread usemeans it is a good language to learn first,because it means that there is a wealthof online support available.Any problems you encounter with Pythonwill have encountered a thousand times before,and there will be advice available online for all of them.Secondly, as highlighted above,Python is used on such a diverse range of applications,making it popular both inside and outside academia,and as we said before, this is good for your CVs.In addition, Python is referred to as a high-level language,which simply means it is closer to standard Englishthan many other programming languages.As a result, scripts in Python are far more readablethan many other programming languages.Python also runs across all platforms; Windows, Mac, and Linux,and in many cases, comes pre-installed.If it is not pre-installed on your machine already,then it's free to download, thus, making it more accessible as a language.Finally, you should learn Python because it allows you to use PsychoPy,which brings us on to final question,why are we using PsychoPy?PsychoPy is a software packagethat allows programmers to create any conceivable experimental designthrough the use of both a Coder interface and/or a Builder (GUI) interface.This is perfect for computer programming novicesbecause the Builder allows someone with little to no programming knowledgeto create a standard, but sophisticated experimentwithout having to write a single line of code.Plus, it gives you the freedom and flexibilityand experiment to design and implementationusually only afforded to expert programs.PsychoPy also provides the code for everythingalready designed in the Builder, and thus, provide you with the opportunityto learn more complex skills in Python.If you do have some knowledge of programming,then the Coder part of PsychoPy allows you to implement more complexand specific design features.As a result, many experienced programmersuse the Builder to design the vast majority of the experimentand only switch to the Coder to add in very specific design features.This brings us to the end of the introductionto computer programming lecture.Hopefully, you now have a better understandingof what computer programming is,why it is a useful skill to acquire,and why Python is a good first language to learn.I hope you enjoy learning to program as much as I enjoy it.[music]"
"Summarize the following documents in bullet points. Do not include any information that is not in the original text. Foreign policymakers in China have long realized that its “unstoppable” rise
to international prominence would cause problems with how outsiders view
China. Rising powers, especially those from outside the status quo dominant
culture, tend to elicit much fear and consternation in foreign publics. To offset
this, China has spent billions on public diplomacy (PD) initiatives—such as
the Beijing Olympics, glitzy promotional videos, international media expansion, and the proliferation of Confucius Institutes across the globe—to
articulate to the rest of the world its international role and vision. Particularly
important to this has been the narrative of a peaceful rise: the notion that
China’s rise is more co-operative and friendly than the competitive and imperialist nature of previous “Western” rising powers. Under Xi Jinping (2017), China
has been telling international audiences that it is open for business and that it
welcomes an international setting that is interconnected, co-operative, and
fairer—a setting in which China envisages itself as a prominent global leader (see
for instance Xi, 2017)..
However, despite this unprecedented investment in PD since the late 2000s,
China seemingly has little to show for this (Edney et al., 2019). External perceptions of China have grown increasingly negative in recent years, especially as
China has become embroiled in international disputes and received significant
negative press over its policies in Hong Kong, Tibet, and Xinjiang. The onset
of the COVID-19 pandemic, which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has
further accelerated this negative spiral and it appears that China’s dreams of
international leadership based on a peaceful rise narrative are increasingly
unlikely (Silver et al., 2020). China is increasingly seen as a country that is
incapable of utilizing soft power; rather, it is perceived as using soft power with
a zero-sum hard power logic, resulting in what Christopher Walker and Jessica
Ludwig (2017) characterize as sharp power: a mixture of manipulation, coercion, and attraction. Consequently, as it stands, very few external partners—
and certainly no prominent countries—are looking to China for leadership and
rather, China is emerging as something of a perceived revisionist power to the
putative international order (Panda, 2021).
Importantly, the domestic setting and how it impacts China’s PD efforts
cannot be eschewed from the story of China’s failure to successfully engage
DOI: 10.4324/9781003254157-6
with foreign audiences so far. Somewhat ironically, China’s large investment
in PD initiatives may be paying more dividends at home than abroad. Events
like the Beijing Olympics heralded China’s positioning as a major power in
the world for China’s own populace—the external recognition of the importance and position in the world, and a show of the vast resources that can be
mobilized for mega-events. The message for domestic audiences was that
China under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was
achieving the return of national rejuvenation (民族复兴). The lavish display
of the Olympics, the reach of CIs, and global broadcast expansion are symbolic evidence of a return to the more than a century-long sentiment of a
powerful and wealthy nation (富强 国).
An emerging problem for China’s foreign policymakers is, however, that the
domestic setting increasingly influences the nature and content of PD as well
(Yang, 2020). To this end, rising nationalism and, even, xenophobia in China
are creating domestic expectations of what Chinese foreign engagement
should look like (Tam and Lee, 2018). For example, nationalist expectations
looking for reciprocal recognition and action in the international arena that
accords with their visions of China’s rise to power have gained support with
elites and spills over into foreign policy. As Christensen (2011, p. 54) notes,
“…Chinese policymakers are hypersensitive to nationalist criticism at home
and more rigid – at more times more arrogant – in response to perceived
challenges abroad”.
To explore the inherent challenges that China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(MFA) faces in simultaneously appeasing internal calls for bellicose posturing
with building international relationships attuned to softer aspects of power,
this chapter is divided into four sections. First, a conceptually-informed analytical framework for assessing social media PD engagement, using Robert
Putnam’s concept of the two-level game, will be built. Second, a closer look at
the two-level game in China’s PD will be undertaken. Third, an analysis of
the MFA of China’s engagement with both domestic and international audiences
is presented. Last, a discussion of the results with regards the policy implications
for Chinese PD policymakers is offered. This chapter argues that China’s foreign
policymakers are facing a particularly challenging two-level game in balancing
the international and domestic levels. In so doing, it makes a contribution to the
literature on PD and the “non-traditional” focus on the domestic by shedding
light on the dynamics between domestic and international levels in policy and
communications.
Public diplomacy, two-level games, and social media
The initial understanding of PD was that it represented an effort by a state’s
diplomatic institutions to shape a foreign public’s perceptions to create
favourable conditions for advancing foreign policy objectives (Cull, 2006).
Such a minimalist definition of PD has been subsequently challenged, but
there does remain a predilection in the literature that requires the state to be
64 China’s International Communication and Relationship Building
the main actor carrying out diplomatic activities with foreign publics for an
action to be characterized as PD. Consequently, the role of the domestic setting of the state engaging in PD has often been overlooked in the literature.
However, since the distinction of “traditional” and “non-traditional” forms of
PD, scholars have made the argument that PD is not exclusively about states
projecting towards foreign audiences. This “new turn” in PD research has
emphasized PD as more than a one-way communication, as was traditionally
surmised, but rather as something that increasingly involves multi-directional
communication. States, therefore, engage in dialogues with foreign publics
and listen to their responses, creating a dynamic two-way relationship
(Melissen, 2011). The broadening of the concept of PD has brought with it an
increased focus on actors found at the domestic level—whether citizens, firms,
civil society organizations, local government and government bodies, or lobby
groups—conducting the PD at certain times and under certain conditions
(Ayhan, 2019). Thus, PD communication is not just two-way between a state
and a foreign public, but it is also two-way between a state and its citizenry.
Domestic audiences are important partners in networks that enable strategic
goals and play an integral role in influencing and being influenced by the
state’s PD institutions (Fitzpatrick, 2012).
This chapter adopts a more maximalist understanding of PD in which
there is significant (and dynamic) horizontal, vertical, and diagonal interaction between a state, its national citizenry, and foreign publics (Choi, 2019).
The domestic dimension of PD incorporates domestic audiences, their networks, and organizations in two main ways: as actors and agents of PD, and
as recipients and co-producers of state narratives. Domestic actors thus are
not passive recipients but rather active agents of the PD endeavour who may,
via their networks abroad, advance PD goals with potentially more effective
results than state-led attempts given that it is less top-down. For MFAs and
other state actors, explaining foreign policy actions to domestic audiences
(termed “domestic public diplomacy” or “domestic outreach”) also goes
some way to producing favourable public opinion conditions and meaning
making. As Melissen (2011, p. 20) explains:
In such a conception, the support of ‘at home’ citizens for international
policy choices is a pre-condition for effective public diplomacy abroad.
International messages must resonate at home, and a society’s projected
image must be embedded in its identity to be credible to foreign publics.
This arguably creates legitimacy for state actors when foreign policy receives
approval from its national citizenry and illegitimacy when it does not.
Despite an increasing focus in the PD literature on the domestic setting of a
state in PD activities, it is arguably still conceptually undeveloped as to how
domestic publics and foreign publics concurrently affect and are affected by
PD policymaking. To help remedy this, this chapter borrows from Robert
Putnam’s two-level game to offer insights into the dilemma that often faces
The Two-Level Game of China’s Public Diplomacy Efforts 65
policymakers sitting at the intersection of domestic and international audiences. Putnam (1988) demonstrated the integral interplay between the
domestic and the international in international negotiations through his conceptualization of the two-level game. The international game (the first level)
must be negotiated and then “ratified” through approval at the second
level—that of the domestic game—either formally through a voting type
mechanism or informally approved through public opinion (1988). Different
factors will go into influencing the outcome, the varying combination of
which Putnam refers to as “win-sets”. Ultimately, Putnam’s two-level game
demonstrated that when states engage in international negotiations and
are deciding on a policy or strategy, then there is always consideration of the
domestic level.
Proposing that the concepts of PD and two-level games could be synthesized is not novel. Knopf (1993), in his critique of the two-level game theory,
hinted that PD—in this case, Gorbachev’s use of PD in the context of the
intermediate-range nuclear forces negotiations—needed to be factored into
any analysis of international negotiations. Of course, one of the constraints
which precluded a marriage between the two concepts is that two-level game
theory strictly concerned the mechanisms of a more “traditional” and “official” diplomatic activity: international negotiations. International negotiations are diplomatic activities where the actors involved are clearly defined
and the goals for each actor are usually known to policymakers. It is something that is precise and can be clearly strategized. PD, on the other hand,
involves a wider array of actors, both state and non-state, while the aims and
goals are less well defined and more diffuse. PD is often driven by goals with
wide parameters of what constitutes “success”. Furthermore, international
negotiations tend to be big events that can pique the public’s interest and
imagination in the short term—which is when two-level games arise—while
PD is an activity that is ongoing and is harder to isolate and crystalize.
However, the usefulness of the notion of two-level games to understanding
and assessing PD activities has symbiotically grown with the ongoing social,
political, and consequently diplomatic impact of the digital revolution (Smith
and Brown, 2021). The entrenchment of the internet into all corners of society
across the globe has created a “digital blurring of the foreign and the domestic”
which has resulted in the use of “digital platforms by governments in support of
their foreign policy” (Bjola et al., 2019, pp. 85–86). For Bjola et al. (2019, p. 90):
From a public diplomacy perspective, digital technologies may be used to
facilitate or impede the two-level game of diplomacy. For instance, foreign
policy institutions may now use digital platforms to communicate with the
national citizenry to obtain public support for diplomatic treaties, which
may translate into political support.
In other words, the digital revolution has arguably expanded the two-level
game from mostly being viewed as a phenomenon that occurs during high-level
66 China’s International Communication and Relationship Building
international negotiations to one which is increasingly part of a state’s PD
efforts.
The growing importance of social media as a platform for state interaction with domestic and foreign audiences produces both opportunities
and constraints of the two-level game in contemporary PD activities. It is
common now for a state’s social media presence to comprise dozens of
different accounts, ranging from official accounts of various institutions (such
as the MFA) to the individual accounts of key people (such as ministers,
ambassadors, and practitioners). Regarding the opportunities social media
provides policymakers, Bjola and Manor (2018) analysed the Obama administration’s use of the Twitter social media platform to mobilize domestic support for the Iran Nuclear Agreement, which they argued was helpful in the
eventuation of Congressional authorization of the agreement. But, in other
cases, a state’s interaction with its national citizenry can create ripples that
impact foreign policymaking. Manor (2016, p. 21) cites the case of Michelle
Obama’s Twitter post of her holding a sign saying “#bringbackourgirls”, in
reference to the abduction of schoolgirls in Nigeria by the militant group
Boko Haram, which elicited a strong backlash and the counter hashtag
movement of “#bringbackyourdrones” to protest the United States’ ‘War on
Terror’.
Ultimately, PD as a component of a state’s diplomatic activities has
undergone significant evolution over the past couple of decades, largely
thanks to the changes brought about by the ongoing digital revolution.
Therefore, PD is no longer just a strategy for how a state can (one-way)
interact with a foreign public but, rather, a multi-directional and multiplatform phenomenon that involves an array of domestic and foreign actors.
An important impact of this is that it has expanded the two-level game from
being a particular phenomenon that arose at times of key international
negotiations to now being a continuous and permanent aspect of a state’s
PD efforts."

What is the brain?

The brain is a complex organ that controls thought, memory, emotion, touch, motor skills, vision, breathing, temperature, hunger and every process that regulates our body. Together, the brain and spinal cord that extends from it make up the central nervous system, or CNS.

What is the brain made of?

Weighing about 3 pounds in the average adult, the brain is about 60% fat. The remaining 40% is a combination of water, protein, carbohydrates and salts. The brain itself is a not a muscle. It contains blood vessels and nerves, including neurons and glial cells.

What is the gray matter and white matter?

Gray and white matter are two different regions of the central nervous system. In the brain, gray matter refers to the darker, outer portion, while white matter describes the lighter, inner section underneath. In the spinal cord, this order is reversed: The white matter is on the outside, and the gray matter sits within.

Cross sections of the brain and spinal cord, showing the grey and white matter.

Gray matter is primarily composed of neuron somas (the round central cell bodies), and white matter is mostly made of axons (the long stems that connects neurons together) wrapped in myelin (a protective coating). The different composition of neuron parts is why the two appear as separate shades on certain scans.

Parts of a nerve cell: the central soma cell body with inner nucleus and outer dendrites and long axon tail, insulated by myelin pads.

Each region serves a different role. Gray matter is primarily responsible for processing and interpreting information, while white matter transmits that information to other parts of the nervous system.

How does the brain work?

The brain sends and receives chemical and electrical signals throughout the body. Different signals control different processes, and your brain interprets each. Some make you feel tired, for example, while others make you feel pain.

Some messages are kept within the brain, while others are relayed through the spine and across the body’s vast network of nerves to distant extremities. To do this, the central nervous system relies on billions of neurons (nerve cells).

Main Parts of the Brain and Their Functions

At a high level, the brain can be divided into the cerebrum, brainstem and cerebellum.

Diagram of the brain's major parts: cerebrum, cerebellum and brainstem

Cerebrum

The cerebrum (front of brain) comprises gray matter (the cerebral cortex) and white matter at its center. The largest part of the brain, the cerebrum initiates and coordinates movement and regulates temperature. Other areas of the cerebrum enable speech, judgment, thinking and reasoning, problem-solving, emotions and learning. Other functions relate to vision, hearing, touch and other senses.

Cerebral Cortex

Cortex is Latin for “bark,” and describes the outer gray matter covering of the cerebrum. The cortex has a large surface area due to its folds, and comprises about half of the brain’s weight.

The cerebral cortex is divided into two halves, or hemispheres. It is covered with ridges (gyri) and folds (sulci). The two halves join at a large, deep sulcus (the interhemispheric fissure, AKA the medial longitudinal fissure) that runs from the front of the head to the back. The right hemisphere controls the left side of the body, and the left half controls the right side of the body. The two halves communicate with one another through a large, C-shaped structure of white matter and nerve pathways called the corpus callosum. The corpus callosum is in the center of the cerebrum.

Brainstem

The brainstem (middle of brain) connects the cerebrum with the spinal cord. The brainstem includes the midbrain, the pons and the medulla.

Midbrain. The midbrain (or mesencephalon) is a very complex structure with a range of different neuron clusters (nuclei and colliculi), neural pathways and other structures. These features facilitate various functions, from hearing and movement to calculating responses and environmental changes. The midbrain also contains the substantia nigra, an area affected by Parkinson’s disease that is rich in dopamine neurons and part of the basal ganglia, which enables movement and coordination.
Pons. The pons is the origin for four of the 12 cranial nerves, which enable a range of activities such as tear production, chewing, blinking, focusing vision, balance, hearing and facial expression. Named for the Latin word for “bridge,” the pons is the connection between the midbrain and the medulla.
Medulla. At the bottom of the brainstem, the medulla is where the brain meets the spinal cord. The medulla is essential to survival. Functions of the medulla regulate many bodily activities, including heart rhythm, breathing, blood flow, and oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. The medulla produces reflexive activities such as sneezing, vomiting, coughing and swallowing.
The spinal cord extends from the bottom of the medulla and through a large opening in the bottom of the skull. Supported by the vertebrae, the spinal cord carries messages to and from the brain and the rest of the body.

Cerebellum

The cerebellum (“little brain”) is a fist-sized portion of the brain located at the back of the head, below the temporal and occipital lobes and above the brainstem. Like the cerebral cortex, it has two hemispheres. The outer portion contains neurons, and the inner area communicates with the cerebral cortex. Its function is to coordinate voluntary muscle movements and to maintain posture, balance and equilibrium. New studies are exploring the cerebellum’s roles in thought, emotions and social behavior, as well as its possible involvement in addiction, autism and schizophrenia.

Brain Coverings: Meninges

Three layers of protective covering called meninges surround the brain and the spinal cord.

The outermost layer, the dura mater, is thick and tough. It includes two layers: The periosteal layer of the dura mater lines the inner dome of the skull (cranium) and the meningeal layer is below that. Spaces between the layers allow for the passage of veins and arteries that supply blood flow to the brain.
The arachnoid mater is a thin, weblike layer of connective tissue that does not contain nerves or blood vessels. Below the arachnoid mater is the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. This fluid cushions the entire central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and continually circulates around these structures to remove impurities.
The pia mater is a thin membrane that hugs the surface of the brain and follows its contours. The pia mater is rich with veins and arteries.
Three layers of the meninges beneath the skull: the outer dura mater, arachnoid and inner pia mater

Lobes of the Brain and What They Control

Each brain hemisphere (parts of the cerebrum) has four sections, called lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital. Each lobe controls specific functions.

Diagram of the brain's lobes: frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital

Frontal lobe. The largest lobe of the brain, located in the front of the head, the frontal lobe is involved in personality characteristics, decision-making and movement. Recognition of smell usually involves parts of the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe contains Broca’s area, which is associated with speech ability.
Parietal lobe. The middle part of the brain, the parietal lobe helps a person identify objects and understand spatial relationships (where one’s body is compared with objects around the person). The parietal lobe is also involved in interpreting pain and touch in the body. The parietal lobe houses Wernicke’s area, which helps the brain understand spoken language.
Occipital lobe. The occipital lobe is the back part of the brain that is involved with vision.
Temporal lobe. The sides of the brain, temporal lobes are involved in short-term memory, speech, musical rhythm and some degree of smell recognition.
Deeper Structures Within the Brain

Pituitary Gland

Sometimes called the “master gland,” the pituitary gland is a pea-sized structure found deep in the brain behind the bridge of the nose. The pituitary gland governs the function of other glands in the body, regulating the flow of hormones from the thyroid, adrenals, ovaries and testicles. It receives chemical signals from the hypothalamus through its stalk and blood supply.

Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus is located above the pituitary gland and sends it chemical messages that control its function. It regulates body temperature, synchronizes sleep patterns, controls hunger and thirst and also plays a role in some aspects of memory and emotion.

Amygdala

Small, almond-shaped structures, an amygdala is located under each half (hemisphere) of the brain. Included in the limbic system, the amygdalae regulate emotion and memory and are associated with the brain’s reward system, stress, and the “fight or flight” response when someone perceives a threat.

Hippocampus

A curved seahorse-shaped organ on the underside of each temporal lobe, the hippocampus is part of a larger structure called the hippocampal formation. It supports memory, learning, navigation and perception of space. It receives information from the cerebral cortex and may play a role in Alzheimer’s disease.

Pineal Gland

The pineal gland is located deep in the brain and attached by a stalk to the top of the third ventricle. The pineal gland responds to light and dark and secretes melatonin, which regulates circadian rhythms and the sleep-wake cycle.

Ventricles and Cerebrospinal Fluid

Deep in the brain are four open areas with passageways between them. They also open into the central spinal canal and the area beneath arachnoid layer of the meninges.

The ventricles manufacture cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF, a watery fluid that circulates in and around the ventricles and the spinal cord, and between the meninges. CSF surrounds and cushions the spinal cord and brain, washes out waste and impurities, and delivers nutrients.

Diagram of the brain's deeper structures

Blood Supply to the Brain

Two sets of blood vessels supply blood and oxygen to the brain: the vertebral arteries and the carotid arteries.

The external carotid arteries extend up the sides of your neck, and are where you can feel your pulse when you touch the area with your fingertips. The internal carotid arteries branch into the skull and circulate blood to the front part of the brain.

The vertebral arteries follow the spinal column into the skull, where they join together at the brainstem and form the basilar artery, which supplies blood to the rear portions of the brain.

The circle of Willis, a loop of blood vessels near the bottom of the brain that connects major arteries, circulates blood from the front of the brain to the back and helps the arterial systems communicate with one another.

Diagram of the brain's major arteries

Cranial Nerves

Inside the cranium (the dome of the skull), there are 12 nerves, called cranial nerves:

Cranial nerve 1: The first is the olfactory nerve, which allows for your sense of smell.
Cranial nerve 2: The optic nerve governs eyesight.
Cranial nerve 3: The oculomotor nerve controls pupil response and other motions of the eye, and branches out from the area in the brainstem where the midbrain meets the pons.
Cranial nerve 4: The trochlear nerve controls muscles in the eye. It emerges from the back of the midbrain part of the brainstem.
Cranial nerve 5: The trigeminal nerve is the largest and most complex of the cranial nerves, with both sensory and motor function. It originates from the pons and conveys sensation from the scalp, teeth, jaw, sinuses, parts of the mouth and face to the brain, allows the function of chewing muscles, and much more.
Cranial nerve 6: The abducens nerve innervates some of the muscles in the eye.
Cranial nerve 7: The facial nerve supports face movement, taste, glandular and other functions.
Cranial nerve 8: The vestibulocochlear nerve facilitates balance and hearing.
Cranial nerve 9: The glossopharyngeal nerve allows taste, ear and throat movement, and has many more functions.
Cranial nerve 10: The vagus nerve allows sensation around the ear and the digestive system and controls motor activity in the heart, throat and digestive system.
Cranial nerve 11: The accessory nerve innervates specific muscles in the head, neck and shoulder.
Cranial nerve 12: The hypoglossal nerve supplies motor activity to the tongue.
The first two nerves originate in the cerebrum, and the remaining 10 cranial nerves emerge from the brainstem, which has three parts: the midbrain, the pons and the medulla."

Abstract
Academics are increasingly using the concept of populism to make sense of
current events such as the Brexit referendum and the Trump presidency.
This is certainly a welcome development, but two shortcomings can be
observed in the contemporary debate. On one hand, new populism scholars
often start from scratch and do not build upon the existing research. On
the other hand, those who have been doing comparative research on
populism stay in their comfort zone and thus do not try to link their work
to other academic fields. In this article, we address these two shortcomings
by discussing some of the advantages of the so-called ideational approach
to the comparative study of populism and by pointing out four avenues of
future research, which are closely related to some of the contributions of
this special issue, namely, (a) economic anxiety, (b) cultural backlash, (c)
the tension between responsiveness and responsibility, and (d) (negative)
partisanship and polarization.

Introduction
Although populists had been making headlines across the globe for at least
two decades, the British European Union (EU) referendum and the rise of
Donald Trump have led to an unprecedented proliferation of articles, news
coverage, and op-eds on populism. Not by chance, the Cambridge dictionary
declared ""populism"" the word of the year 2017. Although the concept of populism is indeed helpful to understand contemporary politics, an increasing
number of academics and pundits are using it mainly as a buzzword. This
means that populism is often poorly defined and used in wrong ways. Yet,
there is a growing group of scholars who work with similar, though not identical, definitions, broadly referred to as the ""ideational approach,"" which is
particularly well-suited for comparative research on populism, be it qualitative or quantitative in method.
In this introduction to the special issue, we argue that new populism scholars should not start from scratch, but rather build upon the lessons that the
existing academic literature offers. At the same time, scholars who have been
doing (comparative) research on populism should try to link their work to
other academic literatures and traditions, as this will permit the scholarly
community to explore new avenues of research with the aim of producing
new and better knowledge. We will discuss in more detail how insights from
various related literatures, most notably electoral and party studies as well as
scholarship on the radical right, can be better integrated into future populism
research.
We first address the advantages of the so-called ideational approach to the
comparative study of populism and then point out four avenues of future
research, which are closely related to the contributions of this special issue,
namely, (a) economic anxiety, (b) cultural backlash, (c) the tension between
responsiveness and responsibility, and (d) (negative) partisanship and polarization. We hereby draw upon some of the work that we have written in the
last few years, upon the research of colleagues studying populism as well as
related topics (such as the radical right), and on the"

"Imagine you are a top student at the London School of Economics: help me make a 1500 word academic review essay about the main criticisms of Modernisation Theory for the subject ""Democracy and Democratisation"""
"put all this information into an essay paragraph about the general features of modernisation theory: Most wealthy countries are liberal democracies  
There is a historical trend according to which democracies tended to democratise as they became richer
but this does not suggest that they became democratic at the same pace or without struggle / conflict
It does not imply that poor countries cannot be democracies (eg India, Botswana)
Does not mean that democracy is the future trend (unpredictable)
But for the past century: a definite relation could be established between affluence and democracy → not whether but why is this true?

Economic development and democracy
Does economic development lead to democracy? → first asked in the US
End of WW2, Eu imperial empires declined, Soviet communism seen as an alternative to Eu colonialism
The US argued: independent countries would gradually increase their national wealth → would lead to social change → would ultimately bring about democracy and development
Criticism: too optimistic, evolutionary
De-emphasises the importance of political culture and the historical specificity of each country
Modernisation theory: relatively simple explanation that does not seek to cover everything
Advantages of Modernization Theory:
Offers insights into broad trends and phenomena that support democracy:
Affluent societies generally experience less internal inequality and a wider diffusion of economic power than poorer societies
These conditions align with theories emphasizing limited inequality (e.g., Vanhanen, Rueschemeyer) or affluence as key to democracy
improvements in living standards in First World countries since 1950 contribute to democratic stability:
Economic growth and rising real incomes → greater life satisfaction and reduced anti-democratic tendencies
Post-1945 stability:
The absence of major wars has supported democratic stability (but regional conflicts persist)
Potentially negative impacts of nuclear warfare on democratic stability remain speculative but concerning European history provides examples of how economic power influenced political accountability:
The Duke of Wellington and Reform in the 1830s:
The Duke resisted reforms to maintain a semi-monarchical political system.
His opponents used economic tactics, such as organizing a bank run, to force reforms.
The slogan “To stop the Duke, go for gold” symbolized how financial power could be wielded to challenge political structures.
Such events illustrate how economic changes disrupt traditional systems and compel accountability, aligning with modernization theory’s principles
Giddens (1990): modernity is inherently globalizing = it spreads across the world, creating one uniform culture
Modernization theory → links democratization with globalization
links the spread of democracy to modernity and the Enlightenment idea of the universality of progress
Modernization codified within democratization studies by Lipset (1959)
draws on a mix of Weberian notions of the ‘modern’ state and
the preoccupation of classical sociology with describing the social transitions (from feudalism to capitalism, from traditional to modern, from ascription to achievement) in the 19th-20th centuries
Parsons (1951): identified modernity as a passage from diffuseness to specificity and from particularism to universalism
In modernisation theory the characteristics of modernity are generally laid down as benchmarks for all developing or non-democratic societies to achieve
Modernity equated with the processes of change in the 19th century in the UK, the US and in Western Europe generally
Modern society = product of capitalism
Lipset: modernity is a single universal experience → leading to similar societies and states
modernization is functionalist and economistic → it sees democracy as an outcome of capitalism
associates economic growth in a causal relationship with progress
Predictive: democracy appears in those societies that are able to ‘replicate the original transition’ to capitalism (Roxborough 1979) and become enmeshed in global economic structures
Lipset, 1959: capitalism is the heart of democracy because it produces wealth
he assumed it would trickle down and lead to higher levels of mass consumption
led to an educated middle class and cultural changes favourable to democracy (eg increased secularism and decrease in ascriptive and primordial identities)


capitalism diminished class conflict:
Economic development (incl. increased income, economic security, education) → enables the lower strata to adopt more complex political perspectives and reduces their susceptibility to extremist ideologies
Creates a larger middle class that moderates conflict and supports democratic and reformist ideals (Lipset, 1959)


strengthened by Rostow (1960) → identified a lineal path for economic (only) development along defined ‘stages’ until capitalism was achieved
the traditional society; the pre-take-off society; take-off; the road to maturity; and the mass consumption society
DV1171 WEEK 3
Simultaneously ideas developed about how a society's political culture (= its shared beliefs, values, and attitudes about politics) affects the process of becoming a democracy (Pye and Verba 1965; Almond and Verba 1963)
→  linked democracy to a particular political culture = one which channelled mass participation in an orderly, non-mobilizing and low-key fashion and encouraged secular and elite-led government
political culture sought to explain the difficulties societies encountered in becoming ‘modern’
Linked material progress and democracy to modernity → thereby increased the acceptability of Lipset’s thesis
emphasis on culture has re-emerged in studies of contemporary democratization

Economic development
Industrialisation, urbanisation → the masses become more educated, bigger middle class → demanding more rights
Shift from survival to expression based values → Class struggle becomes less extreme 
democratisation

Urbanisation does not necessarily lead to a more educated middle class → depends on what??
Outliers: Egypt
Saudi Arabia, Singapore: high economic growth but dictatorships
India, Botswana: poor but democracy
Germany, France: very well educated societies but for a long time not democratic
(addressed by Lipset: can be outliers but if you study them there is a reason for them to be outliers

Evaluating Modernisation Theory
Strength: tried to specify the particular components of capitalism that make democracy
Weakness: assumes an overly simple and linear relationship between capitalism and democracy
Critics: modernization theory is ahistorical, ethnocentric and overly structural

Modernisation theory is historical:
it presumes that all societies can replicate a transition which actually occurred at a particular moment in space and time

"The Australian government has long viewed its alliance with the United States as critical to its security. But should Australia continue to do so if it weakens its national security and bilateral relationships?   This September marks seventy years since the signing of the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty (ANZUS) by the Australian, New Zealand, and US governments. ANZUS came to fruition after advocacy by Australia and New Zealand for a treaty with the US due to their fears of communist China and post-war Japan. It was signed by the US in exchange for Australia and New Zealand supporting a ‘soft’ peace treaty with Japan. Since this time, the Australia-US alliance has been at the core of Australia’s security and defence policy and has been supported by both Liberal and Labor governments. However, this alliance, within which Australian governments are often dependent upon and submissive to the US, has, at times, undermined Australia’s security and bilateral relationships.  Australia has participated in all major US-led wars since the beginning of the Cold War, notably in Korea, Vietnam, the 1991 Gulf War, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, thus demonstrating its subservience to the US. In a number of these cases, Australian governments contributed military forces in the belief that demonstrating that Australia was a “good” ally would be reciprocated by the US if this was required by Australia. In the case of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, unlike a number of other US allies, staunchly pro-US Prime Minister John Howard committed Australian forces to the invasion even though it was not sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council and thus the legality of the invasion was questionable.  In 2002, al-Qaeda-affiliated Indonesian terrorist organisation Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) perpetrated the Bali bombings, which killed 88 Australians. The leader of JI subsequently argued that Australians were targeted in the bombings due to Australia’s alliance with the US and participation in the war in Afghanistan. In this instance, the Australia-US alliance and Australia’s involvement in US-led wars to present itself as a “good” ally directly undermined Australian security.  Additionally, the Pine Gap intelligence facility in the Northern Territory, a key part of the Australia-US alliance, also poses a direct threat to Australia’s security. Pine Gap has been run and funded by the US and, to a lesser degree, Australia since it began operating in the 1970s. The facility provides the US and Australia with key intelligence, including intelligence which is used by the US for drone strikes, which violate international law and have resulted in civilians being killed, notably in the Middle East. Its surveillance systems can also provide advanced warning of nuclear attacks directed at the US. As a result, if China and the US engage in a war, Pine Gap would likely be a high priority nuclear target for China.  In 2011, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced that Australia would host 2500 US marines on permanent rotation in the Northern Territory. Unsurprisingly, Gillard’s announcement was viewed with hostility by China, Australia’s largest trading partner. This decision was also greeted with antagonism by Indonesia, the fourth-most populous country in the world, and a rising economic power and influential Southeast Asian state, which is also Australia’s largest neighbour. Therefore, Australia’s actions, and its dependence on the US undermined its relationship with two key Asian states and created another source of tension in its already volatile relationship with both countries.  Proponents of the alliance also argue that Australia can rely on US extended nuclear deterrence. Extended nuclear deterrence refers to the notion that the US would protect Australia with nuclear weapons if another state threatened or launched a nuclear attack against Australia, and such protection would deter nuclear attacks against Australia. In reality, due to the Truman administration’s preference for a limited security treaty, the 1951 ANZUS treaty only guarantees that the US and Australia will “consult” with each other if one of them is attacked. By contrast, the 1949 NATO treaty stipulates that an attack perpetrated against one state party to the treaty is viewed as an attack on all state parties to the treaty, who will then support the attacked state. Guarantees of US extended nuclear deterrence are also questionable as there is no public US government statement that the US would protect Australia with nuclear weapons if it experiences a nuclear attack or threat.  Beyond this, Australian governments’ reliance on extended nuclear deterrence is problematic as it demonstrates that Australian governments endorse nuclear weapons despite the immense human and environmental harms associated with them. It also highlights that successive Australian governments’ assertions that Australia is committed to nuclear disarmament are highly debatable.  Australian governments should rethink their fundamental assumptions about the alliance and the extent to which, in its current manifestation, the alliance benefits Australia. Successive Australian governments have, at times, criticised US government policies and demonstrated an ability to adopt policies which are in Australia’s national interest, rather than solely adopting policies to bolster the US alliance and demonstrate that Australia is, in the words of Gillard, “a true friend down under.” Australian governments would do well to adopt more policies which genuinely advance Australia’s interests.

The foreign policy decision-making process is a major focus of FPA scholarship seeking to unlock and explain the complexities of state conduct in
the international system. In this regard, rationality and its application to
foreign policy decision making is one of the most influential approaches
to understanding contemporary international politics. Derived from public choice theory – which itself emerged out of the fields of economics
and policy sciences – rational choice scholars have actively sought to utilize a well-established methodology of decision making in the context
of foreign policy. Applying this approach to the task of modelling the
complex environment of foreign policy decision making has, nonetheless,
posed new challenges for rationalists. 1 The result has been the development of innovations in modelling choice in areas as diverse as nuclear
strategy and trade negotiations, which have become influential in academic and foreign policy-making circles.
The use of rationalist approaches to analyse foreign policy decision
making, at the same time, has inspired considerable commentary and criticism. Indeed, the formative work of FPA has been devoted to assessing
the weaknesses of this school of thought and its links to realist assumptions. 2 This critique of rationalist accounts of foreign policy decision
making is rooted as much in its inability to accurately capture the actual
foreign policy process as in the problems posed by some of its foundational assumptions. Culling from studies of political psychology and
cognitive theory, FPA scholars have focused on the centrality of the mind
of the decision maker, its powerful effect on the framing of particular
foreign policy issues and the consequent impact on the formulation and
selection of policy options. The subsequent research conducted into the
role of perceptual factors and cognitive shortcomings highlights the many
distortions integral to the decision-making process, challenging the very

possibility of achieving rationality in foreign policy. Introducing the problematic of foreign policy implementation, as we will see as the argument
unfolds, exposes rationalist assumptions to a further round of criticisms.
Yet there remains within much of FPA a desire to retain adherence
to a broadly rationalist description of foreign policy decision making.
Notions such as ‘bounded rationality’, which seek to account for the
distorting effects of partial information and narrowing perceptions, are
suggestive of the continuing relevance of rational choice theory – albeit
somewhat reconstituted in light of criticisms – to any accounts of the
decision-making process. James Rosenau’s clarion call to identify variables and rigorous methodologies to better organize the study of foreign
policy – which led to the ill-fated comparative foreign policy research
programme – while embracing much of the critique of rationalism in
setting out his FPA ‘pre-theories’, nonetheless seeks to frame the research
agenda squarely within the realm of positivism. 3 The ‘pull of rationalism’ as a method, however attenuated to account for critiques, remains an
important dimension of FPA. The result is that contemporary scholars
have developed new methodological approaches to foreign policy decision making, which are explicitly aimed at reconciling the contingencies
of rationality with the insights derived from its various critics."

"Please summarize the follwoing texts in bullet points. Do not include any information that is not in the original text. I need a detailed summary. Abstract
With the international system shifting away from Pax Americana and toward a more multipolar world, a
class of state actors usually called ‘middle powers’ is the subject of increased attention in policy and academic
debates. Despite their rising prevalence, however, references to middle powers are often imprecise, inconsistent, surface level, and ad hoc—reflecting a general bias toward great powers and/or universalism that
privileges systemic (global) analysis in mainstream international relations. Drawing on neoclassical realism,
cultural realism, security studies, and new regionalist theory, we seek to fill this gap and propose a new and
original definition of middle powers across four vectors.
We show that middle powers are better defined by their 1) enduring regional presence and geographic rootedness, 2) considerable economic and military capacity relative to neighbors, 3) historical and cultural pedigree as civilizational states, and 4) the regionally-focused, limited extent of their ambitions — they seek not
world domination but a sphere of influence in their near-abroad matching their historical range and scope.
The latter offers a key contrast with great powers. The limited, concrete aims of middle powers along with
a proper focus on vital interests, territorial sovereignty, and realpolitik born of necessity preclude imperial
designs and often mitigate against ideological decision-making.
Given the decline of unipolarity, growing disruptions and backlashes to globalization, and the fracturing and
realignment of the global financial and political-economic system, region-based economic and political dynamics are likely to become ever more central to international politics. Understanding future geopolitical
trends will depend on recognizing the reality and centrifugal force of multiplicity at the regional or sub-system level to which middle powers are anchored in a cohesive unity—with each civilizational node, the fulcrum of a regional security complex (RSC).
Analogously, some of the premises and theories of neo-realism, traditionally conceptualized globally, are
more salutary when applied regionally, where they can be more concretely observed. We identify two strategic postures as especially salient among middle powers, framing and informing their interactions with great
powers and their attitude toward the prevailing systemic order (‘liberal international order’ in our case).
‘Status quo middle powers’, for which we offer Japan and Germany as examples, are those satisfied with the
relative balance of power in their RSC and working to sustain the extant order in an entente with the status
quo great power. In contrast, we present Turkey and Iran as ‘revisionist middle powers’. These states are
discontented with their overall standing and the relative balance of power in their RSC and seek to upend the
current order for a new one that elevates them, often in alignment with the revisionist great power.
While by no means the last word on the topic, we hope this study can stimulate further thinking and debate
on middle powers, especially given the advent of multipolarity and the renewed space and importance that
it offers the world’s many regions. Secondarily, this work is also intended as a contribution to a more open
and less monolithic conception of the international system—where a revitalized concept of multiplicity, the
reality of global cultural pluralism, and an emphasis on the role of ‘culture complexes’ combine to propel
civilizational states as foundational units in a more fluid, dynamic, and multiplex global system, one that is
more inter-civilizational than international. Ex Uno Plures (out of one, many), we say.

The Biden administration’s completion of the
American withdrawal from Afghanistan has triggered hyperbolic—and in light of Washington’s
bullish response to the Russo-Ukrainian War,1
frankly untenable—accusations of isolationism.2
The fading of the unipolar moment of American
dominance and the unilateral influence of the
United States is, however, hard to deny.3
In its reaction to 9/11, the U.S. misread the strength
of the unprecedented hegemony gifted to it by the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It went on to
pursue numerous endless wars, military interventions, and maximalist pressure campaigns around
the globe with dubious, yet costly, results and
flagging popular support.4
 All this during a time
that has since proved a crucial transitional period,
wherein the world witnessed the reassertion of
Russian military power and the growth of Chinese
technological and economic prowess.5
Having overreached and put itself in a more precarious position without expanding its relative
power against potential strategic rivals, the United
States must now re-examine the cost-benefit calculus of maintaining primacy in a changing world.

Much has been written about the opportunities
for rival great powers as the post-World War II
liberal international order (LIO) dissipates, but
comparatively little attention has been given to
the likely and substantial influence regional and
middle-tier powers could have in the (still-forming) multipolar order that promises to define the
remainder of 21st century.6
The Primacy of Regions and the Rise of
Middle Powers
Much of international relations scholarship, especially in the realist camp, focuses on super-/
great powers operating—and often competing—
within a global security dynamic (‘international
system’) to achieve security goals that are usually
deemed 'objective'. Not only are these great powers perceived as one another’s biggest competitors, potential conflict between these global poles
could be catastrophic: affecting not just them but
also engulfing the entire world (even more so in
the nuclear age). Therefore, a disproportionate
amount of effort goes to studying and attempting to predict—on the global plane—the behaviors, strategies, and trajectories of these rivals or
to speculate on ways to mitigate future conflict(s)
between them and/or lessen their severity.
In conceptualizing ‘great powers’, one would perhaps be forgiven for thinking rather exclusively at
the ‘system’ level or in terms of the global structure.7
 After all, the material capacity to overcome
the limitations of distance and geography is one
major identifier of a great power. Yet, geography

is much harder to transcend for lesser powers,
which are bounded spatially and territorially to
their respective regions and worry, above all,
about the regional designs and strategic objectives
of their neighbors.
It follows that such geographical and spatial realism frames and qualifies the security calculus of
this second class of powers more so than for great
powers.8
 Neither a great power nor a peripheral
state, middle powers—especially those discontented about their current status, role, and prestige—occupy an inherently dynamic position in
the emerging geopolitical mandala.9
 One could
not speak of ‘middle powers’ without taking into
account their symbiotic relationship with the geographical regions wherein they are located and
recognizing that “security interdependence is
normally patterned into regionally based clusters:
security complexes.”10
As such, this regional (and hence comparative)
characteristic of middle powers is largely dispositive. For example, Canada’s national wealth and
resources, contributions to peacekeeping during
the Cold War’s hot phase, and status as a member
of the G7 in its latter years have led some to deem
it a middle power.11 Yet, it is significantly weaker
than the United States in relative terms. Hence,
its ability to independently assert its interests in
its region—let alone in a global setting—is substantially constrained by its immediate southern

neighbor.
What is more, great powers are an ever-present
reality with which regional states must regularly
engage with and account for in formulating their
grand strategies. The specter of great power politics compels these supra-regional (i.e., super-)
powers to interject themselves in and penetrate
various world regions — even more so in order to
gain leverage in competition with their peers. As
great powers, they have a global reach and a more
enhanced capacity for force projection in faraway
areas, an ability which they use to either preserve
the extant balance of power (i.e., status quo) or to
secure relative power parity (i.e., revisionist). Important to note that power is here defined not exclusively in materialist terms but also encompassing soft power considerations such as cultural distinctiveness, normative influence, international
prestige, and the long-term viability of the worldview and form of life it animates.
The prospect of U.S. withdrawal from various regions amid the worldwide adjustments to multipolarity could increase opportunities for midrange powers to (re-)assert themselves in their respective regions in pursuit of regional dominance,
while offering them more strategic autonomy.
Their likely ascent, however, also increases the
risk of conflict between (geographically-) adjacent
middle powers in areas of overlapping security interests and mutual contention.
Since the end of the Cold War, it was widely assumed that ending open antagonism between
great powers would afford lesser powers greater room to maneuver. The National Intelligence
Council’s Global Trends 2030 report (2012) predicts, for instance, that middle powers will continue to gain in stature, exerting greater influence
on world politics in the coming years—though it
specifies neither the reasons for nor the manner
PEACEDIPLOMACY.ORG 3 MIDDLE POWERS IN THE MULTIPOLAR WORLD
in which this is to occur.12 It also does not offer a
definition, or a set of criteria, for just what constitutes a ‘middle power’.
As China, Russia, and the other old power centers
of Eurasia rise to challenge U.S. global dominance and possibly also the viability of the liberal
international order that the United States and its
allies have forged since World War II, both opportunities and dangers abound for middle powers
in the emerging multipolar international system.
But what, precisely, a 'middle power’ is remains
speculative. Given the shifting structure of the
international system, it seems more pressing than
ever to form a clear typology for the concept and

"Summarize in bullet points: What do we hope to learn from general theories?
Whether we find general theories of democracy useful or not depends on
what we hope to learn from them. We will not get very much purchase on
individual events. None of the authors whose work is considered below will
help us to assess the likelihood of a military coup in Pakistan or Venezuela
within the next six or 12 months. They might tell us that these countries are
likely to be democratically ruled in 50 years’ time if they achieve reasonable
economic progress in the interim and if the world does not change radically
during this period. This is not, however, very illuminating, and there is no
guarantee that even these conditions will be met. They might tell us that
democratic breakdown in First World countries is unlikely; however, we
are likely to have a good idea that this is so by looking at opinion poll data
telling us that most people in Europe, the USA, Canada and Oceania are
reasonably satisfied with the way their systems operate.
Occasionally, a theorist may produce a finding that surprises us and
turns out to be true. It was prescient of Lipset in the first edition of his
work, which was published in 1959 (second edition 1983), to claim that
democratic breakdown in Europe was unlikely – some people had expressed
fears over the political evolution of 1950s Europe. Vanhanen (1987) helps
explain the failure of Weimar democracy in Germany, by pointing out that
power relationships were rather heavily concentrated within the country at
that time. Although Germany in the aggregate was an advanced industrial
country at that time, there was not the greater diffusion of power resources
within Germany that tends to be found in more materially advanced
countries. Where insights of this kind can be found, they give us an
additional dimension to understand the history of particular cases. Attempts
to find a single big explanation that can cope in its entirety with so large a
topic as democratisation are likely to fail, however.
Theories of this kind provide good mental exercise as well. They establish
intellectual connections – through statistical or historical means – that give
us an extra dimension of understanding when considering particular cases.
They do not provide us with answers. They do help, however, to make our
understanding of particular cases more sophisticated than it otherwise
might be. In general, moreover, a good knowledge of history is helpful to
students of political science."

CBT for psychosis Psychotic disorders are one of the most severe forms of mental-health disturbances. The most debilitating symptoms of this form of mental condition are the difficulty that sufferers experience in staying in touch with reality and their inability to handle any normal daily life activities. Common symptoms are hearing voices or thinking that someone is trying to harm you. Schizophrenia is the most frequent psychotic disorder, and will be the condition that we will learn about here. As with earlier topics, we will start by looking at the clinical features of the disorder – in this case, schizophrenia as described in the DSM-V and ICD-10. Although you are not expected to remember all the clinical features required for a diagnosis, it is important that you have a solid understanding of this condition. As was the case with previous topics, we will encourage you to practise your understanding of the disorders by playing the role of the client or to practise your assessment skills by playing the role of the psychologist in our role-play activities. Diagnosis and classification
Diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia are given in Table 25.2. The marked variability among people diagnosed with schizophrenia in symptomatology, course, treatment response and possible aetiological factors has led to the identification of different subtypes of schizophre- nia. In ICD-10 the main subtypes of schizophrenia are defined in terms of the most prominent symptoms. Distinctions are made between paranoid, hebephrenic and catatonic schizophre- nia (as well as a number of other less clearly defined categories). In paranoid schizophrenia, paranoid delusions, usually accompanied by auditory hallucinations, are the most prominent symptoms. In hebephrenic schizophrenia, diminished or inappropriate affective expression is the predominant symptom, coupled with formal thought disorder or avolition. In catatonic schizophrenia, either retarded or excited catatonic behaviour is the principal feature. Similar distinctions between subtypes of schizophrenia, which date back to Emil Kraepelin’s (1899) seminal work, made in earlier versions of the DSM were dropped in DSM-5. Research has shown that these subtypes are not consistently differentiated by family history, course, prog- nosis or treatment response.
In contrast to the lack of success in validating subtypes of schizophrenia, there has been considerable progress in identifying other conditions on the schizophrenia spectrum which share a similar genetic aetiology and symptom profile (Mamah & Barch, 2011). This approach to classification of schizophrenia-like psychotic disorders is a central organizing principle in DSM-5 and is also implicit in ICD-10. In DSM-5 schizophrenia spectrum disorders include those which have the same symptomatology as schizophrenia, but are of briefer duration (brief psychotic disorder where the disturbance is less than a month and schizophreniform disorder where the disturbance is between 1 and 6 months); those with the same symp- tomatology as schizophrenia in addition to manic or depressive symptoms (schizoaffective disorder); those characterized by a single class of psychotic symptoms (delusional disorder and catatonia); and those characterized by chronic mild schizophrenia-like symptoms (schi- zotypal personality disorder). An attenuated psychosis syndrome for individuals with brief episodes of one or more psychotic symptoms and insight into these is included in DSM-5 as a schizophrenia spectrum condition deserving further study. This condition is typically shown by those at high risk for developing psychosis (Fusar-Poli et al., 2013). In ICD-10 schizophrenia spectrum disorders include schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic dis- orders, schizoaffective disorder, persistent and induced delusional disorders, and schizotypal disorder.
Research on the shared aetiology, symptomatology and treatment response of schizophre- nia spectrum disorders and factor analytic studies of their symptomatology suggests that the distribution of psychotic symptoms within the population more closely approximates dimen- sions rather than disease-like categories. The three principal dimensions are those involving

A. Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated).At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):
1. Delusions.
2. Hallucinations.
3. Disorganized speech (e.g., frequent derailment
or incoherence).
4. Grossly disorganized or catatonic behaviour. 5. Negative symptoms (i.e., diminished emotional
expression or avolition).
B. For a significant portion of the time since the
onset of the disturbance, level of functioning
in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level
of interpersonal, academic, or occupational
functioning).
C. Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for
at least 6 months.This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i.e., active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e.g., odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences).
D. Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently
with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness.
E. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition.
F. If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of child hood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations,
in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated).

ICD-10
A minimum of one very clear symptom (or two or more, if less clear cut) belonging to any one of the groups (a) to (d) or at least two of the symptoms (e) to (h) should have been present most of the time during a period of 1 month or more.
(a) thought echo, thought insertion or withdrawal and thought broadcasting
(b) delusions of control, influence, or passivity, clearly referred to body or limb movements or specific thoughts, actions or sensations; delusional perception
(c) hallucinatory voices giving a running commentary on the patient’s behaviour, or discussing the patient among themselves, or other types of hallucinatory voice coming from some part of the body
(d) persistent delusions of other kinds that are culturally inappropriate and completely impossible, such
as religious or political identity, or superhuman powers and abilities
(e) persistent hallucinations in any modality, when accompanied either by fleeting or half-formed delusions without clear affective content, or by persistent overvalued ideas, or when occurring every day for weeks or months on end
(f) breaks or interpolations in the train of thought, resulting in incoherence or irrelevant speech or neologisms
(g) catatonic behaviour, such as excitement, posturing, or waxy flexibility, negativism, mutism and stupor
(h) negative symptoms such as marked apathy, paucity of speech, and blunting or incongruity of emotional responses, usually resulting in social withdrawal and lowering of social performance

positive symptoms, negative symptoms and disorganization, as described in Table 25.1 (Rietkerk et al., 2008).
The dimensional distribution of psychotic symptoms within the normal population, and the considerable heterogeneity in patterns of symptomatology, course and treatment response among groups of individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or psychosis, has led a sig- nificant group of researchers and service-users to question the validity of defining psycho- sis or schizophrenia as a syndrome, mental illness, disease or disorder. In contrast, hearing voices (hallucinations), holding distinctive beliefs (delusions) and other psychotic symptoms are viewed as discrete experiences, on a continuum with normal experience stemming in part from early trauma and not exclusively due to genetic and neurobiological factors (or ‘brain disease’) (Cook, 2014; Read & Dillon, 2013). This perspective has championed the development of psychological interventions for addressing psychotic experiences, and is aligned with the recovery movement within the mental health field discussed in Chapter 1 (Roe & Davidson, 2008; Slade, 2009). In contrast, the tradition stemming from Kraepelin’s (1899) seminal work and represented in contemporary practice by the syndromal approach in DSM-5 and ICD-10 has played a central role in the development of pharmacological inter- ventions for psychosis to address underlying neurobiological aetiological factors.
Clinical features
A range of clinical features associated with schizophrenia spectrum psychoses have been identified through research and clinical observation (Cook, 2014; Lieberman & Murray, 2012; Mueser & Jeste, 2008; Weinberger & Harrison, 2011). A classification of these in the domains of perception, cognition, emotion, behaviour, social adjustment and somatic state is given in Table 25.3.

Perception
At a perceptual level individuals with schizophrenia spectrum psychoses describe a break- down in perceptual selectivity, with difficulties focusing on essential information or stimuli to the exclusion of accidental details or background noise. Everything seems to be salient and it is difficult to distinguish figure from ground. During an acute psychotic state, inter- nal stimuli such as verbal thoughts are experienced as auditory hallucinations which have the same sensory quality as the spoken word. Auditory hallucinations may be experienced as loud thoughts, as thoughts being repeated by another person aloud (thought echo), as voices speaking inside the head or as voices coming from somewhere in the outer environ- ment. Auditory hallucination may occur as a third-person commentary on the individual’s action, as a voice speaking in the second person directly to the individual, or as two or more people talking or arguing. Individuals may perceive voices to vary along a number of dimensions. Voices may be construed as benign or malevolent, controlling or impotent, all-knowing or knowing little about the person, and the person may feel compelled to do what the voice says or not. Hallucinations that are perceived to be malevolent, controlling, all-knowing and which the individual feels compelled to obey are far more distressing than those which are not construed as having these attributes. As well as varying in the distress they cause, hallucinations may vary in frequency and intensity; the situations or stimuli that trigger their onset (for example threatening events); and the degree to which individuals can suppress them by using coping strategies such as distraction, relaxation or seeking social support. While auditory hallucinations are the most common in schizo- phrenia spectrum disorders, hallucinations may occur in other sensory modalities. Somatic hallucinations often occur in schizophrenia spectrum psychoses, with individuals report- ing feelings of electricity in their body or things crawling under their skin. These may be given delusional interpretations. For example, a service-user reported that the television was activating a transmitter in her pelvis and she could feel the electricity from this causing insects to grow and move around under her skin. Visual hallucinations – seeing visions – are relatively rare in schizophrenia spectrum psychoses, but common in temporal lobe epilepsy.
Cognition
Delusions are the most prominent cognitive clinical features of schizophrenia spectrum psychoses. Delusions are false, idiosyncratic, illogical and stubbornly maintained errone- ous inferences drawn to explain unusual experiences, such as hallucinations. For example, a service-user with auditory hallucinations in which she heard an authoritative voice giving her commands to gather the children to her, inferred that she had been chosen by God to prepare all children for the second coming of Christ. Delusions may arise, not only from hallucinations, but also from unusual feelings associated with psychosis. Persecutory delu- sions may develop from feelings of being watched. Delusions of thought insertion or thought withdrawal may develop as explanations for feelings that thoughts are not one’s own, or that one’s thoughts have suddenly disappeared. Factor analyses show that delusions fall into three broad categories: delusions of influence (including thought withdrawal or insertion, and beliefs about being controlled); delusions of self-significance (including delusions of grandeur or guilt); and delusions of persecution (Vahia & Cohen, 2008). Delusions may vary in the degree of conviction with which they are held (from great certainty to little certainty), the degree to which the person is preoccupied with them (the amount of time spent thinking about the belief), and the amount of distress they cause.

Particular sets of delusions may entail a confused sense of self, particularly paranoid delu- sions where individuals believe that they are being persecuted or punished for misdeeds or delusions of control where there is a belief that one’s actions are controlled by others.
During a psychotic episode there is usually lack of insight and impaired judgement. That is, individuals believe that the content of their hallucinations and delusions are legitimate, and they have difficulty entertaining the idea that these experiences and beliefs arise from a clinical condition or are not believed by others. Between psychotic episodes, insight may improve and service-users may move towards accepting that their hallucination and delu- sions are psychotic symptoms.
The speech of clients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders is difficult to understand because of abnormalities in the underlying form of thought. Formal thought disorder is characterized by tangentiality, derailment, incoherence, thought blocking, loss of goal and neologisms. With tangentiality, answers given to questions are off the point. With derailment, sentences make sense, but little meaning is conveyed by sequences of sentences because there is a constant jumping from one topic to another with only very loose associations between topics and little logic to what is said. With incoherence, sentences are incorrectly formed so they do not make sense. With thought blocking, the person abruptly stops in mid- sentence and is unable complete their train of thought. With loss of goal, there is a difficulty in following a logical train of thought from A to B. With neologisms, new words are made up that have an idiosyncratic meaning for the patient.
Cognitive impairment or deterioration occurs in schizophrenia. This may be either general or specific. With general cognitive deterioration, there is a reduction in overall IQ with many cognitive functions negatively affected. With specific cognitive impairment one or more of the following functions may be impaired: attention, memory, cognitive flexibility, social cog- nition and executive function, particularly the capacity to follow through on a planned course of action. Cognitive impairment is a better predictor of disability and vocational functioning than positive symptoms.
Emotions
At an emotional level, during the prodromal phase, before an acute psychotic episode, anx- iety or depression may occur in response to initial changes in perceptual selectivity and cognitive inefficiency. A key part of relapse prevention is for service-users to learn how to identify and manage prodromal changes in affect. During acute psychotic episodes, anxiety or depression may occur in response to hallucinations, delusions, formal thought disorder and other distressing symptoms. A disturbance of affect is the hallmark of hebephrenic schiz- ophrenia. With inappropriate affect the individual responds not to the external social con- text but to internal stimuli such as auditory hallucinations, for example by laughing wildly. Diminished expression of emotions, also referred to as flattened or blunted affect may occur, particularly in chronic cases. During remission following an episode of psychosis, the sense of loss that comes with increased insight into the problems entailed by psychosis may give rise to post-psychotic depression.
Behaviour
At a behavioural level, prodromal excitation may occur prior to an acute psychotic episode. This may be characterized by sleep disturbance, impulsive behaviour, and overactivity which may include compulsive behaviour. During acute psychotic episodes, avolition occurs with

impairment of goal-directed behaviour. In chronic cases catatonic behaviour may occur with impairment in the capacity to initiate and organize voluntary movement and posture. Cata- tonia may be either retarded or excited. Excessive purposeless motor activity is the hallmark of excited catatonia and may include stereotypies (repetitive actions), echolalia (repeating words said by others) or echopraxia (imitating the actions of others). With retarded cata- tonic behaviour there is a marked reduction in purposeful activity. Individuals may show immobility, mutism, adopt unusual postures for long periods of time and display waxy flex- ibility (allowing one’s limbs to be manipulated like a warm candle) or negativism (resisting attempts to have one’s limbs moved).
Social adjustment
In schizophrenia spectrum disorders there is a marked functional impairment and deteri- oration in social adjustment. The capacity for self-care, dressing appropriately, grooming and personal hygiene deteriorates, so that people with psychosis often look dishevelled and unkempt. A significant decline in performance in educational and work settings occurs. There is a withdrawal from regular socializing with friends and difficulty making and main- taining new relationships. A deterioration in relationships with family members also occurs. Psychosis has a negative impact on parent–child and sibling relationships.
Somatic state
About half of all people with schizophrenia have comorbid substance use disorders and almost three-quarters have significant health problems. The most common health problems include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is usually due to smoking; heart disease and diabetes due to obesity; and HIV/AIDS and hepatitis B and C due to unsafe sex and intravenous drug use. The substance use and medical problems so common in schiz- ophrenia are essentially lifestyle problems. On the positive side, schizophrenia is associated with reduced rates of cancer and rheumatoid arthritis (Tandon et al., 2008a).
We encourage an inquisitive approach to the study of our topics. You will therefore be required to explore the prevalence of psychotic disorders in your own country. Is there a difference in comparison with the situation in other countries, and, if so, what could be the reason for this? 

We will next look at the aetiology of psychotic disorders: that is, why does a person develop a psychotic disorder? The answer is never clear and is often a combination of many factors. There are biological and psychological theories about psychosis which can provide a thorough explanation of the development of this mental health condition. You will be required to learn about these theories and produce a poster summarising your findings. Sharing your knowledge with other colleagues and learning from their posters is a very effective form of learning. 

We will end this topic by exploring the most prevalent therapeutical approaches for dealing with psychotic disorders. Although medications are often essential, psychological therapies also have an important positive impact on the functioning of a person with psychosis. Role-play activities will again be encouraged to practise specific therapeutical interventions with a client presenting with psychosis. Assessment
Risk assessment and management
In the management of cases of suspected or confirmed psychosis, the first priority is to assess risk of self-harm or harm to others, since prodromal impulsivity may lead to danger- ous behaviour (Dutta & Harkavy-Friedman, 2012; Volavka et al., 2012). Risk of self-harm may be managed following the guidelines in Chapter 11. Violent behaviour requires care- ful assessment and management following guidelines given in Volavka et al. (2012) and Haddock (2013). The frequency, intensity and targets for violent behaviour, environmental triggers for violence, auditory hallucinations and paranoid delusional beliefs that may trig- ger violence, drug and alcohol use associated with violent behaviour, and non-adherence to medication regimes as a potential contributing factor to aggression all require careful assess- ment. This assessment may be used as a basis for formulating key factors precipitating and maintaining violence. A multimodal approach involving psychological and pharmacological interventions may be taken to the acute management of violent episodes in service-users with psychotic symptoms. Psychological interventions aim to distance service-users from environmental factors that trigger violence (persons, places, situations, street drugs and alco- hol, etc.) by offering them a quiet room in which to talk about their needs and concerns to a skilled clinician, while making it clear that there are other staff available to support the clinician should the service-user become violent during the interview. Intramuscular benzo- diazepines and antipsychotic medications are the main pharmacological interventions used for the acute management of violence.
Diagnostic assessment
The next priority is to clarify symptomatology. Careful interviewing using the diagnostic cri- teria set out in Table 25.2, and the SCID-5, CAARMS or SIPS and SOPS listed in Table 25.7 may be used. Standardized rating scales may also be useful in assessing symptom severity and making a diagnosis. Rating scales for the full constellation of psychotic symptomatol- ogy and for specific symptoms are listed in Table 25.7. Careful observation and a series of interviews with multiple informants over a number of sessions will typically be necessary to assess symptomatology. Multidisciplinary involvement is particularly important in cases where service-users present with psychotic features. From the earliest stages in these cases, teamwork between clinical psychology and psychiatry is recommended.
Differential diagnosis
When making a differential diagnosis, it is useful to first determine if psychotic symptoms listed in Table 25.1 are present. Next, consider symptom severity. Service-users showing chronic eccentricities which fall just short of positive symptoms and thought disorder may meet the criteria for schizotypal personality disorder. Then consider if the symptoms consti- tute a single symptom diagnosis (e.g. delusional disorder or catatonia). Next, consider if the symptoms are time-limited (e.g. attenuated or at-risk psychotic syndrome, brief psychotic disorder or schizophreniform disorder). If the individual has insight into their symptoms and they occur very briefly, this indicates the presence of an attenuated or at-risk psychotic syndrome. Then consider affective symptoms. For schizoaffective disorder the criteria for schizophrenia must be met, and also those for a manic or depressive episode (described in Chapter 10). Depressive or bipolar disorders with psychotic features may be distinguished

from schizophrenia spectrum disorders by taking account of the content of delusions and hallucinations, which are usually mood congruent in affective disorders. In depression the delusions and hallucinations have depressive content, whereas in mania they have grandiose content. Also, the onset of schizophrenia tends to be insidious, whereas the onset of major depression with psychotic features tends to be acute. To rule out transient psychoses arising from the use of hallucinogenic drugs such as ecstasy or LSD, extended periods of observa- tion and a referral for toxicological tests is appropriate. Referral for an EEG can rule out temporal lobe epilepsy as a cause of hallucinations, although in a small proportion of cases comorbid schizophrenia and seizure disorder occurs. Usually hallucinations associated with temporal lobe epilepsy are visual, whereas those associated with schizophrenia spectrum disorders are auditory. Referral for a thorough medical assessment is appropriate to rule out possible organic factors as the source of psychotic symptoms.
History and key predisposing, precipitating, maintaining and protective factors
Potential predisposing, precipitating, maintaining and protective factors should be assessed by thorough interviewing following the format in Chapter 8. Important predisposing factors include a family history of psychosis and a personal history of trauma, abuse, bullying, stress or adversity, and associated neurobiological and psychological factors. Psychotic episodes may be precipitated by a build-up of life stresses or hallucinogenic drug use, for example cannabis or LSD.
Psychotic symptoms may be maintained by the way in which service-users cope with trauma, stress and anomalous experiences; by their attributions and beliefs concerning these experiences; and by their lifestyle habits, for example their substance use, lack of structure, social isolation and living in a stressful environment. Cognitive impairment may also main- tain psychotic symptoms and impede recovery. Psychotic symptoms may also be maintained by the ways in which significant other people in service-users’ lives interact with them. High levels of negative critical interactions or overinvolved interactions may be stressful and so maintain psychotic symptoms. Low adherence to pharmacological and psychological treat- ment regimes, a poor alliance with service providers, lack of coordination among multidisci- plinary or multi-agency service providers can maintain psychotic symptoms.
Important protective factors include good premorbid functioning, an acute onset, a clear precipitant and awareness or insight into prodromal symptoms. A better outcome occurs where there is low stress and a good social support network at home, with friends and at work. Females rather than males have a better outcome. Where there are additional affective features or a family history of affective disorders rather than schizophrenia spectrum disorders there is a better prognosis. Within the treatment system, cooperative working relationships between the treatment team and the service-user and good coordination of multi-professional input are protective factors. Treatment systems that are sensitive to the cultural and ethnic beliefs and values of service-users are more likely to help them engage with and remain in treatment.
Instruments for assessing service need and the extent to which service-users’ environ- ments support recovery, listed in Table 25.7, may also be incorporated into assessment to aid treatment planning."

"Please out yourself into the role of a project manager and summarise this easily and in bullet points to a student who is learning to make a project: Information Architecture
The second layer from the bottom in the UX design iceberg is information architecture, or IA for short. IA is the design discipline responsible for defining how the information and functionality of a software product should be structured. Products typically consist of multiple pages or screens, and there are numerous ways to organize them. The customer accesses the various parts of the product by using the product's navigation system. When looking for a certain page, the customer relies on the navigation labels to infer how the product is organized and guess where the desired page is located. Card sorting is a research technique used to learn how customers think about the different parts of the product and how they are related in order to identify their preferred organization scheme. Good IA organizes a product in a manner that users find intuitive, with labels that are easy to understand, resulting in good usability and findability.
Findability refers to how easy it is for users to find what they're looking for in the product. To measure this attribute, you could ask a group of test users to try to find a certain page or screen in your product and see what percentage are successful. You can also assess findability by looking at navigation patterns from an analytics tool. Are your users taking the shortest path to get to each page? Or are they getting lost and taking longer paths or hitting the browser's back button?
Note that IA deals with the product's feature set at a high level: what the features are, how they should be organized, and how they should be labeled. At this point, you are not yet thinking about user flows, page layout, or look and feel. Information architecture is a foundational layer that contributes to a great UX by making the product's structure feel intuitive to users. The main IA deliverable used to do that is the sitemap.
Sitemaps
A sitemap is used to define a product's structure. Even though the term “sitemap” comes from “site” (as in “website”), it's the name of the design deliverable used to specify structure for any software product, including mobile apps. A sitemap shows all of the pages or screens, how they are organized into sections, and the high-level navigation patterns provided. A sitemap also specifies page titles and the words used to label sections of the product. You should test your sitemap with users to ensure that your labels convey the intended meaning and that, when asked to find pages or screens pertaining to different features, they are able to easily do so with your proposed structure. Figure 8.2 is an example sitemap for a web application that enables video advertising campaigns.
Figure 8.2 Sitemap Example
Each box in this sitemap represents a page. Lines connect the boxes to show navigation paths between pages. In a few cases, the navigation is one-way, indicated with an arrow (refer to the legend on the left side). The global navigation items—pages to which the user can navigate from any page—are clearly identified. The global navigation shows the major sections of the product, which correspond to the main links you would see at the top of a website. The sitemap indicates which page users navigate to when they click on each of those top-level links. For each section of the website, its subpages are shown in a clear hierarchical format. The sitemap also shows which pages behave differently from normal—by either opening in a popup or opening in a new browser tab.
Once you have created a sitemap that defines your product pages and how they are organized, the next step is to identify how the user experience flows across those pages—that is, how the user will interact with the product."

 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND POLITICAL LEGITIMACY'
 SEYMOUR MARTIN LIPSET
 University of California, Berkeley
 The conditions associated with the existence and stability of democratic
 society have been a leading concern of political philosophy. In this paper the
 problem is attacked from a sociological and behavioral standpoint, by present-
 ing a number of hypotheses concerning some social requisites for democracy,
 and by discussing some of the data available to test these hypotheses. In its
 concern with conditions-values, social institutions, historical events-external
 to the political system itself which sustain different general types of political
 systems, the paper moves outside the generally recognized province of political
 sociology. This growing field has dealt largely with the internal analysis of or-
 ganizations with political goals, or with the determinants of action within vari-
 ous political institutions, such as parties, government agencies, or the electoral
 process.2 It has in the main left to the political philosopher the larger concern
 with the relations of the total political system to society as a whole.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 A sociological analysis of any pattern of behavior, whether referring to a
 small or a large social system, must result in specific hypotheses, empirically
 testable statements. Thus, in dealing with democracy, one must be able to
 point to a set of conditions that have actually existed in a number of countries,
 and say: democracy has emerged out of these conditions, and has become stabil-
 ized because of certain supporting institutions and values, as well as because of
 its own internal self-maintaining processes. The conditions listed must be ones
 which differentiate most democratic states from most others.
 A recent discussion by a group of political theorists on the ""cultural pre-
 requisites to a successfully functioning democracy"" points up the difference
 between the approach of the political sociologist and the political philosopher
 to a comparable problem.' A considerable portion of this symposium is devoted

 70 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
 to a debate concerning the contribution of religion, particularly Christian
 ethics, toward democratic attitudes. The principal author, Ernest Griffith, sees
 a necessary connection between the Judeo-Christian heritage and attitudes
 which sustain democratic institutions; the other participants stress the political
 and economic conditions which may provide the basis for a consensus on basic
 values which does not depend on religion; and they point to the depression,
 poverty, and social disorganization which resulted in fascism in Italy and
 Germany, in spite of strongly religious populations and traditions. What is
 most striking about this discussion is its lack of a perspective which assumes
 that theoretical propositions must be subject to test by a systematic compari-
 son of all available cases, and which treats a deviant case properly as one case
 out of many. In this symposium, on the contrary, deviant cases which do not
 fit a given proposition are cited to demonstrate that there are no social condi-
 tions which are regularly associated with a given complex political system. So
 the conflicts among political philosophers about the necessary conditions under-
 lying given political systems often lead to a triumphant demonstration that a
 given situation clearly violates the thesis of one's opponent, much as if the ex-
 istence of some wealthy socialists, or poor conservatives, demonstrated that
 economic factors were not an important determinant of political preference.
 The advantage of an attempt such as is presented here, which seeks to dis-
 sect the conditions of democracy into several interrelated variables, is that
 deviant cases fall into proper perspective. The statistical preponderance of
 evidence supporting the relationship of a variable such as education to democ-
 racy indicates that the existence of deviant cases (such as Germany, which suc-
 cumbed to dictatorship in spite of an advanced educational system) cannot
 be the sole basis for rejecting the hypothesis. A deviant case, considered within
 a context which marshals the evidence on all relevant cases, often may actually
 strengthen the basic hypothesis if an intensive study of it reveals the special
 conditions which prevented the usual relationship from appearing.4 Thus, elec-
 toral research indicates that a large proportion of the more economically well-
 to-do leftists are underprivileged along other dimensions of social status, such
 as ethnic or religious position.
 Controversy in this area stems not only from variations in methodology,
 but also from use of different definitions. Clearly in order to discuss democracy,
 or any other phenomenon, it is first necessary to define it. For the purposes of
 4 A detailed example of how a deviant case and analysis advances theory may be found
 in S. M. Lipset, M. Trow, and J. Coleman, Union Democracy, (Glencoe: The Free Press,
 1956). This book is a study of the political process inside the International Typographical
 Union, which has a long-term two-party system with free elections and frequent turn-
 over in office, and is thus the clearest exception to Robert Michels' ""iron law of oligarchy.""
 The research, however, was not intended as a report on this union, but rather as the best
 means available to test and amplify Michels' ""law."" The study could only have been
 made through a systematic effort to establish a basic theory and derive hypotheses. The
 best way to add to knowledge about the internal government of voluntary associations
 seemed to be to study the most deviant case. In the process of examining the particular
 historical and structural conditions sustaining the two-party system in the ITU, the gen-
 eral theory was clarified.

 SOME SOCIAL REQUISITES OF DEMOCRACY 71
 this paper, democracy (in a complex society) is defined as a political system
 which supplies regular constitutional opportunities for changing the governing
 officials. It is a social mechanism for the resolution of the problem of societal
 decision-making among conflicting interest groups which permits the largest
 possible part of the population to influence these decisions through their ability
 to choose among alternative contenders for political office. In large measure
 abstracted from the work of Joseph Schumpeter and Max Weber,5 this defini-
 tion implies a number of specific conditions: (a) a ""political formula,"" a system
 of beliefs, legitimizing the democratic system and specifying the institutions-
 parties, a free press, and so forth-which are legitimized, i.e., accepted as
 proper by all; (b) one set of political leaders in office; and (c) one or more sets
 of leaders, out of office, who act as a legitimate opposition attempting to gain
 office.
 The need for these conditions is clear. First, if a political system is not char-
 acterized by a value system allowing the peaceful ""play"" of power-the adher-
 ence by the ""outs"" to decisions made by ""ins"" and the recognition by ""ins"" of
 the rights of the ""outs""-there can be no stable democracy. This has been
 the problem faced by many Latin American states. Second, if the outcome of the
 political game is not the periodic awarding of effective authority to one group,
 a party or stable coalition, then unstable and irresponsible government rather
 than democracy will result. This state of affairs existed in pre-Fascist Italy,
 and for much, though not all of the history of the Third and Fourth French
 Republics, which were characterized by weak coalition governments, often
 formed among parties which had major interest and value conflicts with each
 other. Third, if the conditions facilitating the perpetuation of an effective op-
 position do not exist, then the authority of officials will be maximized, and
 popular influence on policy will be at a minimum. This is the situation in all
 one-party states; and by general agreement, at least in the West, these are
 dictatorships.
 Two principal complex characteristics of social systems will be considered
 here as they bear on the problem of stable democracy: economic development
 and legitimacy. These will be presented as structural characteristics of a so-
 ciety which sustain a democratic political system. After a discussion of the
 economic development complex (comprising industrialization, wealth, urbani-
 zation, and education) and its consequences for democracy, we shall move to
 two aspects of the problem of legitimacy, or the degree to which institutions are
 valued for themselves, and considered right and proper. The relations between
 legitimacy and the effectiveness of the system (the latter primarily a function
 of economic development) will be followed by a discussion of the sources of
 cleavage in a society and the ways in which various resolutions of historically
 crucial issues result either in disruptive forms of cleavage or in cross-cutting
 affiliations which reduce conflict to a manageable level. Finally, the bearing of
 these various factors upon the future of democracy will be assessed.

 72 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
 No detailed examination of the political history of individual countries will
 be undertaken in accordance with the generic definition, since the relative de-
 gree or social content of democracy in different countries is not the real prob-
 lem of this paper. Certain problems of method in the handling of relationships
 between complex characteristics of total societies do merit brief discussion,
 however.
 An extremely high correlation between aspects of social structure, such as
 income, education, religion, on the one hand, and democracy, on the other, is
 not to be anticipated even on theoretical grounds, because to the extent that
 the political sub-system of the society operates autonomously, a particular
 political form may persist under conditions normally adverse to the emergence
 of that form. Or, a political form may develop because of a syndrome of fairly
 unique historical factors, even though major social characteristics favor another
 form. Germany is an example of a nation in which the structural changes-
 growing industralization, urbanization, wealth, and education-all favored the
 establishment of a democratic system, but in which a series of adverse historical
 events prevented democracy from securing legitimacy in the eyes of many
 important segments of society, and thus weakened German democracy's abil-
 ity to withstand crisis.
 The high correlations which appear in the data to be presented between
 democracy and other institutional characteristics of societies must not be
 overly stressed, since unique events may account for either the persistence or
 the failure of democracy in any particular society. Max Weber argued strongly
 that differences in national patterns often reflect key historical events which
 set one process in motion in one country, and a second process in another. To
 illustrate his point, he used the analogy of a dice game in which each time the
 dice came up with a certain number they were increasingly loaded in the direc-
 tion of coming up with that number again.6 To Weber, an event predisposing
 a country toward democracy sets a process in motion which increases the likeli-
 hood that at the next critical point in the country's history democracy will win
 out again. This process can only have meaning if we assume that once estab-
 lished, a democratic political system gathers some momentum, and creates
 some social supports (institutions) to ensure its continued existence. Thus a
 ""premature"" democracy which survives will do so by (among other things)
 facilitating the growth of other conditions conducive to democracy, such as
 universal literacy, or autonomous private associations. This paper is primarily
 concerned with explicating the social conditions which serve to support a demo-
 cratic political system, such as education or legitimacy; it will not deal in detail
 with the kinds of internal mechanisms which serve to maintain democratic sys-
 tems such as the specific rules of the political game.'

 SOME SOCIAL REQUISITES OF DEMOCRACY 73
 Comparative generalizations dealing with complex social systems must neces-
 sarily deal rather summarily with particular historical features of any one
 society within the scope of the investigation. In order to test these generaliza-
 tions bearing on the differences between countries which rank high or low in
 possession of the attributes associated with democracy, it is necessary to estab-
 lish some empirical measures of the type of political system. Individual devi-
 ations from a particular aspect of democracy are not too important, as long as
 the definitions unambiguously cover the great majority of nations which are
 located as democratic or undemocratic. The precise dividing line between
 ""more democratic"" and ""less democratic"" is also not a basic problem, since
 presumably democracy is not a quality of a social system which either does or
 does not exist, but is rather a complex of characteristics which may be ranked
 in many different ways. For this reason it was decided to divide the countries
 under consideration into two groups, rather than to attempt to rank them from
 highest to lowest. Ranking individual countries from the most to the least
 democratic is much more difficult than splitting the countries into two classes,
 ""more"" or ""less"" democratic, although even here borderline cases such as
 Mexico pose problems.
 Efforts to classify all countries raise a number of problems. Most countries
 which lack an enduring tradition of political democracy lie in the traditionally
 underdeveloped sections of the world. It is possible that Max Weber was right
 when he suggested that modern democracy in its clearest forms can only occur
 under the unique conditions of capitalist industrialization.8 Some of the com-
 plications introduced by the sharp variations in political practices in different
 parts of the earth can be reduced by dealing with differences among countries
 within political culture areas. The two best areas for such internal comparison
 are Latin America as one, and Europe and the English-speaking countries as
 the other. More limited comparisons may be made among the Asian states, and
 among the Arab countries.
 The main criteria used in this paper to locate European democracies are the
 uninterrupted continuation of political democracy since World War I, and the
 absence over the past 25 years of a major political movement opposed to the
 democratic ""rules of the game.""9 The somewhat less stringent criterion em-
 ployed for Latin America is whether a given country has had a history of more

 Democratic Theory, (University of Chicago, 1956), esp. pp. 90-123, for recent systematic
 efforts to specify some of the internal mechanisms of democracy. See David Easton, ""An
 Approach to the Analysis of Political Systems,"" World Politics, Vol. 9 (1957), pp. 383-
 400, for discussion of problems of internal analysis of political systems.

 9 The latter requirement means that no totalitarian movement, either Fascist or Com-
 munist, received 20 per cent of the vote during this time. Actually all the European na-
 tions falling on the democratic side of the continuum had totalitarian movements which
 secured less than seven per cent of the vote.

 or less free elections for most of the post-World War I period. Where in Europe
 we look for stable democracies, in South America we look for countries which
 have not had fairly constant dictatorial rule (See Table I). No detailed analysis
 of the political history of either Europe or Latin America has been made with
 an eye toward more specific criteria of differentiation; at this point in the ex-
 amination of the requisites of democracy, election results are sufficient to locate
 the European countries, and the judgments of experts and impressionistic
 assessments based on fairly well-known facts of political history will suffice for
 Latin America.'0

"Summarize the following texts in bullet points. Do not include any information that is not in the original text. I need a detailed summary. In the conclusion, we first offer some thoughts addressing the main question posed
in this volume: the absence of a non-Western IRT and possible explanations behind
it. We then reflect on whether the question of a non-Western IRT is a meaningful one, and whether the way it is approached in this collection could result in a
productive debate that would advance the discipline of IR. Although our empirical focus is on Asia, we suggest some insights that have more general relevance
for non-Western IRT. To this end, we incorporate and compare insights from the
Islamic world and reflections on the importance of world historical perspectives
in advancing the prospects for non-Western IRT.
Why the absence of non-Western IRT?
The question why there is no non-Western IRT required us to look at a number of
areas. First, what is meant by international relations theory in the different countries
and regions? Second, what is the extent of Western dominance in these areas: are
some countries under more such dominance than others? A related issue was to
ascertain where there were Western-inspired theories which are more popular in a
given country than in another. A third question is to compare the main non-Western
sources of IRT following our four-fold source matrix: classical ideas, the thinking
of modern leaders and elites, attempts by IR scholars to apply Western theory to
the local context (looking outside-in) and similar attempts by scholars to generalize from the local experience for an wider audience, but on its own terms (looking
inside-out). In this section, we offer some generalizations about the reasons for the
absence of non-Western IRT, in accordance with our five hypotheses:
 1. Western IRT has discovered the right path to understanding IR.
 2. Western IRT has acquired hegemonic status in the Gramscian sense.
 3. Non-Western IR theories do exist, but are hidden.
 4. Local conditions discriminate against the production of IR theory.
 5. The West has a big head start, and what we are seeing is a period of catching up.
Perhaps the first point to make is that our driving question seems to be justified.
There is not much current IRT to be found in Asia, even when using the broad
222 A. Acharya and B. Buzan
definitions of IR and theory set out in our introduction. There is an abundance of
pre-theoretical resources, but not all that much has been made of them and in some
cases they have been largely forgotten or marginalized. We find Western dominance to be a uniform factor in all cases; although it is difficult to rank countries or
subregions in this way (South Korea does, however, seem to be an extreme case,
where ‘most IR theories have been imported from the West, especially the US’
(Chun, Chapter 4). The real distinction seems to be degree of interest in theoretical work per se, or the distinction between theoretical and atheoretical work. It is
reasonable to assume that a great deal of work on international relations in Asia
falls into the latter category, although this is changing, as economic and institutional conditions in Asian countries develop. This, however, does not automatically
translate into great appeal and room for non-Western IRT; indeed, the reverse may
be the case. Scholars are more likely to turn to Western IRT first before they discover the possibility and sources of non-Western IRT. So it is reasonable to look
to our five causal hypotheses to see what the case studies reveal.
There is no suggestion in any of the chapters that Western IRT is unchallengeable because it has found the right path to understanding IR. Again, Korea comes
close to invalidating our hypothesis; here Western IR theories, ‘especially realism
and security studies … have been very helpful in explaining the reality of Korean
international relations’ (Chun, Chapter 4). But generally, IRT does not have the
same standing as the natural sciences developed in the West. For them, their
weight of authority broadly derives from an acceptance of method, agreement on
epistemology and acceptance of the knowledge produced as either true, or able to
deliver on explanations and predictions, or at least as the best approach available.
At least some of the dissatisfaction and/or disinterest in IRT in Asia arises from the
perception that Western IRT does not adequately capture the needs and conditions
to be found in Asia. We sense growing realization and dissatisfaction about the lack
of fit between Western IRT and the local milieu, and this in turn suggests a clear
link to the arguments of Badie (1992) about the highly imperfect way in which the
Western state system was imposed on the Third World. Moreover, there is a realization that the narrowness of Western IRT contributes to the marginalization not
just of Asian scholars, but also of their countries. Interestingly, one manifestation
of this is a sense of ‘alienation’ (Acharya 2000), evident in the lack of interest in
IRT in Asia. Arguably, this is part of the explanation for the atheoretical nature
of work on international relations pertaining to Asia, because of the widespread
view that IRT as it stands now has very limited applicability to Asia. Whether
this is a matter of perception or reality can be debated, and to some extent, this is
certainly a matter of perception (and a perfect excuse for not doing the hard work
of mastering the IRT literature, especially in classrooms). But it is also a genuine
concern in all the countries studied. The sense that IRT, not only as employed by
Western scholars in their study of Asia, but also as used by local scholars in studying their home country, contributes to the marginalization of local scholarship and
the country itself is perhaps more acute in India, although a similar sense is evident
in South Korea, Southeast Asia and China.
The case studies suggest that a much more powerful explanation for why there
Conclusion 223
is no non-Western IRT in Asia is the hegemonic standing of Western IRT. Indeed,
with the possible exception of China, this hegemony means that the expanding
discipline of IR in Asia may generate more and not less Western dominance.
The exception in China is qualified however, because of the peculiar dominance,
at least in terms of the four cases studied here, of Marxist and Maoist ideology
and worldview. But once China began its process of reform and opened up to the
world, its IR community almost naturally and quickly turned to Western theories
and texts. It is only when the Chinese became increasingly aware and convinced of
their emerging and ‘unstoppable’ status as a world power that they started looking
to the possibility of a Chinese IRT, or at least at IRT with ‘Chinese characteristics’.
This may suggest the link between power and ideas applies as much to China as
to the West, although we do not foresee a Chinese dominance of Asian IRT, in the
way Western IRT has shaped global IRT. Apart from the fact, as will be seen later,
that national approaches to the development of IRT (including IRT in China, as
Qin’s essay shows) remain important, Chinese ideational dominance in East Asia,
past and future, can be overstated, especially by those who imagine Asia’s return
to the benign power configurations of a tributary system (Kang 2003; Acharya
2004). More on the link between power and IRT later, except for an observation
that in Southeast Asia, which has no aspiration to great power status, and where
IRT has had less appeal (or where writings on IR tend to be more atheoretical
than in Northeast Asia), there too is a growing realization among the academic
community that Western IRT inadequately captures regional dynamics that centre
around efforts by a group of weaker states to construct a regional order binding
the great powers of the current international system. This challenges the top-down
conception of both power politics and multilateralism that has dominated Western
IRT. Moreover, this disjuncture between the power bias of Western IRT and the
regional dynamics of Southeast Asia cannot be appreciated by the ‘modernization’
perspective, which, as Alan Chong’s essay shows, is commonly found in post-war
theoretical framings of Southeast Asia’s politics and international relations.
The conjecture that non-Western theories exist but are hidden from the public
eye (in this case the global community of IR scholars) is only marginally relevant
to our overall question. Unless they are very well hidden indeed, even from the eyes
of the locally based case-study authors, it is not the case that an undiscovered horde
of IR theoretical riches lies unrecognized in Asia. Language is no doubt a barrier,
as much within Asia as between it and the West. The experience of Europe, where
IR discourses in French and German (and to a lesser extent other languages) is not
well integrated with the English-language mainstream (Friedrichs 2004), suggests
the language barrier problem will be difficult to overcome. Since in Asia, as in
Europe, there is no local lingua franca, English is the most likely language to serve
as common ground, but also one that reinforces Western hegemony. IRT-relevant
material could also still lurk in places where the hegemonic form of IRT would
not suggest that one look. But we suspect that while there are no doubt significant
cultural barriers to entry from outside into the Western IR discourse, most of what
is hidden is pre-theoretical resources rather than fully fledged ‘Asian’ conceptions
of international relations.
224 A. Acharya and B. Buzan
Our fourth hypothesis about local conditions discriminating against the development of IRT also seems powerful, though very varied in form from place to place.
The paucity of institutions, journals, research cultures, career incentives, research
resources and training facilities is especially acute in Southeast Asia (other than
Singapore), and is also a major problem in India. It would have been true of China
until recently, but now the institutional side of IR is developing rapidly there. The
impact of how IR came to develop in particular countries is also influential, particularly in terms of what discipline (e.g. political science, history, law, sociology, area
studies) acted as the carrier for IR. Japan offers a quite different take on local conditions, where there is an IR discourse, but it is quite inward-looking. The impact of
local conditions extends to the economic predicament of IR scholars, which often
leads them to the path of policy-oriented research and writing. Indonesia offers a
particularly stark example. Here, IR scholars not just shun theoretical studies for
policy work or media appearances, but also enter politics.
The evidence from the Islamic Middle East only adds weight to our foregoing
observations about why is there no non-Western IRT. Here too one finds the apparently paradoxical situation in which no one seems to think Western IRT has found
the right path, yet it has acquired hegemonic status. But unlike the Chinese case, the
Islamic world, weak and divided as it is, cannot yet imagine overcoming this hegemony. One exception to the general observation that local conditions discriminate
against the development of non-Western IRT is where local responses to external
challenges prompt conceptual innovation and ideational shifts. Examples of this
can be found in the codification of relations between Muslims and non-Muslims at
the time of the Muslim conquests, and the revival and reinterpretation of classical
sources that has been prompted by globalization.
The fifth hypothesis that the West has a head start is also powerful. Perhaps
the main test here will be the challenge hypothesized in the China paper about the
imminent rise of a ‘Chinese school’ of IR. Playing catch-up does not and need not
mean that Asia is in a mere copying mode, whether it comes to developing theories
of international relations or practices from which such theories can be derived.
Copying may be part of the process, especially in its early phases, but there is room
for divergent development. More on this in the next section.
One final point here concerns our assertion at the very outset that there is a growing recognition and dissatisfaction over the relevance of existing IRTs in capturing
and explaining the experience of the non-Western states and societies. Although
this is no longer debatable, at least in terms of the findings of this project, there
are differences on this question among the various IR theories. To be sure, this
is not a project about the relative merits of realism, liberalism, constructivism or
analytic eclecticism (Katzenstein and Okawara 2001), but there are some insights
of interest to those interested in the so-called great debates in IRT. No evidence
emerges of the demise of realism. Even though constructivism has not replaced
realism, there is evidence that it is increasingly being perceived as more relevant
to theorizing non-Western realities and practices. In the case of Islam, there is a
clear argument about constructivism’s fit, especially in capturing the role of religion, culture and identity that are critical to developing theoretical discourses and
Conclusion 225
concepts from Islamic states and societies (Tadjbakhsh, Chapter 8). And for all
the seeming incompatibility between Chinese and Western IR thought, it is still
possible to find parallels between the two. Thus, the Confucian way of governance, consisting of five core relationships (father-son, emperor-minister, elder
brother-younger brother, husband-wife, friend-friend) and of four social bonds
(propriety, righteousness, honesty, a sense of shame) can be likened to the ‘logic
of appropriateness’ (Qin, Chapter 2). In the case of Japan, the contributions of
Nishida, Tabata and Hirano could be used to identify what Inoguchi (Chapter 3)
calls a ‘constructivist theory with Japanese characteristics’. In the case of South
Korea, although concepts such as the ‘balance of power system and security competition, theories about balance of power, hegemony, security dilemma and power
transition have been especially helpful’, in explaining its security environment and
behaviour, Chun still finds an important role for constructivism when it comes to
explaining the conflict with North Korea, where questions about ‘multiple identities, overlapping identities and multiple organizing principles’ that are germane to
constructivism assume special significance. Similarly, the case of Indonesia attests
to the relevance if not of constructivism exclusively on its own terms, then at least
of constructivism as part of an analytic eclecticism, whereby social constructivist
variables like identity, symbols, values, institutions and norms are seen to inform
and condition ‘culturally motivated realpolitik practice’ (Sebastian and Lanti,
Chapter 7)."

both aspects of the question and link these together. You may want to focus on a
couple sociocultural factors (e.g. culture, socioeconomic status) and their resulting
influence on ONE health behaviour (e.g. diet, healthcare utilisation). Lastly, you
should consider how the evidence you present may shape public health
interventions (e.g. targeting specific high-risk groups).
This is to allow you to discuss these in sufficient depth and through a critical lens,
given the strict word limit of this piece of writing.
Please structure your essay so that you have an introduction, main body and
conclusion. Remember to be critical in your discussion, as being able to understand
and think critically are key skills to acquire during your degree and so are assessed by

can you make notes: • Mixed Methods 
• qualitative analysis 
quantitative analysis Welcome to Topic 7 of the Research design and statistics 2B module. In this topic we move away from our focus on statistics, specifically multivariate statistics, and we start to consider a more holistic, combined research method which integrates both quantitative and qualitative approaches. Known as the Mixed Methods approach, within quantitative-focused research, it often occurs on an unofficial level – that is, it is quite common to have a discussion with the participants once the research has finished. Such a discussion is often focused on the participants’ experience and their thoughts on the experiment they have just completed for you. These discussions can often be incredibly insightful, especially at the start of data collection when the experiment is new. They can provide a clear expectation and explanation for the researcher in terms of why their data may eventually end up following a certain pattern. However, due to the unofficial nature of such discussions, their content cannot be included in any analysis related to the experiment and thus the knowledge gained is lost.  

Similarly, experiments with a qualitative focus can provide us with a great insight into human thought through the analysis of interview transcripts and so on. But often the conclusions we draw can be restricted by the lack of quantitative statistical evidence that could support them.  

Based on this, hopefully it is clear that by incorporating both a quantitative and a qualitative approach in our experiments we can not only measure how quickly or how accurately or how many times a group of participants perform an action, but we can also gain an insight into their thoughts, feelings and motivations while they are performing those actions and vice versa. Such an approach allows a far more rounded and informed insight into human thought and action, and we trust that by the end of this topic you will agree that the mixed methods approach should be used with greater frequency in research designs. [MUSIC]Hello.Before we move on to focus on mixed methods,we will start with a quick summary and revisionof the qualitative approach to research.Qualitative research is really about tryingto get into the shoes of the participantsand see the world in which they live,and collecting textual information that tells us about the whyinstead of the how fast or the how many.This is in contrast to quantitative researchwhere data must be collected in a rigid and controlled wayto ensure that the data of one participantis comparable to the data of other participants,and whether is often a so-called correct way to analyze the data.In qualitative analysis, the data can be collectedand analyzed in a much more flexible and data-led fashion.Even in a completely unstructured interview,the researcher is likely to have topic areasthat they are specifically interested in,and this interest will, to some extent, guide conversation.However, the wording of the questions,the style of asking the questions, and the order of questionscan vary dramatically from one interview or focus group to another.Often with questions being created during the interviewin response to the information provided by the participant.The same flexibility in collection is trueof the analysis of qualitative data, where the content of the dataguides the analysis and critical considerationas opposed to quantitative data where specific standardizedand agreed-upon techniques are deemed appropriatefor specific types of design and data.As a result of this, greater flexibilityand focus on textural rather than numerical dataallows qualitative research to gain an insightinto human thought and action that is not possibleusing only a quantitative approach.Within qualitative research, the most common approachesto data collection are, firstly, reviews.This involves considering preexisting documentationsuch as guidelines, policy documents, archived interviews, diary entries, and so on.For example, reviewing the guidelines on howa particular psychological condition is diagnosed and treated,for example, anorexia.Secondly, observation.This, as it suggests, involves observing a particular setting,behavior or both.Observations can occur as a participant in the event.For example, a mental health practitioner may observe the way that a patient with anorexia is treated when they first enter a clinical setting.Alternatively, observations can be non-participatory,with the researcher monitoring a particular situation from a distance, trying to avoid influence in the situation in any way.Thirdly, interviews.These can be structured with a very specific set of questionsasked in a very specific order.Semi-structured, where the researcher startswith a set of pre-defined questions,but other questions are generated as the interview progresses,and finally, unstructured interviews where there are no clear predetermined questions beyond reference to the general topic area, which then guides the rest of the interview or conversation.Finally, focus groups.These involve group interviews exploring the expertiseor experiences of those individuals who form part of an appropriate group of individuals.For example, you may interview a group of peoplewho have previously been diagnosed and/or treated for anorexiato gain an understanding and insight into their experiencesof the diagnosis and treatment process.Importantly, there is no hierarchy or set order from which these approaches need to occur.Research can simply use one approach or use a mixed order.For example, a researcher may conduct a focus groupto gain insight into a particular area, then review existing documentation, then use this information to develop a series of questions and conduct a range of interviewsbefore going back to review relevant documentation,observe specific situations, and finish with another round of focus groups.Each stage can be used to inform the nextwith no specific order required.Ultimately, as stated above, the real aim of qualitative researchis to really try to use these different approachesto try to understand and describe what your participants are experiencing in their lives,with a focus on the validity of the research dataas opposed to reliability and consistent reproductionof the same pattern in the research dataas is the aim of quantitative analysis.Hopefully, this information all feels familiar to you,and this short lecture has been useful in helping youto revise the aims and approaches used in qualitative analysis.The next activity will involve reading two textsto further consolidate your understanding of this techniquebefore we move on to consider the mixed methods approach.[MUSIC]"

"can you help me do this: The eligibility stage, a step by step guide

Step 1: Complete the Screening Stage
Objective: Quickly filter out papers that are clearly irrelevant to the research question based on titles and abstracts alone.
Purpose: This stage quickly reduces the number of papers, allowing you to focus on those with potential relevance.
Process: Review each paper's title and abstract to confirm whether it:
Mentions both key concepts you’re analyzing (e.g., specific variables or populations relevant to your question).
Is a peer-reviewed journal article (exclude book chapters, theses, and prior reviews or meta-analyses).
Meets any additional inclusion criteria (e.g., age group or study type).
Report the papers you keep after screening in the worksheet (course 6)

Step 2: Transition to the Eligibility Stage
Objective: Move to the eligibility stage to examine the remaining papers in greater detail using the full texts. Here, you’ll check for alignment with the specific requirements of your research question.
Full Text Access: Ensure that you have access to the complete articles for each paper. This stage cannot proceed without full-text access.

Step 3: Define Specific Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Tailor the Criteria: Adjust the criteria to fit the unique aspects of your research question, ensuring they address key concepts in your study. Examples might include:
Variable or Measurement Inclusion: Ensure the study includes a measurable variable or metric that directly relates to your research question.
Population Focus: Define any age group, demographic, or setting requirements relevant to your research.
Design Constraints: State whether only certain study designs (e.g., experimental, observational) are acceptable.
Example Criteria (Generalized):
Inclusion: Studies must include quantifiable data on a key variable (e.g., cognitive development or social behavior) that can support statistical analysis.
Exclusion: Studies lacking specific measures or only offering qualitative descriptions may be excluded unless justified by your question.
Report the criteria in the worksheet (Course 6)

Step 4: Focus on Key Sections of Each Paper
Methods Section: Look for detailed descriptions of the study's methods to confirm that they meet your criteria. For example:
What specific measurement tools or scales were used?
Are these measurements valid for the aspect you’re analyzing (e.g., cognitive skills, social behavior)?
Results Section: Check if the results include analyses that align with your question.
Are relevant variables included in the reported analysis?

Step 5: Verify the Suitability of Measures and Analyses
Variable Types: Ensure that the variables measured are suitable for the type of analysis your SLR requires. For instance:
Quantitative Measures: Continuous, count, or dichotomous variables that allow for statistical testing.
Qualitative Measures: If relevant to your question, verify that qualitative measures are analyzed systematically (e.g., thematic coding).
Align with Research Intent: Verify that the measures and analyses can feasibly contribute to answering your specific research question.

Step 6: Confirm Temporal or Causal Sequence (if needed)
Longitudinal or Causal Studies: If your research question involves time-ordered or causal relationships, check that studies measure variables in the correct sequence.
Example: If researching the effect of a teaching intervention on knowledge retention, confirm that the intervention predates the retention measurement.

Step 7: Address Practical Considerations
Full-Text Access: Ensure each study is accessible. Lack of access is a valid exclusion reason if no alternative source is available.
Language Accessibility: Only include studies in languages you or your research team can analyze effectively.

Step 8: Record Findings in ou worksheet
Eligibility Spreadsheet: Keep a detailed record for each paper, noting:
Whether it meets inclusion criteria.
Reasons for exclusion (e.g., “No measurable variable for X,” “Non-accessible full text”).
Notes on Ambiguities: If uncertain about including a paper, add a note and revisit it during your final review of all papers.
Report these into the worksheet (course 6)

Step 9: Complete the Process for Each Paper
Repeat and Review: Apply these steps to each remaining paper systematically. This ensures consistency and rigor in the eligibility assessment phase."

"Hello, please put yourself in the role of an LSE professor in Politics and International Relations teaching the subject 'Democracy and Democratisation' and summarise easily to your student, without repeating yourself, this academic text: 13 Democracy and Decolonization: East-Central Europe
Laurence Whitehead
1. Introduction
The comparative analysis of democratization processes was a flourishing branch of political science well before the dismantling of the Berlin Wall, on 10 November 1989. That event, its timing, and the transformations through East- Central Europe which it symbolized, were unforeseen not only by virtually all academic observers, but also by world statesmen, foreign ministries, and media commentators. Certainly the available stock of democratization theory was not capable of predicting—or even of strongly suggesting—the course, speed, or sequencing of political developments that converted all the six non-Soviet members of the Warsaw Pact from Communist-ruled regimes into polities operating under more or less competitive electoral systems within about a year. Fortunately such predictive power is not an essential requirement of useful work in comparative politics.
This chapter is based on the assumption that, with the benefit of hindsight, it can still be helpful to re-examine the political upheavals of 1989 deploying the categories and hypotheses distilled from earlier experiences of democratization.Butequally,thesepreexistinganalyticaltoolsmayhavetoberevisedorrefinedinthelightof East-Central European experiences. Initial approaches to the theory of democratization derived from a restrictive range of Latin American and southern European processes which took place within a securely bipolar world, with the result that the international dimension was downplayed and conceived in a restrictive manner. Even with regard to those earlier processes some reconsideration may be called for, given the heightened prominence of international influences apparent in many subsequent cases of regime transition.
However, before the 1989 democratizations can be invoked to justify a possibly wholesale reconstruction of previous analyticalwork,weneedtoconsiderwhethertheseprocessesdoindeedbelonginthesameclassificatoryschemaasthe earlier processes. Participants in the events of 1989 certainly invoked the same vocabulary—of democratization, human and civic rights, the rule of law, and clean and open elections—as their Latin American and southern European predecessors; and indeed, they drew on powerful and long-standing shared traditions of enlightenment liberalism. To some extent they even made explicit cross-references to non-Communist democratizations. Nevertheless, the regimes theyweredismantling(single-party-ruledcommandeconomies)wereverydifferentinstructurefromtheconservative capitalist authoritarian regimes on which most theorizing was based. Transition to a market economy was viewed as an integral (possibly even the dominant) component of democratization. Social structures (universal welfare provision, absence of a strong autonomous civil sphere, or of market-related professional associations) and geopolitical settings were also very different.
The first question to consider, therefore, is whether such key analytical terms as ‘democratization’, ‘consolidation’, and ‘transition’ carry substantially different connotations when deployed in the East-Central European context. This topic is taken up in the second section of the chapter. Then the third section turns to a key feature of the international context that differentiates these from earlier experiences—the persistence for over forty years of a Soviet military veto over full democratization, and the reasons why that veto was lifted in the late 1980s. The fourth section turns to other distinctive features of the international environment, that can be grouped together under the heading ‘the role of the West’.Itconsidersthevariousinfluencesflowingfrom‘theWest’,andtheireffectsinshapingthecourseandcontent of local democratizing impulses. The fifth section reflects on the interactions that took place once the transitions got under way, and relates this to comparative debates on the prospects for democratic consolidation. The conclusion draws together these arguments about the relative weight of various types of international influence on the East- Central European democratizations, and reflects on the implications for pre-existing analysis."

can you make notes:  • systematic literature searching

  PS70CH09_Siddaway ARI 31 July 2018 13:51
in what researchers perceive constitutes quality (Valentine & Cooper 2005), and study quality scales have been shown to be unreliable assessments of validity ( Juni et al. 1999). It is noteworthy that the use of scales for assessing quality or risk of bias is explicitly discouraged in Cochrane reviews. A study quality tool should not be used to determine inclusion or exclusion from your review. If study quality is somehow to be examined empirically, a considered approach is required. It is probably preferable to look separately at a few workable indicators of bias risk rather than calculating a summary score. These indicators can be used to estimate the degree to which the literature that forms the content of the systematic review may have been affected by bias.
We welcome further research on this issue and rigorous psychometric testing of study quality tools. Although it is often taken as a given that systematic reviews should account for study quality, numerous scholars have drawn attention to the fact that the existing tools and procedures for determining study quality need considerable revision.
After we have generated our criteria,we need to think the way to use them to compare studies against each other.Doing this in a quantitative numerical wayis a method of making this objective and replicable.However, the criteria chosen need to be grounded in theory,research, or academic perspective.To help us think about this, you might want to pause the video and either reviewor have to hand the criteria for assessing the quality of a studythat we looked at at the end of the last video lecture.Let’s think about the study design as an example.We might say that all studies with a longitudinal design will geta score of one because they are the best designs to answer the question.However, a between-subjects designor cross-sectional might get a score of 0.5 becausealthough it is not as high quality as a longitudinal design,there are better than case studies which we might give a score of 0.25.This allows us to consider that many differentdesigns may be used to answer a questionand some designs are higher in quality than others.We can then give a score of zeroif that aspect of the method is not reported.You should pause the video hereand consider how you would weight the three criteria that you cameup with in the discussion activity in the first lesson of this topic.[music]After you have designed all of your criteriafor assessing the quality of the study,for each paper, you need to work through the criteriaand identify the extent to which it satisfies each of those criteria.I would suggest doing this in a quantitative wayas we have gone through.The key thing is that developing the criteria shouldbe done as an independent step before applying them and evaluating the papers.However, I should say at this point,that you may not necessarily need to reinventthe wheel here as there are some systemsor scales for evaluating the quality of evidence for a systematicliterature review which have already been developed,published, and have been used.Therefore, you may want to do some independent study to find theseand use them as a source of inspiration.[music]When we are thinking about the aspects of a study,that mean that it is higher quality in terms of the evidence,we should also consider that some of the criteriaare going to be more important than others.For example, we might say that whether the studyis a longitudinal design or not,is more important than whether the research useda validated measure or not.If a study is a longitudinal design, it is considered to be of higher qualityregardless of whether the measure was validated or not.An advantage of developing your criteria to be implemented in a quantitative wayis that we can numerically weight the importance of the criteria.For example, we may choose to give a higher numberto the criteria that are more important.How can we do this?Well, after identifying your criteria, you need to list or order themfrom most important to least importantand this can then inform how you quantitatively weight them.For example, you could choose to double the scores for certain criteriaor multiply it by a higher number to reflect their importance.For example,if we say that the study design is more important than the sample,we can multiply the output for study design by two or threeand the output for sample by one.[music]"

can you explain these more in depth: • psychological adjustment 
• coping models 
• coping strategies 
• social support.  

Psychological Adjustment to Chronic Illness
	• Chronic illness impacts multiple areas of life, including:
		○ Emotional well-being (e.g., anxiety, depression).
		○ Physical health and management of symptoms.
		○ Lifestyle changes (e.g., activity restrictions, dietary adjustments).
		○ Education/work (e.g., reduced productivity, career interruptions).
		○ Self-esteem (e.g., altered identity, body image).
		○ Social relationships (e.g., isolation, role changes).
	• Moss-Morris (2013): Advocates for a unified theory of adjustment to chronic illness.
	• Sharpe & Curran (2006): Focus on understanding psychological processes of adjustment to chronic illness.

Coping Models
Coping is conceptualized as the strategies individuals use to manage stressors, such as a chronic illness diagnosis.
1. Shontz’s Three Stages of Coping (1975)
	• Shock: Initial reaction involving disbelief, numbness, and confusion.
	• Encounter: Emotional distress arises as the reality of the illness is acknowledged; active attempts to make sense of the situation.
	• Retreat: Regressive coping to deny or minimize the illness, potentially followed by adaptation.
2. Moos & Schaefer’s Crisis Theory (1984)
Focus: How people respond to the crisis of illness.
	• Crisis Components:
		○ Personal appraisal of the illness.
		○ Available coping mechanisms.
		○ Social and environmental resources.
	• Three Stages:
		1. Cognitive Appraisal: Understanding the situation.
		2. Coping Tasks: Managing illness-related problems (physical, emotional, and interpersonal).
		3. Adaptive Processes: Developing long-term strategies to maintain psychological balance.
3. Taylor’s Theory of Social Adjustment (1983)
	• Focus: Adaptation involves finding meaning, regaining control, and boosting self-esteem.
	• Strategies:
		○ Finding Meaning: Reframing illness as a challenge or opportunity.
		○ Mastery: Regaining perceived control through proactive behaviors.
		○ Enhancing Self-Esteem: Comparing oneself favorably with others in similar situations.

Coping Strategies
	• Adaptive Coping: Enhances well-being and adjustment. Examples:
		○ Problem-focused coping: Addressing specific stressors (e.g., following treatment plans).
		○ Emotion-focused coping: Managing emotional responses (e.g., seeking therapy, mindfulness).
	• Maladaptive Coping: Impairs adjustment. Examples:
		○ Avoidance, denial, or substance use.

Social Support and Well-Being
Social support is crucial in mitigating the psychological burden of chronic illness.
Cohen & Wills (1985): Stress, Social Support, and the Buffering Hypothesis
	• Two models explaining the link between social support and well-being:
		1. Buffering Hypothesis: Social support protects individuals from the negative effects of stress.
			§ Mechanisms:
				□ Reduces perceived threat.
				□ Provides resources for problem-solving.
		2. Direct Effects Model: Social support directly enhances health and well-being, regardless of stress levels.
			§ Mechanisms:
				□ Improves emotional state through companionship.
				□ Encourages healthy behaviors through social norms.
Implications for Interventions
	• Supportive networks: Building social connections (family, friends, peer groups).
	• Preventive measures: Integrating social support into health interventions (e.g., support groups, community programs).

Key Concepts
	1. Psychological adjustment is a dynamic process influenced by emotional, social, and environmental factors.
	2. Coping models offer frameworks to understand and support individuals facing chronic illness.
Social support plays a pivotal role in promoting well-being and mitigating the effects of stressors."

"What are the key sections of this essay? In their early days the Arab uprisings in the West often were welcomed as a grand emancipatory project. Undoubtedly, the dominant media representations in 2011 endeared the protestors to their Western audiences. As Lin Noueihed and Alex Warren aptly summarized, ‘[t]hey
were young. They spoke English or French. Their voices dominated Twitter and Facebook.
They looked and sounded like people might on the streets of London or New York. They
were not chanting religious slogans. They did not carry weapons.’1
 Five years later, however,
assessments are less sanguine. In Egypt, the democratically elected president, Mohamed
Morsi is imprisoned, and the Egyptian deep state controlled by the military establishment
has re-asserted its control. Democratic reform in Morocco and Jordan has been modest;
Libya has descended into civil war; and in Syria half of the population has been displaced
as a result of a brutal sectarian war that international humanitarian intervention seems to
perpetuate. Only Tunisia, having in early 2014 adopted a constitution that many deemed
highly democratic, stands out. Instead of trying to account for those unfulfilled promises,2
this article seeks to contribute to a critical assessment of the Arab uprisings by engaging the
ways in which they have been represented discursively in the West.

From such a perspective, one may notice that the Arab uprisings demonstrated that the
days when a comfortable consensus could be upheld over what global political events
meant are long gone. Western-based media outlets were faced with more competition than
ever before in shaping the unfolding narrative. As governments were being overthrown in
Tunisia, Egypt and Libya, the struggle over the meaning of those events began. Former US
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned that US media was losing the ‘information war’
in the Middle East to Al-Jazeera,
3
 which often presented events rather differently than mainstream US media such as CNN. Not only did the media present the uprisings differently, but
even from a cursory glance at the statements of politicians as well as the early scholarship,
it is clear that what became known as the ‘Arab Spring’ was taken to mean rather different
things to different observers. Given the long-standing debate over how the Arab world has
been portrayed in the West, discursive representation of the Arab uprisings is undoubtedly
an important issue when trying to make sense of Western responses, or lack thereof, to
developments in the region. Some authors, usually without much elaboration, have asserted
that there were ‘Orientalist biases’ in the ways in which the uprisings were represented in
the West.4
 In this article, I empirically examine the question of whether, and if so how, the
Arab uprisings were inserted into an Orientalist narrative in Western foreign policy elite
discourse. I do so by systematically examining all speeches on the Arab uprisings made by
former US Secretary of State Clinton, as well as the major statements made by European
Union leaders. In doing so, I wish to engage and shed some light on Western elite foreign
policy discursive representations of the uprisings.
In the longest section of this article, I reconstruct and problematize a prominent elite
narrative about the Arab uprisings. On what I call the liberal civilizing narrative, the Arab
uprisings are seen as popular manifestations for liberal democracy and human rights. The
core of this narrative is the idea that beneath layers of whatever goes under the name of
‘history,’ ‘tradition’ and ‘culture’ is a liberal subject who finally has come of age and no
longer is willing to tolerate encroachments of her/his essential sovereignty. This narrative
emphasizes the essential identity between the Arab world and the West. That is, it holds that
there is no ontological difference between the two entities. Even though such a narrative
to some extent breaks with Orientalizing narrations of the Arab region in a spatial sense,
it establishes Western powers as legitimate monitors of how the Arab uprisings unfold, by
introducing a notion of time. This notion, in the form of allegedly successful progress on
achieving democratic and human rights protecting societies, differentiates the Western world
from Middle East and North African (MENA) societies, and is ultimately what establishes the
authority of the West. Human rights in this narrative play a crucial role since their universality
guarantees that the West knows what the Arab world wants. Human rights ultimately stand
in for a certain discursive terrain where communication is possible without coercion, and
the universal appeal of human rights makes the liberal civilizing narrative one about benign
patterns of social learning rather than one about imposition or coercion.
In light of this problematic hierarchical rendition of subjectivity, the third section of the
article considers a major representational challenge to the liberal civilizing narrative, a challenge that I call culturalism. Here, the universalizing liberal subject who lies at the core of the
liberal civilizational narrative is treated with great caution. In its most radical instantiation,
such a critique holds that the rights-bearing subject that the liberal civilizational narrative

posits as universal is instead a particular (modern Euro-Western), gendered (male), sexualized (heterosexual), and racialized (white) subject.5
 Seeking to insert the Arab uprisings in
a liberal civilizing narrative therefore is understood as a form of epistemic violence, which
fails to do justice to different modes of life. However, culturalist positions are profoundly
problematic in that they tend to reify certain representations of ‘culture’ to the detriment
of others. Rather than opening up more areas of global life for political contestation, such
positions tend to depoliticize socio-political relations in the name of culture.
The penultimate section of my article suggests that both the liberal civilizing narrative and
the culturalist critique thereof risk failing to take seriously the politics and the struggle in the
rights claims that are being made. Instead of reading the rights claims into a pre-ordained
and already articulated path to progress, or making such claims suspicious as a form of
Western imperialism, following Karen Zivi I would like to suggest that a decolonized understanding of the human rights discourse deployed during the Arab uprisings should rather
point us to perceive the rights claims made by the protestors as parts of a concrete political
struggle and a ‘practice of democratic citizenship.’6
 Such an understanding challenges both
the hierarchical rendition of subjectivity, which the liberal civilizational narrative enacts,
and the ‘culturalisation of politics’ as an alleged, but ultimately flawed, critical rejoinder.7"

"can you help me start this coursework: Coursework description 
Your research report will report on a single study. Your task is to evaluate the factor structure of a proposed R Anxiety Inventory (RAQ), a measure of trait statistics anxiety, specifically in  the context of the R statistical programming language. Statistics anxiety may be narrowly  defined as “the feelings of anxiety encountered when taking a statistics course or doing  statistical analyses”. In addition, the RAQ has been designed to measure specific forms of  anxiety, related to learning the R language. Therefore, we expect that it will have a multi 
factorial structure. The questionnaire contains 13 questions. Each question is a statement  followed by a five-point Likert scale ranging from ‘strongly disagree’ through ‘neither agree  nor disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’. The items are displayed in the appendix, at the end of this  document. To test the factor structure of this scale, it has been administered to a sample of 2571  subjects. Your task is to conduct and report an exploratory factor of this sample. 
You need to complete the following tasks: 
1) Evaluate the Factor Structure of the Scale 
Use an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to evaluate the factor structure of the R Anxiety  Questionnaire (RAQ). Describe what the purpose of this test is, what the results tell you, and  whether some items need to be excluded based on the analysis. Then, if necessary, perform  another EFA on the revised scale (e.g., after dropping some problematic items). The paper by  Costello and Osborne (2005) will give you tips how to report and perform your factor analyses,  complementing the lecture and practical on this topic. 
Please use the oblimin rotation and Maximum likelihood estimation! For determining the  number of factors, I would combine the Kaiser criterion and the scree plot technique. You may  need to drop certain items. There is no single ‘correct’ solution! The point is to make informed  decisions, and to communicate them clearly.
Some notes 
You can use whatever software you like, but obviously, I recommend JASP. 
After a bit of searching, you may realise that this example is in fact from chapter 17 of the  wonderful statistics textbook by Andy Field, Jeremy Miles and Zoe Field (2012). You may be  tempted to just copy and paste the analyses presented in the book, however I changed the details  of the EFA. I also changed them compared to last year, so the results will not agree with either  the textbook or with previous courseworks by your peers. Nevertheless, feel free to look at  the Field chapter for guidance! It is very good. 
Submission  
Please submit your courseworks in either word or pdf format on the appropriate Google  Classroom assignment. 
Grading 
The point of this is to prepare you for the UoL coursework, and not to replace it. I will not be  giving you a grade. Instead, I will aim to give you constructive and personalized feedback to  guide you. 
Word count 
As there is no grading, it will not be reflected in your grades, but given the importance of word  limits in the UoL criteria, and more broadly in academic works, it will certainly benefit you to  learn to be concise. So stay under the maximum word limit of 2500 words! 
Plagiarism 
I feel like it is redundant to say, but DO NOT PLAGIARISE! Not only will it hinder your  academic progress and learning outcomes, but it is also a habit you do not want to start getting  into. Ask yourselves if you would work with someone who cheated their way into their degree,  or what you would think of a scientist that stole or falsified their results, and act accordingly.
Guide 
The same guidelines apply as the UoL coursework, so I merely reproduce them here. With some  added notes by me. 
Abstract 
This should be a concise but informative summary of the report. Note that the word limit of 150  words is quite challenging, so leave yourself plenty of time to write and edit your Abstract. The  Abstract should go at the beginning of the report on its own page. You may wish to write the  abstract last. 
You should definitely write this last! 
Introduction 
Include your title above the text for your Introduction. Centre the title. You must provide  relevant background information for your reader that sets out why this research has been done  and prepares them for what they will read in the remainder of the report. Use your Introduction  to set out the aims of the investigation: this may be done by referring directly to the tests of  factor structure that you will perform. Predictions and/or research questions should be  motivated by theory and/or previous research. As a general guide, a good length for the  Introduction section for this report is around one-fifth to one-quarter of the length of the main  text of the report. (If it is much longer than that, you may end up omitting important information  from other sections of the report. If it is much shorter than that, you will have difficulty  providing enough background and motivation for your study.) 
Obviously, the questionnaire and the data are fictitious, and a bit silly. Nevertheless, for the  sake of your report, treat them seriously. Moreover, statistics anxiety is a real phenomenon, that  has been studied by psychologists. So there is a literature that you should briefly summarize to  contextualize the report. This review can get you started: 
Chew, P. K. H., & Dillon, D. B. (2014). Statistics Anxiety Update: Refining the Construct and  Recommendations for a New Research Agenda. Perspectives on Psychological Science, 9(2),  196–208. https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691613518077 
Methods 
You should follow the usual convention of writing up the methods section from the perspective  of the researcher (e.g., “Participants completed …”). Try to use active voice rather than passive  voice (e.g., “I analysed the data…” rather than “The data were analysed…”). Make sure that  you describe your sample (e.g., demographics). 
Describe the variables that were measured, how they were measured, aim to provide sufficient  detail to allow exact replication of your work. 
Results 
Your results section should cover the analyses set out above. Make sure you explain for each  analysis why you conduct it and what you found. Most importantly, make sure you fully address  the analyses relevant to the questions above (report how the data was analysed, and the  descriptive and inferential statistics).
The report sections on the activity worksheets should be your primary guide for this section. Discussion 
Keep your discussion focussed on your findings, what they mean, and what more could be done  in a future study to clarify any issues that could not be resolved by your analyses. The length  of your Discussion will likely depend somewhat on the level of detail of your Introduction. If  your Introduction includes a lot of detail on the theories tested, and is quite long, then your  Discussion can likely be a little shorter, because the reader already knows all the relevant points  of theory and you can therefore simply connect your findings to that previously described  theory. 
Reference 
Include a Reference section with the references listed and set out according to APA  conventions. You may use either APA 6 or APA 7. You must indicate on your cover sheet  which you have chosen to use, and you must be consistent throughout (i.e., do not switch  between APA 6 and 7). 
I think it is wise to always use the latest version, therefore APA 7. Also, if you have not already,  I highly recommend familiarising yourselves with a citation manager. Zotero  (https://www.zotero.org/) and Mendeley (https://www.mendeley.com/) are the most often used,  and both are extremely useful. 
Appendices 
Appendices may be used if you wish to provide full details on something that is not practical to  provide these within the Main Text of the report. You do not need to include an Appendix and,  where you do, make sure it is absolutely necessary to do so. Keep it as concise as possible. The  contents of any Appendices do not contribute to the word count for the main text. Note,  however, that you should not regard Appendices as alternative means of providing essential  information that you could not fit into the Main Text of the report. Make sure that all essential  information is provided in your methods and results within the Main Text of the report. You  will lose marks if you do not include essential information in the main text. 
Style, structure and presentation 
Use the guidance in textbooks and APA-style journal articles to structure and write your report.  Your objective is to make your report easy to read and straightforward to understand (e.g., if  additional subheadings help the readers understanding, then it is a good idea to use additional  subheadings). 
Any ‘standard’ version of English may be used for determining spelling and grammar: for  example, you can use the spelling “colour” (British English) or “color” (American English). However, please be consistent (e.g., stick to one spelling throughout your report)—though use  whichever spelling the original author(s) used when quoting directly from a paper, or listing it  in your References section. 
Some useful writing tools you may want to experiment with: 
DeepL (https://www.deepl.com/translator) for any translation that is necessary.
Quillbot (https://quillbot.com/) and Wordtune (https://www.wordtune.com/) for paraphrasing  and rewriting. 
Paper Digest (https://www.paper-digest.com/) for summarizing. 
A note on tables and figures 
All tables and figures should be formatted according to APA-style. Word is helpful for creating  tables; Excel is a useful programme to get the formatting right for figures. All tables and figures  need to be easy to understand and should be referred to in the main text. Tables and figures are  powerful tools to present findings. Use them to convey an idea or essential results. 
Formatting  
Your research report should follow the standard format for a psychology research report (Title,  Abstract, Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion, References) and should follow APA  conventions for in-text referencing. In addition to the main section headings (Introduction,  Method, etc.) it is recommended that you use sub-headings (of your choice) in the Method  section, and elsewhere if you feel that this helps the reader to follow your report.  
The maximum length for the Main Text of the research report (Introduction + Method + Results  + Discussion) is 2500 words. The word count includes headings and sub-headings. Avoid using  footnotes and note that footnotes are included in the word count. The contents of figures and  tables and their associated titles and captions are not included in this word count. Tables  and figures, if included, should be placed at an appropriate place within the main text of the  report; and not at the end of the report as is sometimes seen in ‘draft’ work. The Coversheet,  Title, Abstract and the References section are not included in the word count for the Main  Text. The maximum length for the Abstract is 150 words.  
For this assignment, write your own title for the report, the title has a word limit of 12  words.

"Dear Josefine Pernes,

I hope this email finds you well.

We are a group of second-year Bachelor students from Forward College (accredited by the London School of Economics and Political Science) in Paris, currently working on VERIDA—a platform designed to enhance transparency in the often complex landscape of scholarships. Our goal is to help students navigate funding opportunities with ease by providing structured, reliable and particularly transparent information and connecting them with alumni who have firsthand experience with various scholarships. We particularly focus on students facing challenges related to academic sensitivity and, at this stage, have included Malaysia, Singapore, Turkey, Hungary, China, and Germany in our database. We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the scholarships available, including the attached values, organisations and people, so that prospective students can make an informed decision. With that we want to make an effort towards ensuring that students are not restricted by their academic backgrounds but can pursue their studies and ambitions freely, regardless of financial or institutional barriers.

Our professor, António Dias, kindly referred us to you. As part of our efforts to ensure the credibility of our platform, we have already engaged with various alumni and scholarship foundations. However, we believe that collaborating with V-Dem would add significant value to our project by allowing us to connect with experts from different countries for additional fact-checking and information. We are currently still working on our prototype, hence such an exchange would be extremely valuable and transformative for us. Given that the majority of our team specializes in Politics and International Relations, we are well-acquainted with V-Dem’s extensive work and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to explore potential synergies. V-Dem’s rigorous, data-driven approach is what we strive to bring to the scholarship landscape, ensuring transparency and accessibility for students worldwide in order to level the playing field. 

We would be delighted to schedule an online meeting at your convenience to discuss this further. Please let us know if you would be available for a brief call.

Looking forward to your response.

europäische Integration und die Politik der Europäischen Union stehen im Zentrum meines akademischen und praktischen Interesses. Daher bewerbe ich mich mit großem Interesse für die Position als studentische Mitarbeiterin in der Redaktion des „Taschenbuchs der europäischen Integration – Europa von A bis Z“.
Ich studiere im vierten Semester Politics & International Relations an Forward College, einem in Kooperation mit der University of London und der London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) angebotenen Studiengang. Mein Studium führt mich jedes Jahr in ein anderes europäisches Land – nach Lissabon, Paris und Berlin – und bietet mir so eine fundierte akademische Ausbildung mit einer zugleich praktischen, international vergleichenden Perspektive.
Durch meine bisherigen Tätigkeiten habe ich bereits Erfahrung in der redaktionellen Arbeit gesammelt. Als Produktmanagerin eines studentischen Teams entwickle ich eine digitale Plattform zur Förderung der politischen Partizipation junger Menschen in Frankreich, bei der ich für die inhaltliche Gestaltung und die Qualitätssicherung von Texten verantwortlich bin. Darüber hinaus war ich Teil der deutschen Mission der Wahlhilfe-App Palumba, einer paneuropäischen Initiative zur Förderung der Jugendbeteiligung bei Wahlen. Dort war ich verantwortlich für die Erstellung von Hintergrundinformationen, Definitionen komplexer Begriffe, die Textgestaltung für unsere Zielgruppe und die Anpassung der App an den deutschen Kontext. Zudem verfüge ich über langjährige Erfahrung im journalistischen Bereich. Während meiner gesamten Schulzeit engagierte ich mich in verschiedenen journalistischen Plattformen und war zuletzt Managing Editor der von Studierenden geführten Zeitung bei Forward College. Diese Tätigkeiten haben meine analytischen Fähigkeiten, mein Sprachgefühl und meine redaktionelle Präzision geschärft.
Besonders reizt mich an der ausgeschriebenen Position die Möglichkeit, an einer renommierten Publikation des IEP mitzuarbeiten, wissenschaftliche Texte zu redigieren und an deren Veröffentlichung mitzuwirken. Durch mein Studium sowie meine extracurricularen Aktivitäten, wie das European Youth Parliament und Model United Nations, bringe ich ein ausgeprägtes Interesse an europäischer Politik mit. Zudem verfüge ich über ausgezeichnete Kenntnisse der deutschen Rechtschreibung und Grammatik sowie Erfahrung in der Recherche und Texterstellung.
Ich arbeite präzise, strukturiert und zuverlässig. Mein selbständiger und wissenschaftlicher Arbeitsstil wird durch meine Team- und Organisationsfähigkeit ergänzt. Außerdem verfüge ich über sehr gute Englischkenntnisse (C2).
Ich würde mich sehr freuen, mein Wissen und meine Fähigkeiten in Ihr Team einzubringen. Gerne stehe ich für ein persönliches Gespräch zur Verfügung und freue mich auf Ihre Rückmeldung.

"give me a detailed summary of representative democracy from this text in bulletpoints, use citations and quotes from the text: In representative democracy citizens elect candidates periodically in order
to represent them in institutions and make decisions on their behalf. This

understanding was articulated seven decades ago by thinkers such as Schum-
peter (1943), who argued that democracy is about competitive elite politics

and methods for “selecting leaders, rather than about popular participation in
politics as such” (Saward, 2003, p. 56). For its advocates then and now, given the
complexities of governance and policymaking, this seems the most “workable
form of democracy” (Elstub & McLaverty, 2014, p. 13). From this perspective,

democratic participation is about citizens casting votes and allowing repre-
sentatives and officials to get on with the business of governing until the next

election.

Dahl’s work in the 1950s is a key exponent of the dominant notion of plu-
ralism built on the Schumpeterian narrative of democracy. Dahl (1989b)

understood pluralism as the aggregation of citizens’ interests through diverse
political parties and interest groups, so that democracy features multiple
centres of power and counters authoritarianism. Furthermore, he considered
this to be the distinguishing feature of modern democratic regimes: “What for
centuries was held to be the lethal poison of republics, the spirit of faction,
is in modern democracies institutionalized in parties and interest groups”
(Dahl, 1982, p. 28). In this pluralist model, the accommodation of difference
and the resolution of conflict take place through bargaining and exchange
amongst the leaders of competing groups (Barber, 2003, p. 144).
The making of publics in representative democracy takes therefore place
in aggregative fashion. By aggregating the individual preferences of citizens,

the goal of electoral participation is to decide what “leaders, rules, and policies
will best correspond to the most widely and strongly held preferences” (Young,

2000, p. 19). Accordingly, democracy is a “competitive process” in which politi-
cal parties “attempt to satisfy the largest number of people’s preferences”, and

publics are constructed on the basis of like-minded citizens organising inter-
est groups in order to “influence the actions of parties and policy-makers once

they are elected” (Ibid.).
The role of citizens in this conception of democracy is minimalist. They
are invited to be voters, and as Schumpeter put it, “once they have elected an
individual, political action is his business and not theirs” (Saward, 2003, p. 41).

Therefore, citizens are offered to be mainly “spectators in the game of poli-
tics”, which remains the preserve of political and interest group elites (Dryzek,

1990, p. 120). It is difficult to overstate the predominance of this way of thinking
and enacting democracy. Today, in the eyes of many, democracy means mostly
representative democracy (Hibbing & Theiss-Morse, 2002; cf. Neblo, Esterling,
Kennedy, Lazer, & Sokhey, 2010).
Nonetheless, increasing recognition of the shortcomings of this model
has opened up space for alternatives that seek to enhance representative

democracy by developing new meanings and practices. This has been par-
ticularly driven by the demands of contemporary governance and policymak-
ing. Warren (2009, p. 6) highlights the growing incapacities of representative

democracy with respect to policy development and implementation. Under

the standard model, citizens elect representatives to make policy on their be-
half, who then direct administrators to further develop it. However, Warren

explains, those underpinning linkages are broken by the realities of contem-
porary governance. Firstly, territorial electoral constituencies seldom match

issue constituencies. Secondly, electoral systems “only roughly reflect citizen
preferences, and they do so in highly aggregated, information-poor ways”.
Thirdly, legislatures have “very low policy-making capacities, and so pass most
decisions to executives ... and agencies”, which are “often left to guess what
constituents want”. Finally, bureaucratic forms of policy development also

feature “inherent limitations” stemming from hierarchical rigidity and enor-
mous technical and political complexity. In this context, policy-makers in-
creasingly “speak the language of trust, collaboration” and citizen engagement

to compensate “for low global legitimacy of electoral democracy by generating

legitimacy ... issue by issue, policy by policy, and constituency by constituen-
cy” (Warren, 2009, pp. 7–8).

Accordingly, conventional liberal notions of “representative democracy

plus techno-bureaucratic administration” (Fung & Wright, 2003b, p. 3) are be-
ing challenged on various grounds. For Dalton (2004, p. 1), the main challenge

Pluralism and Democratic Participation 421

contemporary pragmatism 14 (2017) 416-438

<UN>

comes from citizens, who seem increasingly “distrustful of politicians, sceptical
about democratic institutions, and disillusioned about how the democratic
process functions”. Furthermore, the intensification of social complexity,
coupled with new hierarchies of knowledge and expertise, are deemed to
contribute to deeper and subtler levels of democratic deficit (Fischer, 2009).
Putnam (2000) has also illustrated the deterioration of the relational fabric
of community life –or “social capital”–arguing that this hinders democratic
participation.
While some have questioned such narratives of decline by documenting the
emergence of alternative forms of participation (e.g. Castells, 2012; Norris, 2002),

governments and public agencies have nonetheless increased efforts to institu-
tionalise new participatory and deliberative processes (Escobar, 2014, pp. 3–10).

Accordingly, collaborative governance and public participation arrangements
are presented as strategies to counter democratic deficits, deal with complex
issues, increase problem-solving capacity, foster social capital, and restore
legitimacy to policy-making processes (Callon, Lascoumes, & Barthe, 2009;
De Souza Briggs, 2008; Fischer, 2000). Indeed, representative democracy
has been increasingly infused with ideas and practices of participatory
democracy."

"More complex structural theories: Rueschemeyer and others
One of the key differences between the comparative historical sociology of the late 1980s and early 1990s and the earlier work of Barrington Moore is the greater statistical sophistication of the former. Many attempts have been made to find correlations between democracy or democratisation and other variables. The work of Rueschemeyer, Stephens and Stephens seeks to combine some statistical analysis with historical sociology (1992). The fact that both approaches are combined surely strengthens the work.
Rueschemeyer and others also move away from single-factor explanations of complex historical change in favour of a more nuanced set of explanations. Rueschemeyer et al. seek to explain democratisation in terms of three sets of variables:
• class formation and alliances
• international factors
• the role of the domestic state.
They also look at a different and wider range of cases, including most of South and Central America as well as North America and Europe. This protects them from the criticism levelled at Moore and, to some extent, Lipset – namely, that they are only really interested in the history of countries that today are rich.
The authors conclude that the main agent of democratic change in
Europe was the organised working class. This was less of a factor in South and Central America, where the middle class – whose role in European democratisation was more ambiguous – played a more important role.
In general terms, the landed upper class was the enemy of democracy, while the bourgeoisie was not especially friendly to it either, although it was often in favour of forms of political liberalisation. As for the role of the state, this needed to be strong enough to maintain domestic order
and to act with a degree of internal autonomy, but not so strong that it overpowered civil society as a whole. International factors were sometimes negative for democracy, especially if the country was excessively dependent upon others, but overall they had varying consequences.
As this very brief synopsis of the authors’ conclusions might suggest, the work itself is complex and its methods are sophisticated. Many comments might be made about it, but this discussion will focus particularly on the authors’ treatment of the working class. This is because the main respect in which their treatment differs from that of Moore (and the modernisation writers discussed in the last chapter) is the importance that they give to this particular class. First though, the general role of class analysis is worth a brief discussion at this point.
Marx’s theory of class
Let us start with the question of how one defines what a class is, what
it does and what its interests may be. The first, and one of the most influential, discussions of working-class politics came from Karl Marx, who believed that the working class was a revolutionary class whose historical role was to overthrow capitalism. His argument can be divided into three stages (Marx, 1998; Mann, 1993):
1. He characterised the working class by its relationship to the means of production. In other words, in principle one could find out, by looking at the right kind of statistics, the size of the working class, its location and its potential strength compared with other classes. Marx argued that industrialisation would, in time, spread across much of the world and that this would bring about a very large increase in the absolute numbers and weight of the working class.
2. Theworkingclasswasorganisedinsuchawaythatitwasinherently likely that it would acquire a class consciousness. Marx explicitly characterised some other classes, such as the small peasantry in France, as unlikely to acquire consciousness because a peasant’s experience of work did not bring him (or her) much into contact with other peasants but rather into a world of superiors and (occasionally) subordinates. As we have seen, Marx compared the peasant class to ‘potatoes in a sack’, which rubbed up against each other but did not acquire a collective awareness of each other. Marx believed that working-class consciousness would develop because the factory employers did not socialise with the workers (in the way that agrarian employers often did) but rather built separate workers’ housing, segregated workers within factories and took few measures to organise the workers either industrially or politically.
3. Marx believed that capitalism was incapable of significantly increasing the living standards of the working class. Although there would be economic growth, there would also be increased inequality of income and wealth, and the trade cycle would become increasingly virulent. The working class would try to improve its position within capitalism by reformist means but would fail. Increasingly frustrated, it would then turn its attention to overthrowing the capitalist system itself.

Criticisms of class-based interpretations The variability of capitalism
Much has been said about all three of Marx’s assertions, and it might be best to take them in reverse order. Marx did not actually claim (as his critics have asserted) that the working class would undergo continuous drops in real living standards. He certainly underestimated, however, the likelihood that – where successful – capitalism might deliver quite significant improvements in real wages.
Even by 1900, it was becoming clear that the living standards of the working classes in industrial countries were showing a slow but definite trend towards improvement. It was also the case that under some circumstances, trade unions were able to increase the living standards of those working-class members who were able to join them. The number of middle-class occupations was also slowly increasing. Although it
was true that social inequality remained great, the ability of workers to enjoy limited increases in income introduced an element of choice into revolutionary working-class politics. Should workers seek to improve their position within the system or should they seek to overthrow the system altogether? Some political revolutionaries sought to bring about the overthrow of capitalism by seeking positions of influence within working- class movements.
Since 1900, democratisation has enabled workers and their families to vote for political parties that were able to achieve power and use the tax system and public spending to bring about at least a limited redistribution of income in the direction of poorer people.
Even if one were to accept some of the premises of Marx’s original argument (and he was a perceptive critic of capitalism), it is clear that the urban working class might adopt any of a variety of possible political positions. They might want the overthrow of capitalism, but they might just as easily want to reform the existing system. This brings us to the question of class-consciousness.
What creates class-consciousness?
Why should workers identify themselves politically as members of the working class? There are many other ways in which they might define themselves:
• They could be nationalists or members of a religious party.
• They might have ambitions to upward mobility within the existing system.
• They might decide not to take an active interest in politics and live for their families or their sporting activities instead.
There is not necessarily a connection between membership of a sector of society and social activism of any particular kind.
It might be countered that the working-class experience – which is one of social as well as occupational difference – was inherently socialising under conditions of industrial capitalism. Moreover, political organisations, such as parties and trade unions, tended to offer a social as well as a purely political aspect. Although it might be claimed that there will always be
a tendency for organisations to represent their own interests rather than the interests of their members, there are influences in both directions. A working-class party or a trade-union bureaucracy will not succeed for long without responding in some serious way to what the membership wants.

Nevertheless, working-class interests are not always easy to define. It is reasonable to suppose that the business class is primarily interested in making money – this is not necessarily an interest that will lead to class solidarity, but it is reasonable to suppose that it is an objective that accurately reflects the aspirations of most individual businesspeople. But what is the corresponding working-class interest? Is it to achieve some financial success and so emerge from the working class, to use working-class organisation
to improve the position of the working class within the system, to show solidarity and advance collective class interests (assuming that these can be satisfactorily defined), or to overthrow the existing system altogether?
A critic of Marxist kinds of theory might reasonably express scepticism about whether working-class politics really exist. They do not deny that members
of the working class have engaged in politics or that some organisations,
such as trade unions or parties, identify themselves as working class. They do doubt, however, whether any claim to ‘represent’ a class can be substantiated, and they point out that working-class people have voted for and otherwise supported a range of parties with a wide variety of policies and aspirations. What matters, according to critics, is the nature of the political leadership that successfully attracts working-class support on a sustained basis. That is quite a different matter from the inherent outlook of the support itself.
The limited spread of industrialisation
Marx was more perceptive than many other writers of his generation about the spread and significance of industrialisation; however, this was still a process with limits. During the course of the twentieth century, the relative share of the population involved in manual labour has consistently declined in Europe – at first gradually and then quite quickly. Many former workers, or at least their children, were able to move into the middle class. The USA never had as high a proportion of its population engaged in manufacturing as was the case in Europe, and here too there has been a sustained decline since the early part of the twentieth century. In many Third World countries, only a very few people are engaged in the blue-collar manufacturing jobs regarded as typical working-class work. The political weight of such people has diminished largely in proportion to their diminished numbers.
Rueschemeyer’s treatment of class
Rueschemeyer et al. (1992) are fully aware of these difficulties. They seek to overcome them by defining working-class politics in ‘social’ terms. In other words, they implicitly accept that there is no such thing as a clear- cut definition of working-class interests. One can observe, however, forms of working-class politics that are conducive to democracy; these forms are – according to Rueschemeyer et al. – of key significance in the emergence of democracy.
This argument is defensible, but how illuminating is it? The problem is that working-class politics, as defined by Rueschemeyer et al., may have little to do with any objective definition of the working class. A trade-union official who lives in an expensive house and sends his children to a fee-paying school may be ‘socially’ working class, but is hardly economically so. There is, moreover, a danger of circularity in the explanation. For example, when considering why Mexico and Argentina have experienced difficult transitions to democracy, Rueschemeyer et al. explain that working-class movements in these countries have been co-opted by leaderships whose own commitment to democratic principles is ambiguous at best. At an empirical level, this is indeed true, but it also constitutes an admission that the working class can, under certain circumstances, be co-opted by authoritarian leaders.
Chapter 4: General theories of democratisation
61

86 Democracy and democratisation
62
Nor was this just a matter of authoritarian control. Juan Peron won contested and fair presidential elections in Argentina in 1946 with the willing support of the leaders of organised labour. Rueschemeyer et al.
are left with the observation that the working class is democratic when it is democratically led and that it can, under these circumstances, make a contribution to the establishment of democracy. This argument is probably true, but it is very modest. It becomes even more modest when set beside these authors’ admission that working-class politics mattered far more to democratisation in Europe than it did in South or Central America.
A further question needs to be asked about the argument that Rueschemeyer et al. develop. This has to do with historical specificity or, to put the matter differently, whether there can be (or is) any general pattern to which most cases of democratisation can be expected to correspond. Even if it were true that the working class played a major role in the transition to democracy in (say) nineteenth-century Britain, then why should this also be true of the transition to democracy in Peru or Chile? Moore admits that his own argument does not translate very easily, if at all, to the history of the countries that he does not specifically analyse. Rueschemeyer et al. do attempt to go beyond Europe, and a significant part of their work is taken up with a discussion of Latin America. As
noted above, these authors conclude in any case that the role of the working class in democratic transitions was much less in Latin America than in Europe. They tend to conclude, therefore, that the democracies
in these countries are less firmly established. It is not clear, however, that the conclusion follows from the argument. It is logically possible that
the different combination of forces that lay behind the stabilisation of democracy in South America (with a far stronger middle-class role) could turn out to be as effective in its own historical context as the very different combination in Europe.
The role of the state
The role of the state in democratisation is more complex. Moore hardly discusses the issue at all. Rueschemeyer et al. suggest that there are two opposite extremes in state–society relations that are detrimental to democratic development.
1. At one extreme, the state can sometimes play an overpowering role and inhibit the development of plural groups within civil society that might, if allowed to do so, press for democratisation. Something of this kind seems to have happened in Mexico, where the co-optation of civil society by a post-revolutionary state has allowed the maintenance of one-party rule until quite recently. Turkey is another country that is sometimes seen as having an overpowering state with regard to civil society, although Turkey (like Mexico) is now a democracy.
2. At the other extreme, it is damaging to have a weak state completely penetrated by powerful social groups or business enterprises. This is because some degree of autonomous law enforcement is necessary to persuade social forces to operate through institutions. Some Central American countries are seen as cases in which an insufficiently autonomous state is an impediment to democratisation.
It would seem clear that, if the state is seen as the private property of an individual ruler or elite group, then the state–government distinction, which is necessary for peaceful political contestation to develop, will be hard to find. On the other hand, effective and tightly run states are not necessarily the enemies of democracy if the state elite itself is clearly pro-democratic.

## Introduction to geopolitics, Chapter 1, Flint, 2021

<aside>
📖

Flint, C. (2021). Introduction to geopolitics. Routledge. Chapter One.

</aside>

Summary

- geopolitics = critical component of human geography
    - geographical factors (place, space, and scale) connected with political power
- geopolitics → not only traditional state actions
    - but also as a dynamic interaction between geopolitical agents (countries, groups, individuals) and structures (geopolitical environments, geographical boundaries, and political systems)
- Notes (chatgpt)
    
    ### **Key Concepts**:
    
    1. **Geopolitics and Human Geography**:
        - **Geopolitics** is framed within the broader discipline of **human geography**, which studies the spatial aspects of human activities. Geography provides unique insights into political processes, especially how territories, borders, and resources shape political decisions.
        - The book uses a **spatial perspective** to analyze world events, focusing on how power dynamics are influenced by geography.
    2. **Place and Space**:
        - **Place** is defined as a unique area with physical and social characteristics that shape people's experiences. Places are **interdependent** with other regions, as the movements of people, capital, and goods link them to global networks.
        - **Space** is broader than place and refers to the abstract layout of political, social, and economic activities. For example, space helps define the **control of territory**, such as military bases or resources.
    3. **Structure and Agency**:
        - **Structure** refers to the external environment, including geographical factors and political systems, that provide both opportunities and constraints for geopolitical agents (countries, groups, etc.).
        - **Agency** refers to the actions and decisions of geopolitical agents that attempt to shape or respond to these structures. Geopolitical choices are shaped by the tension between these structures and agents' capabilities to act.
    4. **Politics of Scale**:
        - **Scale** is the range of spatial levels at which political actions occur, from individual to global levels. Geopolitics operates on multiple scales, such as local, national, and international, with power relationships varying at each level.
        - The concept of **nested scales** is emphasized—actions at a local level (e.g., a protest) can connect to broader national or global scales (e.g., international policies or global movements).
    5. **Geopolitical Agents**:
        - The chapter discusses **geopolitical agents** (countries, national groups, individuals, etc.) as those who ""do"" geopolitics. They act within geopolitical structures, trying to influence or control space, resources, and power.
        - These agents interact with one another, with some having more power than others based on their geographic and political positioning.
    6. **Geopolitical Knowledge**:
        - The chapter introduces the idea that **geopolitical knowledge** is ""situated""—it is shaped by the perspectives and experiences of those creating it. Geopolitical theory, therefore, is influenced by the political and historical context in which it is developed.
    
    ### **Key Quotes**:
    
    - ""Geopolitics is a component of human geography... we must understand it in relation to geography’s influence on political systems and the people who create and engage with them"".
    - ""Places are not isolated but interdependent, and their uniqueness is a product of both internal and external forces"".
    - ""Geopolitics is not just the practice of territorial control; it is also the way of seeing the world"".
    - ""The scale at which we observe political actions changes how we interpret them"".
    
    ### **What the Chapter Contributes to the Field**:
    
    - **Introduction to Geopolitical Theory**: It offers a clear framework for understanding geopolitics, focusing on the interrelationship between geography, politics, and power structures.
    - **Critical Understanding of Current Events**: By applying the concepts of place, scale, structure, and agency, it provides tools to critically examine global conflicts, territorial disputes, and the role of geography in shaping political outcomes.
    - **Feminist Geopolitics**: The chapter introduces feminist perspectives, challenging traditional geopolitics as a masculine practice and emphasizing the need for a more inclusive and complex understanding of global power dynamics.
    

## Russia's perpetual geopolitics: Putin returns to the historical pattern, Kotkin, 2016

<aside>
📖

Kotkin, S. (2016). Russia's perpetual geopolitics: Putin returns to the historical pattern. Foreign Aff., 95, 2.

</aside>

Summary

- historical pattern of Russia’s foreign policy ⇒ “soaring ambitions that have exceeded the country’s capabilities.”
- Notes
    - only three historic wins (Peter the Great, Alexander I, Stalin) → other than that “relatively weak great power”
        - was defeated a lot and lost a lot of former territory → still largest country
        - nowadays territory not as important as economic dynamism and human capital for great power
    - Russia ⇒ “the most corrupt developed country in the world”
        - economic system ⇒ “resource-extracting, rent-seeking”
    - great powers’ exceptionalism
        - “China and the United States have claimed a heavenly mandated exceptionalism”
        - “England and France throughout much of their histories”
        - “Germany and Japan had their exceptionalism bombed out of
        them”
        - “Russia’s is remarkably resilient.” → today “eurasianism”
            - consequence → only joins international bodies if it is granted special privileges as exceptional or dominant member
            - pride within country vs resentment towards West → further alienation (added to institutional divergence due to economic backwardness)
            - fosters national identity
    - borders → always one of Russia’s vulnerabilities
        - ⇒ defensive aggressiveness
        - narrative on how to ensure security → “moving outward, in the name of preempting external attack”
        - independent, smaller countries close to its borders = “potential beachheads for enemies”
    - Russia → always striving for a strong state → hence also guarantee domestic order
        - “The state grew fat, but the people grew lean.”
        - but this goal led to personalism ⇒ risk of conflating state interests with one person’s interests
    - “Russia’s foreign policy orientation, in other words, is as much a condition as a choice”
        - should realise their “unwinnable competition with the West” (excuse me?)
        - should brings its aspirations “in line” with its capabilities (shouldn’t the West, too?)
        - should practice Vergangenheitsbewältigung → regarding losing the Cold War in all instances (political, economic, cultural, technological, and military)
        - Russia needs more than just hard power
    - argues that
        - Russia “is not, and it has no near- or medium-term
        prospect of becoming” equal to US, EU, China
        - Russia needs internal restructuring ⇒ “transparent, competent, and accountable government; a real civil service; a genuine parliament; a professional and impartial judiciary; free and professional media; and a vigorous, nonpolitical crackdown on corruption”

</aside>

Summary

- need to rethink the geopolitics of energy security
- need more voices → multidimensional concept and many major contemporary challenges
- Notes
    - geopolitics of global energy security ⇒ influence of geographical factors, such as the distribution of centres of supply and demand, on state and non-state actions to ensure adequate, affordable and reliable supplies of energy
    - major issues in global energy security
        - energy = “security issue” (Proninska 2007)
        - the US addiction to imported oil
            - USA = world’s largest energy producer, consumer and net importer
            - Carter Doctrine: ensures control and protection of Persian Gulf region
            - Iraq War → “all about oil” (Harvey, 2003)
            - “America is addicted to oil, which is often from unstable parts of the world” (Bush, 2006)
            - US military → now focused on “resource wars” to ensure access to oil (Klare, 2008)
        - the European Union’s reliance on natural gas imports from Russia
            - only have limited domestic gas production and as demand rises, dependency on Russia increases, too
            - Russia’s gas export policy → suspect to clear geopolitical dimensions (Belkin, 2008)
            - lots of disputes between Russia and Ukraine → affecting gas delivery to Europe
            - gas price determination ⇒ soft power weapon
        - China’s strategy of ‘going out’ to secure equity oil in Africa
            - “scramble for africa” 2.0 → Western countries encourage Africa to use resources and develop vs China’s “package deals” and non-interference
                - China’s strategy → very attractive for oil-rich African countries (Mohan and Power, 2008)
                - lots of accusations of Chinese misbehaviour by the West but very hypocrytical!
                    - actually Chinese national oil companies are increasing global oil supply by encouraging developing countries to produce oil and hence foster development
    - “The world’s energy system is at a crossroads. Current global trends in energy supply and consumption are patently unsustainable – environmentally, economically, socially” (IEA, 2008a, 37)
    - growing mismatch between the geographies of supply and demand
    - need to rethink the geopolitics of energy security.
        - energy security → very diverse issue ⇒ each case has its own critical factors
        - energy security ⇒ multidimensional concept
        - should be considered in relation to climate change policy

</aside>

Summary

- foreign policy ⇒ “inherently geopolitical”
- construction of 'space ' and' place ' in foreign policy
- Notes
    - places and spaces either considered good or evil → notion contributed by critical geopolitics
    - foreign policy ⇒ “inherently geopolitical” → “construction of meaning and values of spaces and places”
        - geography = crucial
        - foreign policy → demarcates and defines geography (not primordial or natural) → created through linguistics and policies
    - state's privileged story tellers ⇒ experts (academics), foreign policy professionals
    and media people
    - metaphor of script (O'Tuathail and Agnew, 1992)
        - script ⇒ “set of representations, a collection of descriptions, attributes and scenarios deemed necessary to define a place”
        - → everything is constantly re-written
        - nonetheless, consumers want to have “sequentially ordered plot” and clearly defined characters
        - state identities (domestic) in relation to the other/ foreign
    - need generalisations to explain in a constructive way but those generalised labels should always be contested
        - Gulf War: evil Saddam Hussein vs good USA (employed images of WWII)
        - labels “transform places into singular and predictable unit”
        - O'Tuathail and Agnew (1992, 202) → 'The **irony of practical geographical representations of place** is that, in order to succeed, they actually necessitate the **abrogation of genuine geographical knowledge** about the diversity and complexity of places as social entities
            - would not work with displaying full information → need simplifications that fit your storytelling

</aside>

Summary

- expansion of US judicial power
    - from solely domestic issues to transnational economic relations ⇒ involves foreign governments beyond official U.S. borders
    - ⇒ “expansion of judicial territory” → particularly Global South
    - tool in the consolidation of U.S. economic and geopolitical power
- hegemonic relations → US expansion = restriction of other countries’ sovereignty
    - US legal practices ⇒ perpetuate an unequal global economic order
- “The executive remains wedded overall to the judicial power it helped develop.”
- law = tool of geopolitics → as seen in US case
- Notes
    - public-political (sovereign) conflicts are reclassified as solely (private-)commercial
    - transnational economic governance → rise of neoliberal economy
    - US commercial law and legal practices → maintain and reinforce US hegemony
        - blurred lines between imperialism and hegemony (Anderson, 2017)
            - both consent and coercion are used (Anderson, 2017)
    - expanding US judicial territory → both good for US and transnational capitalism
        - US law → “most capital- and creditor-friendly law in the world”(with English law)
        - expansion of judicial power → to protect US interests from sovereign challenges
            - consequence ⇒ furthered “the continued extraction of resources
            from Global South to Global North”
    - judicial historical amnesia → forget about past cases and extended power remains unchallenged
        - now foreign governments obeying to US judiciary is expected → result of a long history of gradually expanding judicial reach
    - question of how to deal with this expansion in the future → other countries are following this lead and americanising (Putnam, 2009)
    - law = tool of geopolitics → as seen in US case

- structure → geopolitical
    - resources, location, geography, human factors (⇒ constructs = balance of power), space vs place, energy
- difference between land and sea power → influence from Athens vs Sparta

# Topic overview

The bureaucratic approach to analysing foreign policy was pioneered by Graham Allison (yes, the same Allison of the Thucydides Trap). Unlike most foreign policy approaches we have looked at, the bureaucratic approach does not consider the State to be a unitary actor. Rather it imagines it as a number of competing entities within a State. Foreign Policy is consequently a result of negotiation between competing parts.

Allison based his analysis on the study of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and is subsequently focused largely on the US. We will continue this focus by considering this analysis of US foreign policy and the criticisms of it.

making
- discuss the critiques levelled against bureaucratic politics.
</aside>

- influence of the institutions of foreign policy making ⇒ ministries of foreign affairs, defence and trade
- bureaucratic politics model
    - interplay between leaders, bureaucratic actors, organisational culture (+ political actors outside the formal apparatus of the state)
    - “middle-level-theory”
    - analytical focus ⇒ state + institutions of decision-making
        - instead of narrow on individuals or big on the international system as a whole
    - set the stage for a broader consideration of influences on foreign policy →  eg role of interest groups, constitutional structures, societal values and even culture
- Allison’s *Essence of Decision* (1999) ⇒ FPA of Kennedy administration’s decision-making during Cuban Missile Crisis
    - rational actor model
        - rational calculation of self-interest
        - state = unitary actor
        - decision based on near-perfect information
    - organisational process model
        - ‘feudalist structure’ of decision-making ⇒ different institutions within the government operate internally following a hierarchy
            - based upon set routines (‘standard operating procedures’) ⇒ backbone of all FP decisions
        - different decision making bodies are autonomous bodies → little cross-communication
            - solely focus on their own institutional interests → decisions = product of organisational needs
        - foreign policy making bodies ⇒ autonomous + unable to develop a policy stance that is outside of their narrow set of institutional interests.
    - bureaucratic politics model ⇒ policy outcomes are shaped by internal competition among government departments for influence and resource
        - bureaucracies are in competition with each other on access to the head of state and for resources from the central government
        - bureaucratic actors who articulate their positions effectively and who have privileged relations with the head of state ⇒ will most likely shape foreign policy
        - leader’s importance → due to them being the final source of decision-making (⇒ not because of their contributions or so)
        - ⇒ should consider here also party politics → another nonrational aspect!!
- implications of bureaucratic model
    - “faceless bureaucrats” have more power than elected officials ⇒ questions existence of democratic control
    - decisions depend on both political skills of bureaucrats + objective assessments
    - sources of influence on foreign policy go beyond the state → eg intergovernmental organisations and non-state actors, eg multinational corporations, NGOs, etc
- criticisms of bureaucratic model
    - great overlap between organisational and bureaucratic model
        - how are autonomous institutions pursuing particular
        interests significantly distinct from the bureaucratic competition
            - Allison himself eventually admitted the similarities between the two models were greater than their differences and went on to merge them in later accounts.
    - overstate bureaucratic competition
        - most likely, like-minded individuals are appointed to key administrative positions → result: rather bureaucratic conformity instead of conflict
    - overlook individual bureaucrats’ complex motives ⇒ yes, they are bound by administrative pressures from above + pre-established routines but remain individuals with complex identities
        - go beyond the anonymity of the ‘organisation man’ → can act against their institutions, eg because of self-interest or patriotism
    - need to go beyond the Western context → more nuanced understanding
        - Allison → elevated US experience to FPA generally
        - depended on a lot of factors which can be very diverse ⇒ eg administrative capacity, socio-cultural factors
        - new analysis of other cases
            - Houghton (2001) ⇒ Iran
            - Thies (2012) ⇒ more nuanced analysis following criticisms

Summary

- Government decisions are not made by a single rational entity but are the result of bargaining between various political actors and bureaucracies.
- Key decision-makers are driven by organisational, political, and personal interests, rather than purely national interest calculations.
- Government actions are shaped by intra-bureaucratic struggles, standard operating procedures (SOPs), and constraints imposed by organisational structures.
- Notes
    - government actions ⇒ result of bargaining among players positioned hierarchically in the government
        - “Internal politics is messy”
        - state ≠ unified rational actor → internal bureaucratic struggles
    - unit of analysis ⇒ actions of a government = acts of officials of a government in exercises of governmental authority that can be perceived outside the government
    - action channels ⇒ “regularized sets of procedures for producing particular classes of actions”
    - players ⇒ senior political figures, heads of organizations, and other individuals who influence governmental decisions and actions
    - organising concepts
        1. Who plays?
            1. central circle of senior players
        2. What determines each player’s stand?
            1. their position → interests
                1. national security interests, 
                2. organizational interests, 
                3. domestic interests,  
                4. personal interests
            2. personal interests and how they perceive their own role
            3. how they perceive the issue → “face of the issue”
        3. How are players’ stands aggregated to yield governmental decisions and actions? 
            1. influenced by bargaining advantages, skills, will, and other players' perceptions
    - the larger the number of actors involved, the less coherent government action will be
    - constraints on the bureaucratic politics game
        - organisational processes ⇒ structures + set routines
            - → “standard operating procedures”
        - information processing biased by bureaucratic filters
        - shared values
    - nations can influence each other ⇒ “pulling and hauling among individuals with differing perceptions and stakes”
        - nation's actions ⇒  mix of routine behaviours, maneuvers in decision games, actions by players in the absence of decisions, and actions following decisions related to influencing the other nation
        - eg Cuban Missile Crisis ⇒ was shaped not just by Kennedy or Khrushchev’s decisions, but also by bureaucratic constraints and miscommunications within both governments
        - diplomatic crises often escalate due to bureaucratic miscalculations rather than intentional signalling

Summary

- government failures should not be blamed on managerial inertia (bureaucracies) but rather lack of cohesive values and objectives
- presidential authority
- Notes
    - failure of US government ⇒ should not be blamed on “inertia of a large bureaucratic machine” but on
    - objectives ⇒ “reflection of values, of beliefs concerning what man and society ought to be”
    - bureaucratics model ⇒  ""misleading, dangerous, and compelling”
        - undermines accountability → deterministic
        - Inertia ⇒ bureaucracies tend to be rigid and resistant to change due to the need for standard operating procedures and division of labor
        - suboptimal solutions ⇒ due to the high costs of coordination and information search, bureaucracies often settle for satisfactory rather than optimal solutions
        - distortions ⇒ Standard operating procedures (SOPs) can introduce distortions by presenting some options more clearly than others, and by making some policy options easier to implement than others
    - role of leadership
        - lack of decisive action often results from a lack of clear objectives and values among leaders rather than bureaucratic inertia
    - bureaucratic interests ≠ main drivers of policy
    - president = most powerful actor
        - appointing bureau chiefs ⇒ presidents select individuals who share their values to head the major bureaucracies
        - structuring action channels ⇒ presidents influence who has access to decision-making processes through their selection of advisors and allocation of tasks
        - influencing bureaucratic interests ⇒ president has direct impact on bureaucratic interests through budget control, defining the scope of an organisations activities, and through public statements
        - policy is ultimately a function of the values of decision-makers
    - Cuban missile crisis ⇒ determined by President Kennedy's values, not bureaucratic politics

Summary

- analyses impact of bureaucratic politics on decision-making process of the Obama Administration to intervene in Libya in March 2011
    - only mixed empirical support
    - partly shaped by bureaucratic politics,
    - but personal ideology, Obama’s leadership, and external factors played a crucial role.
- BPM helps explain bureaucratic conflict but does not fully capture high-stakes crisis decision-making.
- Notes
    - BPM model → mixed evidence for explaining Libya intervention
        - stand-sit proposition ⇒ fulfilled
            - = policy preferences stem from bureaucratic roles
            - → “Where you stand depends on where you sit” (BPM principle applied to bureaucratic roles).
        - bargaining propositon ⇒ fulfilled
            - = decision-making processes are characterised best as political bargaining processes (→ “pulling and hauling”)
        - resultant proposition ⇒ UNfulfilled
            - outcomes of the bargaining processes are unintended compromise solutions that no actor originally pursued
            - ⇒ result = not a compromise but a win for the interventionists
    - Opposition to intervention: Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen, National Security Advisor Thomas Donilon, Vice President Joe Biden, and other senior figures argued against intervention.
    - Advocates for intervention: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice, NSC advisors Samantha Power and Ben Rhodes, and a group of humanitarian interventionists.
    - Obama’s role: Acted as his own key decision-maker, balancing opposing arguments before siding with interventionists
    - in crisis decision-making processes → importance of personality and ideology!!
        - → Allison exaggerated the importance of bureaucratic logic
        - still a discrepancy between world view and bureaucratic position
    - role of president
        - Obama “was the supreme player and highly involved in the decision-making process”
            - nonetheless, bureaucratic influences
        - was an issue of such high importance that president was attentive and did not allow for bureaucracies being able to establish policies independently
    - argue that Libyan intervention example rather follows Krasner’s (1976) argumentation

# Seminar Notes

This week we will have an academic debate between Allison and Krasner.

- does Krasner even actually criticise Allison → not more just shining light on the dangers of blaming bureaucracy
    - need to take action against it
- Krasner
    - analytical weakness → presidential power
        - president picks people → like-minded
        - normative interests still matter → president’s personal preferences
    - normative argument
        - government blaming the system, Bank of England, groupthink
        - impression: democracy don’t work if it is only done solely by unelected officials (bureaucrats)
        - eg Liz Truss
- choice models
    - state A vs state B → conversation
    - BPM → within the state, politics shaped by internal debate, state B ⇒ passive, only an external factor/ impactor, causes not actors (≠ not a conversation partner)
    - ⇒ shift in cognitive focus
- krasner vs allison
    - difference in interpreting the scope of the president’s responsibilities
- essay
    - BPM ⇒ purely US
    - OR krasner vs allison through cuban missile crisis
    - OR krasner vs allison via trump
        - “adults of the room” → bureaucrats balancing out trump
        - now trump with musk, etc → unelected king
        - utilise: Drezner, D. W. (2020). Immature leadership: Donald Trump and the American presidency. *International Affairs*, *96*(2), 383-400
    - other theories to employ in essays
        - PHT → first stage is done by institutional, bureaucratic limitations
        - principal agent theory → need bureaucrats to make efficient and informed decisions

Summary

- need leaders and their individual influences for FPA
- Notes
    - why individuals are disregarded in PS
        - don’t matter
        - might matter from time to time → but not relevant for generalisations that are created in PS
        - study of individuals = hopeless due to several objections made by scholars
    - study of individuals = ignored in IR
        - exceptions: Machiavelli, Kissinger, etc
        - Waltz → Man, the State, and War ⇒ rejects image/ importance of the man
            - human nature = constant, but state nature not ⇒ human nature = always for war but states not
                - BUT human nature ≠ constant ⇒ variable
            - parsimony is not better than accuracy
            - state intentions ARE important → and leaders influence these, so are also important
    - case studies to prove importance of leaders:
        1. Germany under Hitler;
            1. Hitler ⇒ responsible for start of WWII and Germany’s defeat
                1. was against will of the Germans and his allies and opposition
        2. the contrasting impact of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and Kaiser Wilhelm II on European
        politics; 
            1. balance of power ⇒ success or failure depending on leader
            2. Bismarck ⇒ peacemaking, status quo
            3. Wilhelm II ⇒ aggressive, revisionist
            4. alliances and image outside ⇒ dependent on leader
        3. France under Napoleon Bonaparte; 
        4. a comparison of Iraq under Saddam Hussein and Syria under Hafiz al-Asad; 
        5. the behaviour of Iran in its war with Iraq under Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
            1. continued Iran-Iraq War because he just could not give up
    - hypotheses to prove impact of individuals
        - foundational hypotheses on the impact of individuals
        1. individuals set the ultimate and secondary intentions of a state
        2. individuals can be an important component of a state’s diplomatic influence and military power
        3. individual leaders shape their state’s strategies
        4. individual leaders affect the behaviour of opposing states that must react to leaders’ idiosyncratic intentions and capabilities
        - eg the future of China → need to understand the leaders to understand China’s future
        - hypotheses on personality traits
        1. states led by risk-tolerant leaders are more likely to cause wars
        2. states led by delusional leaders start wars and prolong them unnecessarily
        3.  states led by leaders with grandiose visions are more likely to destabilise the system
        4. states led by predictable leaders will have stronger and more enduring alliances
        - might be difficult right now to measure personality traits → still possible, we also found ways to measure identity, culture, etc
        - matter enabling factors ⇒ when do leaders have a greater impact following certain bureaucratic, systemic, cultural, or other factors
        1. the more power is concentrated in the hands of an individual leader, the greater the influence of that leader’s personality and preferences
        2. individuals are more important when systemic, domestic and bureaucratic forces conflict or are ambiguous
        3. individuals are more important when circumstances are fluid
    - danger of “cult of inevitability” → also influenced by leader’s decisions
    - there are useful generalisations on leader’s behaviour and its consequences (see hypotheses)
    - nonetheless, need to study all levels of IR ⇒ man, state and war

Hill, 2003 - Chapter 5

Summary

- ends and means easily get blurred → so need to constantly reflect and be self-aware
- need flexi-planning ⇒ broad strategies without specifying too much detail and too strong commitments to things not working out
- rationality = needed in limitation ⇒ “vital background value”
- Notes
    - rationality ≠ realism
        - realism ⇒ state security = criterion for decision-making
        - rationality ⇒ state = unitary decision-maker, no criterion
    - procedural vs substantive rationality
        - = process vs outcome rationality
        - procedural ⇒ finding the best means
        - substantive ⇒ finding the “correct” outcome
        - should not be divided but they are interrelated
    - individual vs collective
        - starts with individual but ends with collective decision-making
        - question: do all partake in rational decision-making?
        - so many inputs / participants
    - efficiency vs democracy
        - need for democratic legitimacy
        - have to strike a balance between efficiency and fulfilling sense of democracy
    - normative vs positive
        - distinction between “is” and “ought”
    - bounded rationality (Simon, 1974)
        - realistically one does not maximise one’s values but rather “satisfice” (= accept ouctome which approximates with one’s preferences)
        - → be a “good enough” politician (Bettelheim, 1978) ⇒ balance between efficiency and democracy
        - some goals are just unattainable
        - “disjointed incrementalism” = “muddling through” ⇒ changing policy via small steps instead of grand transformations, more short-term
        - both bounded rationality and disjointed incrementalism are limited ⇒ does not allow for redirection or criticism of the general strategy
    - non-decisions
        - ⇒  decision not to act
        - ⇒ failure to act
        - ⇒ exclusion of certain choices
    - historical thinking
        - danger ⇒ use of over-simple historical comparisons and analogies
        - kinds of legacies
            - those deeply engrained in institutions, thinking, etc
            - those deeply rooted but with potential to be turned around within a generation
            - those relatively recent, superficially established → can be managed easily
    - politicians ⇒ follow their “subjective versions of the national interest”
    - how goals should be done
        - with a time-frame
        - explicitly
            - either taken for granted
            - idea floats around but not hope of actual realisation
            - consciously pushed for
        - which values at stake → why is it one’s goal?
    - substantive rationality ⇒ not realisable
    - maybe better to not pretend to be rational but just exclude irrational options
        - + “cut out sloppiness and narcissism”
    - politicians ⇒ dual responsibility
        - to their citizens
        - to international society
    - ends and means easily get blurred → so need to constantly reflect and be self-aware
    - need flexi-planning ⇒ broad strategies without specifying too much detail and too strong commitments to things not working out
        - need general openness due to IR’s unpredictability
        - but also need a general direction
        - rationality = needed in limitation ⇒ “vital background value”

</aside>

Summary

- groupthink influenced decision-making after 9/11 (Bush Administration)
- criticises unreflected expansion of presidential power
- gives policy recommendations
- Notes
    - groupthink = “mode of thinking in which group members’ ideas and opinions begin to converge and they begin to ignore alternative courses of action as a result of striving for unanimity” → Janis (1982)
        - occurs when “group members “work closely together, share the same values, and above all face a crisis situation in which everyone is subjected to stresses that generate a
        strong need for affiliation.””
        - the more unity and amiability there is, the higher the risk for groupthink
    - causes for groupthink
        - group cohesiveness ⇒ necessary condition
            - ⇒ want to belong, solidarity and positive feelings for the group
            - high level of trust
            - external stress → crisis
        - EITHER structural faults within the group or organisation
            - isolation of the group
            - impartial leadership
            - no norms in decision-making methodology
            - high degree of homogeneity
                - more likely for common ideology
                - low level of heterogeneity → less creativity and diversity in terms of ideas
        - OR provocative situational context
            - high levels of external stress
            - low hopes of arriving
            - internal threats ⇒ “temporary lowering of self-esteem”
                - recent failures, the group is responsible for
                - too difficult choices → too big of a challenge
                - moral dilemma → only choices would violate ethical conduct
                - internal stress can be reduced if group confidence is strengthened via a unanimous decision → induces groupthink
    - symptoms (Janis, 1982)
        - illusion of invulnerability
        - unquestioned belief in the group’s morality
        - collective rationalisation efforts
        - stereotypes of outsiders
        - self-censorship
        - illusion of unanimity
        - direct pressure on dissenters
        - self-appointed “mindguards”
        - if all or most of the above symptoms apply → groupthink will probably happen
    - effects
        - might have positive effects but negative > positive
        - ineffectiveness
        - failure to achieve objectives
        - seven major negative effects on the
        decision-making process:
            1. incomplete survey of alternatives
            2. ncomplete survey of objectives
            3. failure to examine risks of preferred choice
            4. failure to reappraise initially rejected alternatives
            5. poor information search
            6. selective bias in processing information at hand
            7. failure to work out contingency plans
    - prevention
        - even if group cohesiveness is an antedecent for groupthink, it should not be eliminated → non-cohesion will have the same adverse effects as groupthink
            - need moderate level of group cohesion
        - moderate level of heterogeneity
        - structural faults and situational context are difficult to prevent and control
        - hence Janis (1982) → recommendations
            - all group members = critical evaluators
            - have a “devil’s advocate” to reflect on policy choices → role is rotated
            - encourage criticism
            - need impartial leader
            - have independent sub-groups for decision-making
            - ask for outside views from “trusted associates” and experts
            - have “second chance” meetings → another opportunity to criticise and second guess
    - Presidential foreign policy decision making ⇒ president + his/ her advisers
        - + outsiders, congress, the public, the press → depending on context
        - president = group leader
            - ⇒ ultimately responsible
            - rules over final decisions and rules of decision-making
    - groupthink and wartime
        - for USA ⇒ war = almost indefinitely
            - almost always involved in some sort of conflict or war
        - question whether in war, the law is different
            - if endless war → endless different law?
        - cannot afford that presidents are able to expand their power in times of war if we default have war…
        - wartime = provocative situational context
            - if wartime = indefinite, higher chance for groupthink
            - president with increased power → advisors more willing to fall into trap of groupthink
    - group members influence decision-making
        - presidential advisers most often motivated by pleasing the president and “being on the winning side” (Redd, ??)
    - outsiders - congress, the public, and the press → help check the power and reduce groupthink
    - Bush administration
        - symptoms
            - Illusion of Invulnerability
            - Unquestioned Belief in the Group’s Morality
            - Collective Rationalization Efforts
            - Stereotypes of Rivals
            - Self-Censorship
            - Illusion of Unanimity
            - Direct Pressure on Dissenters
            - Self-Appointed “Mindguards”
    - Obama administration
        - anti-groupthink decision-making practices
            - Building Moderate Cohesiveness
            - Roles of Critical Evaluator Assigned to Each Member
            - Leader’s Impartiality at the Outset
            - Consultation with Trusted Outsiders
            - Consultation with Outside Experts
            - “Second Chance” Meeting for Expression of Doubts
    - president failures due to
        - unaware of danger of groupthink and hence no prevention
        - aware of and tries to prevent it but not successfully
        - aware but costs of prevention too high
        - → should not all be left to president ⇒ should be other checks as well
    - hybrid checks
        - inter-agency process → check by other agencies
        - intra-agency process → within agency, different decisions are getting circulated
        - agency or lawyer culture
            - agency culture ⇒ institutional self-awareness of its professionalism
            - lawyer culture ⇒ competency and adherence to rules and laws, trying to be objective
        - public humiliation
    - external checks!!

---    - Janis and Mann (1977) ⇒ “motivational” model of foreign policy → leader = emotional beings
        - emotions = most important in a crisis
        - stress ⇒ “causes lack of ability to abstract and tolerate ambiguity, as well as an increased tendency towards aggressive behaviour”, “tunnel vision”
    - leaders motivated by power ⇒ confrontational foreign policy
    - leaders motivated by interpersonal trust ⇒ conciliatory foreign policy
    - leaders utilise nationalist aggressive foreign policy to divert from pressing domestic problems
        - Bush → Iraq war
    - different leadership styles (Orbovich and Molnar, 1992)
        - systemic (rationalist, cost-benefit calculation)
        - speculative (context oriented)
        - judicial (task oriented)
        - intuitive (relies on non-rational approach, “hunches”)
- discussion of group vs individual decision-making
    - groups → more people involved, less individual misperceptions
    - Janis (1982) → “group think” ⇒ “individuals seek to maintain consensus when in a group” = will discard their own preferences if the group thinks differently
        - risk of dilution or abandonment of objectively best (“optimal”) decision → in strive for common group position
        - happens especially when time is an issue
    - within a group, individuals will also consider how a potential solution will affect their status in the group rather than the general matter
    - to ameliorate “group think” → have a “devil’s advocate” (George, 1972)
    - Hart, Stern and Sundelius (1997) → not always “group think” but rather better explained by ‘new group syndrome’ and lack of assertive leadership

exam questions:
1. What is bureaucratic politics and how does it impact upon foreign policy?
2. Compare and contrast Allison’s models of foreign policy decision-making."
"Note that H(w) is decreasing in w. Now, if unemployed workers choose a reservation wage, w*, then, given that a fraction, p, of the unem- ployed receive a job offer and that a fraction, H(w*), of those receiving an offer are offered a wage greater than w*, the portion of the unemployed who will be employed next period will be the fraction who receive a wage offer at or above their reservation wage. Therefore, the flow of workers from unemployment to employment will be UpH(w*). explain in three bullet points"
"Consider two firms that produce a homogeneous good and compete by setting
quantities. Suppose that firm 1 has a cost function C1(q) = 100 + 5q, and that firm

(a) Assuming that they choose their quantities simultaneously, determine their
equilibrium quantities, price and profits.
(b) Assuming that firm 1 chooses its quantity first, determine the equilibrium
quantities, price and profits.
(c) Assuming that firm 2 chooses its quantity first, determine the equilibrium
quantities, price and profits.
(a) The marginal cost is the same across firms, hence the outcome is symmetric, only profits differ.
The best response function of firm 1 is:

Imposing symmetry:
q1 = q2 = 100/3.
The market price is P = 115/3.

(d) Define the demand multiplier and the total government expenditure multiplier.Provide equations of them. The Equilibrium Effects of a Temporary Increase in G: Stimulus, the Multiplier, and Crowding Out
LO 11.7 Use the real intertemporal model to explain the effects of particular shocks to the economy.
This may seem like ground we have covered already, as we analyzed the effects of a change in government purchases in the one-period model in Chapter 5. There we learned that there is an income effect of government spending that acts to increase labor supply and output, and that government spending acts to crowd out private consumption. The real intertemporal model allows us to move on from these basic insights and learn something new. First, the model shows how the intertemporal choices of consumers affect the econ- omy’s response to a change in government spending. An increase in G will act to increase the real interest rate, and this will introduce additional crowding-out effects on private spending working through both investment and consumption. Further, there will be an intertemporal substitution effect on labor supply as a result of the interest rate increase. Second, we will be able to study in detail the workings of expenditure multipliers, which can play an important role in macroeconomic policymaking. The multiplier is the ratio of the response of output to an initial change in government spending, for example.
We will model a temporary increase in government spending as an increase in G, the quantity of government purchases in the current period, leaving future government pur- chases, G′, unchanged. When would the government choose to increase its expenditures on goods and services temporarily? An important example is a war. Typically, wars are known to be temporary (though their length can be uncertain), and the government com- mits spending to the war effort that will not remain in place when the war is over. Another example of an explicitly temporary change in government spending was the spending program contained in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009.
We will suppose that government spending in the current period increases from G1 to G2, and we would first like to determine how large the resulting shift in the out- put demand curve will be. For convenience, assume that the marginal propensity to consume, MPC, is a constant, implying that the curve in Figure 11.18 is linear. This will also imply that the shift to the right in the output demand curve, which we will denote by ∆, will be the same for any real interest rate r.
The quantity ∆ is the total change in the demand for goods, which will come from three sources: (i) the direct effect of the change in government spending, G2 - G1; (ii) the effect on consumption from the increase in taxes (in the present or the future) required to finance the government spending increase; and (iii) the effect on consumption from the increase in ∆, which the representative consumer will see as an increase in income. To determine the second effect, from the present-value government budget constraint,
   
                A Real Intertemporal Model with Investment Chapter 11 435
 Equation (11-18), the increase in the present value of taxes for the consumer must be equal to G2 - G1, the increase in government spending, and so the effect on the demand for consumption goods will be -MPC(G2 - G1), since the marginal propensity to consume tells us how much the demand for consumption goods changes with a one-unit change in lifetime wealth. For the third effect, the change in demand for consumption goods is MPC∆, since an increase in current income of ∆ units increases the demand for consump- tion goods by MPC∆ units. Then, the total increase in demand for goods is determined by
∆ = G2 - G1 - MPC(G2 - G1) + MPC∆. (11-20)
Note that ∆ appears on both sides of Equation (11-20), because an increase in ∆, through its effect on the demand for consumption goods, produces more demand for consumption goods—a multiplier effect. But how large is that multiplier? If we solve Equation (11-20) for ∆, we get
∆ = G2 - G1.
Then, let md denote the demand multiplier, which is the ratio of ∆ to the increase in
government expenditure, so
md = G2 - G1 = 1,
 G2 - G1
and the demand multiplier is one. That is, total demand for goods increases by exactly the amount of the increase in government spending, and the shift to the right in the output demand curve is also the increase in government spending, G2 - G1.
Before the increase in current government purchases, G, in Figure 11.22, the economy is in equilibrium with a current real wage, w1, current employment, N1, current output, Y1, and real interest rate, r1. When G increases, this will have two effects, one on output supply and one on output demand. We have determined the effect on output demand, which is a shift to the right in the output demand curve, from Yd1 to Yd2, where the horizontal shift is equal to the increase in G. Since lifetime wealth decreases due to the increase in the present value of taxes, leisure will decrease (leisure is a normal good) for the representative consumer, given the current real wage, and so the labor supply curve in Figure 11.22(a) shifts to the right from Ns1(r1) to Ns2(r1), and the output supply curve in Figure 11.22(b) shifts to the right from Ys1 to Ys2.
To determine all the equilibrium effects by using the model, we start first with Figure 11.22(b). It is clear that current aggregate output must increase, as both the output demand and output supply curves shift to the right, and so Y increases from Y1 to Y2. It may appear that the real interest rate may rise or fall; however, there is strong theoretical support for an increase in the real interest rate. This is because the temporary increase in government spending should lead to only a small decrease in lifetime wealth for the consumer, which will produce a small effect on labor supply. Therefore, there should be only a small shift to the right in the Ys curve, and the real interest rate will rise, as in Figure 11.22(b).
What is the total government expenditure multiplier here, by which we mean the ratio of the equilibrium increase in real output to the increase in government

                
436 Part IV Savings, Investment, and Government Deficits Figure 11.22 A Temporary Increase in Government Purchases
The increase in G shifts the labor supply curve to the right, the output supply curve to the right, and the output demand curve to the right. The real interest rate rises, and aggregate output increases in equilibrium. There is an additional shift to the right in the labor supply curve because of the increase in r, so employment rises and the real wage falls in equilibrium.

spending? Since the output demand curve in Figure 11.22(b) shifted to the right by the increase in government spending, the equilibrium increase in current output must be less than the increase in government spending. The total multiplier is less than one, and it will become smaller as the size of the wealth effect on labor supply falls (this makes the rightward shift in the output supply curve smaller), and as the intertempo- ral substitution effect of the real interest rate on labor supply falls (this makes the output supply curve steeper).
Some economists have argued that the government expenditure multiplier can be greater than one, particularly during a recession. These arguments typically rely on the existence of some form of economic inefficiency, for example sticky wages and prices, as in some forms of Keynesian analysis, or the failure of consumers to take account of the effects of the increase in future taxes needed to pay off the government debt. In Chapters 13 and 14, we will analyze Keynesian mechanisms, and show how this makes a difference.
What happens to current consumption in Figure 11.22? If the real interest rate did not change in equilibrium (e.g., if the output supply curves were horizontal), we know from the figure that real income would increase by an amount equal to the increase in government spending. If this occurred, then the change in the consumer’s lifetime wealth would be zero, since the increase in the present value of taxes is equal to the increase in current income. As a result, current consumption would be unchanged."

Increasingly, feminist bureaucrats, politicians, activists and

scrutinises claims to the feminist actorsness of the EU by
introducing the analytical concept of Feminist Power Europe

adopt a FFP that upholds transformative potential of feminism.
Undertaking critical content analysis of key documents, we
identify three overarching feminist frames that emerge in the
EU’s external policies: (1) Liberal; (2) Intersectional; (3)
Postcolonial. We demonstrate that the EU’s propensity for a
transformative feminist foreign policy is limited by the setup of
global politics and the main drivers of European integration,
which continue to be situated in a traditionally masculine
environment and are de ned by prevailing hierarchies. In
undertaking this work, we highlight the constraints of advocating
for the EU to adopt a FFP. This paper concludes by cautioning

Democracy and its Critics 

-	only through engagement with democracy’s critics a more compelling and sophisticated “theory of democracy” can be developed
-	democracy can mean at least 5 different things:
1.	a distinctive set of pol. institutions and practices 
2.	a particular body of rights
3.	a social and economic order
4.	a system that ensures desirable results
5.	or a unique process of making collective and binding decisions

-	understands that democracy is primarily a process of making collective and binding decisions 
-	stressed, though, that this conception of democracy has “strong implications for the others” 
-	seeks to construct a more robust foundation no which to build democracy
-	democracy is fundamentally about participation in the political process
psychologically + socially crucial part of human existence => what it means to be “fully human”
-	dem. process allows for participation =>thus satisfies a basic human need for self-determination 

-	vision of dem. based on four essential concepts: 

1.	Equality (“idea of strong equality”)
intrinsic equality: deeply entrenched in “our” morality + culture but suffers from grave weaknesses => we need to come to ‘strong equality’
other “human needs” are served by democracy better than by other forms of government:
1.	Dem. as instrumental to maximum feasible freedom
2.	Dem. as instrumental to human development
3.	Dem. as instrumental to protection of personal interests 
gives human beings quality without which they “cease to be fully human and in the total absence of which they would not be human at all” 

2.	Personal Autonomy (“presumption of personal autonomy”)
key to arrive to strong equality
one is the best judge of one’s interests, the other is always in disadvantaged position:
does not know your interests (epistemological); does not pursue your interests (historical)
you should have the right to judge whether a policy is/is not in your own best interest
doesn’t conclude that one always gets what they want, but means that no one can take away your right to say that this is what you want (rejection of guardianship)

3.	Procedural guarantees 
D. setting out “ideal standards” for the dem. process, which would “be a perfect democratic process”
calls the more realistic version of a perfect dem. process a “polyarchy”
5 criteria
1.	Effective Participation
2.	Voting Equality at the Decisive State
3.	Enlightened Understanding
4.	Control of the Agenda
5.	Inclusivity of the Demos
=>constitute a system that makes the system democratic and in line with strong equality
ideal standards culminate in “equal opportunity”
•	what emerges when 5 criteria are at least approximated
•	end result of the dem. process 

4.	Radical Notion of Dem. Inclusiveness 
Who has the rightful claim to be in the demos? What might be reasonable justifications for exclusion of the demos?
Inclusion for Dahl: to have the rights of a citizen =>participation rights
discussed Schumpeter, Rousseau, Locke, Mill; all have impoverished notion of inclusion (according to Dahl)
“The demos must include all adult members of the association except transients and persons improved to be mentally defective” (+ children)

-Criticism

-	for D. presumption of personal autonomy is not absolute (“it admits exceptions”), since burden of proof lies with the other 
-	if this is true, then the question is what “the other” must do to prove that they are better equipped to know and defend your interests 
Dahl: historical record rules this out
-	≠ Schumpeter & Brennan: so many people are ignorant and not knowledgeable, therefore they don’t know what is good for them
=> maybe an implicit claim in their theories, that they are able to prove that others ar less ignorant"

"High levels of party cohesion are possible in parliamentary systems as
a result of a combination of incentives to encourage supporting the
party leadership and disincentives for rebelling against the leadership,
or what are known as carrots and sticks. Benedetto and Hix (2007)
have explored these in-depth in the case of the Westminster parliament.
The primary incentive that party leaderships can offer is promotion
from the backbenches of the legislature to a cabinet position. In fact, in
almost all parliamentary systems there has been a steady expansion of
the size of the executive in the post-Second World War period in part
to allow the government to offer more promotion opportunities to their
parliamentarians and thus ensure their loyalty. Disincentives can also
be used to enforce party cohesion and the ultimate disincentive which
governments use is to attach a vote of no confidence to a proposed bill.
In other words, the government tells parliament that if the proposed bill
is not passed then new elections will be held. This holds the possibility
that the ruling party or coalition might not be re-elected and some
parliamentarians may lose their seats. Therefore, the backbench party
member might not like the proposed legislative bill, but the risk of
new elections is even worse. Additionally, some systems confer severe
consequences upon party members who do not support the leadership.
Closed list proportional representation offers the leadership the ability
to move a party member much further down their list of candidates at
the next election in order to reduce greatly or eliminate their prospects
of re-election. Even in some majoritarian electoral systems, such as that
of Australia, the party leadership can prevent certain candidates from
contesting the next election for their party. This is a huge blow given that
most voters do not know the voting records and performance of individual
politicians but rather use the party label as an ‘information shortcut’. Thus
if a candidate is not endorsed by the party they are liable to gain far fewer
votes than if they are a member of a major party.
The power of these ‘carrots and sticks’ is evident from the fact that
throughout Tony Blair’s 10-year reign as prime minister he lost only one
whipped vote in the House of Commons, when he attempted to extend the
period of detention of terror suspects without charge from 14 to 90 days.
In contrast, in a presidential system the president may well want his party
members always to vote in favour of certain policies but there is very
little they can do to force this to happen. This is because presidents do
not possess the same range of carrots to offer their party members nor
do they have the same power to make threats. There is no real possibility
of promotion within a presidential system with many members of
Congress preferring to remain in Congress over cabinet office, especially
given that many scholars claim that a cabinet seat is less influential in a
presidential system compared to a parliamentary system (Lijphart, 2004).
The president also lacks the potential disincentive of threatening to call
new elections because of the separation of powers between the executive
and the legislature. Finally, because the president and the legislature are
elected separately this means that members of the legislature are much
less dependent on the performance of the president for their re-election,
which once again means that they do not have the same incentive to
support unconditionally the party leadership. please explain the carrots and sticks example in 5 bullet points"

"combine these two to an improved version:
In the early weeks of the project, our group began with a broad focus on accessibility in higher education, rooted in shared experiences of frustration during university applications. Over time, our understanding of deeper systemic issues evolved. A pivotal moment came during an expert discussion with Ruairidh J. Brown, who shared accounts of Chinese students struggling to secure funding due to political affiliations. This inspired our pivot: to create Verida, a platform for transparent, independent funding opportunities for scholars researching sensitive topics.



Applying to university a year and a half ago was a difficult process as we chose to apply abroad instead of staying in our home countries and left us completely unprepared. It was hard to figure out where to start, to know what the options were, when to apply, or which programs suited our individual goals. The internet offered an overwhelming amount of blogs and advice, but none of it addressed our individual circumstances. Information seemed to be everywhere, yet finding the right guidance was like searching for a needle in a haystack, creating a feeling of frustration and helplessness. Initially, we aimed to create a digital guide to help high school graduates in their research process and therefore level the playing field in accessing higher education. After the first stages of research, we faced several obstacles in realizing our initial idea. Still wanting to focus on leveling the playing field and access to higher education we got confronted with the problem of transparency and access to scholarships, especially from students and scholars from academically restrictive environments. This also connected partially to some of our own experiences. When applying to university, searching for scholarships had felt like a separate, equally exhausting process. Information was vague, scattered, and full of hidden commitments. Many of us either gave up or spent an unreasonable amount of time trying to navigate the confusing offers of funding options. Recognizing this problem inspired us to pivot our project. We decided to tackle the issue by creating a digital platform specifically for international students and scholars to provide clear, transparent information about scholarships, funding sources, commitments, and values, as well as resources to empower users. By addressing the root challenges, we hope to level the playing field and open up education to those who need it most - without compromise or confusion."

"extract the main points from the following text and turn them into bullet points: 
""About the Responsibility to Protect
The responsibility to protect embodies a political commitment to end the worst forms of violence and persecution. Following the ground breaking adoption by all Heads of State and Government of the responsibility to protect principle, as articulated in the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document (A/RES/60/1), in 2007 the Secretary-General addressed a letter (S/2007/721) to the President of the Security Council in which he recognized the need to further operationalize the Responsibility to Protect principle and designated a Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect with the main task of conceptual development and consensus- building. The first Special Adviser on the Responsibility to Protect was appointed by the Secretary-General in 2008. It seeks to narrow the gap between Member States’ pre-existing obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law and the reality faced by populations at risk of genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.

 

Background
Following the atrocities committed in the 1990s in the Balkans and Rwanda, which the international community failed to prevent, and the NATO military intervention in Kosovo, which was criticized by many as a violation of the prohibition of the use of force, the international community engaged in a serious debate on how to react to gross and systematic violations of human rights. In September 1999, while presenting his annual report to the UN General Assembly, Kofi Annan reflected upon “the prospects for human security and intervention in the next century” and challenged the Member States to “find common ground in upholding the principles of the Charter, and acting in defence of common humanity”. He repeated the challenge in his 2000 Millennium Report, saying that: “if humanitarian intervention is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how should we respond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica, to gross and systematic violation of human rights that offend every precept of our common humanity?”

The challenge was taken by the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS), set up by the Canadian Government, which at the end of 2001 issued a report entitled The Responsibility to Protect. The concept of the responsibility to protect drew inspiration of Francis Deng’s idea of “State sovereignty as a responsibility” and affirmed the notion that sovereignty is not just protection from outside interference – rather is a matter of states having positive responsibilities for their population’s welfare, and to assist each other. Consequently, the primary responsibility for the protection of its people rested first and foremost with the State itself. However, a ‘residual responsibility’ also lied with the broader community of states, which was ‘activated when a particular state is clearly either unwilling or unable to fulfil its responsibility to protect or is itself the actual perpetrator of crimes or atrocities’

The subsequent report of the High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change, entitled A more secure world: our shared responsibility (A/59/565) and the Secretary-General’s 2005 report In Larger Freedom: towards development, security and human rights for all (A/59/2005) endorsed the principle that State sovereignty carried with it the obligation of the State to protect its own people, and that if the State was unwilling or unable to do so, the responsibility shifted to the international community to use diplomatic, humanitarian and other means to protect them. Neither report asserted a basis to use force for this purpose other than Security Council authorisation under Chapter VII of the Charter as a last resort, in the event of genocide and other serious international crimes.

At the 2005 high-level UN World Summit meeting, Member States finally committed to the principle of the responsibility to protect by including it into the outcome document of that meeting (A/RES/60/1). Though the concept adopted omitted some of the aspects proposed initially by the ICISS, it retains its fundamental aspects in relation to prevention of and response to the most serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.

Adoption of the principle
In paragraphs 138 and 139 of the 2005 World Summit Outcome Document (A/RES/60/1) Heads of State and Government affirmed their responsibility to protect their own populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and accepted a collective responsibility to encourage and help each other uphold this commitment. They also declared their preparedness to take timely and decisive action, in accordance with the United Nations Charter and in cooperation with relevant regional organizations, when national authorities manifestly fail to protect their populations.

2005 World Summit Outcome Document
Paragraphs on the Responsibility to Protect
138. Each individual State has the responsibility to protect its populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. This responsibility entails the prevention of such crimes, including their incitement, through appropriate and necessary means. We accept that responsibility and will act in accordance with it. The international community should, as appropriate, encourage and help States to exercise this responsibility and support the United Nations in establishing an early warning capability.

139. The international community, through the United Nations, also has the responsibility to use appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and other peaceful means, in accordance with Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter, to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. In this context, we are prepared to take collective action, in a timely and decisive manner, through the Security Council, in accordance with the Charter, including Chapter VII, on a case-by-case basis and in cooperation with relevant regional organizations as appropriate, should peaceful means be inadequate and national authorities manifestly fail to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. We stress the need for the General Assembly to continue consideration of the responsibility to protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and its implications, bearing in mind the principles of the Charter and international law. We also intend to commit ourselves, as necessary and appropriate, to helping States build capacity to protect their populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity and to assisting those which are under stress before crises and conflicts break out.

140. We fully support the mission of the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide.

The Summit Outcome is a General Assembly resolution adopted at the level of Heads of State and Government. As such, paragraphs 138 and 139 represent an important new political commitment by Member States. However, the Responsibility to Protect as described in these paragraphs is based on an underlying body of international legal obligations for States which are contained in international instruments or are developing through State practice and the case-law of international courts and tribunals. These existing international obligations require States to refrain from and take a number of actions to prevent and punish genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The adoption of paragraphs 138 and 139 by consensus at such a high political level adds impetus to the development of these obligations.

Ultimately, the Responsibility to Protect principle reinforces sovereignty by helping states to meet their existing responsibilities. It offers fresh programmatic opportunities for the United Nations system to assist states in preventing the listed crimes and violations and in protecting affected populations through capacity building, early warning, and other preventive and protective measures, rather than simply waiting to respond if they fail.

Since the adoption of the Responsibility to Protect in 2005, the United Nations Secretary-General has taken a series of steps to elaborate on the principle and guide its practical implementation. Member States have also regularly considered implementation of the principle during formal and informal meetings and the principle has been repeatedly referenced and reaffirmed in relevant United Nations resolutions. Other actors have advocated for and supported the implementation of the principle."""

""Chapter 7: Liberalism and empire: J.S. Mill
7.1 Introduction
In this chapter, we explore the relation between liberalism and empire
in 19th-century liberal political thought. We focus on the work of John
Stuart Mill, who is widely regarded as one of the most influential thinkers
on questions of liberty, individuality and free speech. Mill also spent 35
years working for the British East India Company and developed moral
arguments in defense of imperialism. The chapter probes this uneasy
relationship, and also examines Mill’s lasting influence on contemporary
liberal IR theory.

7.1.4 Synopsis of chapter content
This chapter explores the international political thought of John Stuart Mill,
covering his ideas on liberty, self-determination, civilisation and empire.
7.2 Mill and On liberty
John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) was an English philosopher, Member of
Parliament (MP) and Chief Examiner of the British East India Company.
Writing in the context of the Industrial Revolution and the height of the
British Empire, he is most well-known for his defence of individuality,
liberty and free speech. Mill was also a staunch supporter of imperialism
and the idea that imperial powers had a duty to ‘civilise’ and ‘improve’
those they deemed culturally backwards.
On liberty, published in 1859, is Mill’s most famous work. In it, he explores
the relationship between liberty and political authority. He argues that
individual freedom should always be respected as long as it does not harm
others. To the question ‘under what circumstances is it justified to interfere
in another person’s life?’ he answers:
‘The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or
collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their
number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can
be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community,
against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either
physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant’ (Mill, 1989, p.13).
For Mill, there are two threats to individual freedom. First, there is the
‘tyranny of government’ (that is, of social control and state authority).
Second, there is also the ‘tyranny of majority’, which Mill associates with
mass democracy, conformity and public opinion. He worries that this
‘tyranny’ will lead to a loss of individuality, innovation and civilisational
progress. On liberty is thus, at least in parts, an attempt to counteract the
‘dangers’ of the rise of mass democracy by protecting the private sphere
from external influence (Jahn, 2005, p.609).
7.3 On (non-)intervention
Mill’s essay ‘A few words on non-intervention’, written in 1859, extends
the argument presented in On liberty to the international arena. It asks:
under what conditions is one state allowed to intervene in the domestic
affairs of another state? Mill’s reflections on this question have inspired
38
Chapter 7: Liberalism and empire: J.S. Mill
ongoing debates in IR on humanitarian intervention, failed states and the
Responsibility to Protect (for example, see Walzer, 1980; Doyle, 2015; see
also Chapter 18).
‘A Few Words on Non-Intervention’ makes a strong case for non-
intervention, but also discusses several cases where intervention
is morally justified. Mill’s defence of non-intervention follows
from his thoughts on liberty: a people will be better off if they
are left to help themselves. Hence Mill opposes intervention,
even in those cases where a people is fighting to overthrow a
‘native tyrant’ or free themselves from ‘a foreign yoke.’ Self-
determination is ultimately a quality that must be developed,
and ‘The only test possessing any real value, of a people’s
having become fit for popular institutions, is that they…are
willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation’ (Mill,
2006, p.262).
There are, however, a number of exceptions to this principle of non-
intervention. These include cases of protracted civil war where there are
‘severities repugnant to humanity’ and – most notoriously – in ‘dealing
with barbarians, provided the end be their improvement’ (Mill, 2006,
p.261). To understand what Mill means by this, we must consider his
philosophy of history, which presents the history of humankind as
consisting of four separate stages: savagism, slavery, barbarism and
modern civilisation (with England as the foremost example). According to
Mill, nations can achieve civilisational development through two different
routes: either through the leadership of a person of extraordinary genius,
or through the governance of a culturally superior power. Consequently,
while the relations between civilised nations ought to be governed by the
principle of non-intervention, relations between civilised and barbarian
states ought to be based on hierarchy and ‘benevolent despotism’. In short,
states that are not fully civilised are not yet ready for self-determination
and should hence be governed by outside force until they have reached
that stage of development.
While Mill’s writings have inspired subsequent debates on intervention and
self-determination, critics argue that Mill provides a moral justification for
imperialism, which he frames as a question – not of self-interest, but of an
ethical imperative to improve, civilise and help ‘barbarians’.
Activity
Look at the Further readings by Doyle (2015) and Slaughter (2008). How do you think
Mill has inspired contemporary liberal arguments in international politics?
7.4 Liberalism and empire
The relation between Mill’s domestic political theory and defence of
liberty, on the one hand, and his international political theory and
support for empire, on the other, has generated much scholarly debate.
For some, Mill’s defence of the civilising mission is inconsistent with his
commitment to liberal principles of individuality and freedom, yet others
argue that the two are inextricably entwined. Beate Jahn (2005, p.610),
for example, maintains that ‘There is not a single step in his argument
about domestic politics in which his philosophy of history represented
through the barbarians does not play a crucial role. Indeed, the barbarian
is civilisation’s historical self, its contemporary other, its internal other and
its future self.’
39
IR2209 International political theory
The debate surrounding Mill’s work is echoed in a wider discussion about
the relationship between liberalism and empire, which has been explored
by scholars such Duncan Bell (2015), Jennifer Pitts (2009) and Uday
Singh Mehta (1999). In questioning narratives that depict the British
Empire as a harbinger of freedom and liberalism, they show how liberal
arguments often functioned: not to oppose, but to legitimise colonial rule.
Activity
To what extent is J.S. Mill’s defence of imperialism a break from, or a continuation of, his
liberalism? What do you think are the implications of this?
7.5 Overview of chapter
John Stuart Mill is one of the foremost theorists of individual liberty
and free speech. His work on (non-)intervention, civilisation and self-
determination have inspired subsequent debates in IR about humanitarian
intervention and the Responsibility to Protect, as well as discussions about
the relationship between empire and liberalism.
